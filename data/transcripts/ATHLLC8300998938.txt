[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.240]   I'm Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.320]   and I'm so excited for our guest today, Nasir Yassin,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.240]   better known online from his channel, Nas Daily.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.400]   Nasir has traveled to dozens of countries
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.280]   that many of us have never been to or even heard of,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.100]   and he's captivated millions of viewers worldwide
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.040]   with his daily one-minute videos
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.040]   that bring to life the stories of people
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.960]   from every corner of the globe.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.280]   He has over 60 million followers online,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.480]   and his videos have had more than 20 billion views.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720]   Now, I've gotten to know him over the past few years
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920]   after he made a pretty amazing video
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880]   about me and credit card points
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.320]   that I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   and I'm quite confident will make you smile.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.460]   We're gonna talk about how travel
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.300]   can broaden our perspective on life
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600]   and also help us save money along the way.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.480]   And while our conversation touches a lot
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.800]   on travel-related topics,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680]   like the best ways to engage with local communities,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.400]   underrated countries to visit,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   or why he always stays in hostels
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   when he's in a new country,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.000]   we're also gonna talk a little bit
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600]   about personal development and self-discovery.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   I am really excited for this conversation,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.900]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.160]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.920]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.220]   you most likely have a little money anxiety.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.800]   In fact, that is one of the reasons
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   I started a financial planning firm back in 2016.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.520]   And when we shut the company down,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.880]   we did extensive research
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.560]   on the financial service company we wanted
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.920]   to recommend to our clients,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560]   and we landed on Facet.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   And I'm excited that they are sponsoring today's episode.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.500]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.340]   on its head,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.020]   making financial planning accessible to everyone,
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.760]   not just the most wealthy.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.220]   And one of the things I hated about this industry
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.880]   is that so many financial advisors
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.560]   charge based on a high percentage of your assets,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.540]   but not Facet.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.080]   which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.920]   And they match you with your own CFP professional
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.840]   who uses industry-leading technology
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.640]   and is backed by a team of experts
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.320]   across investments, taxes, and more.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.600]   So to tackle the uncertainty you're facing
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.640]   about your finances
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.560]   and replace it with some real confidence about your money,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.180]   go to allthehacks.com/facet.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.480]   That's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.360]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   and they'll even waive the $250 enrollment fee
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   for all of you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet.
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.960]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.240]   Disclosure, Facet Wealth
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.060]   is an SEC-registered investment advisor.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.200]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.760]   nor is it investment, legal, or tax advice.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.360]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.800]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.120]   Messiah, thanks for being here.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.040]   - Chris, thank you for having me.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200]   - I think not that many people that I meet
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.460]   have a thing they really passionately believe in
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.160]   that needs to change about the world.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.600]   What would you say is your kind of life mission
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.140]   for what you want to bring to this world?
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.640]   - Oh, wow, damn, you're starting strong.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.780]   So, first of all, imagine if you're an alien
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.280]   and you come to planet Earth, okay?
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.180]   You just come into planet Earth for the first time ever,
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.380]   and we introduce you to planet Earth,
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.500]   some of the things that we're doing
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.700]   for the last 30, 40, 50 years.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.300]   I'm pretty damn sure the alien would be shocked
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.460]   by what we do, and be like,
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.060]   "There's no way you're doing this."
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.840]   So, an example of that is we built a very tall building,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.300]   and then we put a desk and a chair,
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.780]   and we force somebody to sit in that desk and chair
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.600]   for 13 hours every day, like 500 meters above the ground,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.180]   in a suit and a rope around their neck.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.620]   (laughing)
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.340]   And also, we walk around with a rope around our neck,
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.540]   the tie.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.960]   Like, really, why do you have a rope around your neck?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.140]   So, that's fundamentally, something's off with it.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.180]   Or like the idea that you can only do
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.620]   what you really like when you're 67,
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.740]   when you're like 70% done with your life,
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.180]   or 80% done with your life.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.300]   Then, you can get the freedom you want.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.860]   That sounds like ridiculous, right?
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.380]   Or the idea that we're forcing high schoolers
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.580]   and middle school students to spend the first 18 years
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.580]   of their lives literally sitting in a classroom,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.780]   bored out of their mind.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.220]   The first 18 years of your life,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.460]   society literally imprisons you in a school system
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.580]   that is not the most efficient.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.260]   That's crazy, don't you think?
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.420]   So, anyway, oh, another thing that's crazy we do,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.060]   we kill each other because we disagree on something
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.940]   that happened 2,000 years ago.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.220]   The Crusaders, and the Shia, and the Muslims.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.220]   And because of that, we kill each other.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.060]   Oh, a piece of land, we also disagree
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.020]   on the name of a piece of land,
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.020]   and I'm willing to literally end your life
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.540]   because this land is mine and it's not yours.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   A lot of these things for an alien sound ridiculous,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.360]   and for us, it's daily life.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.060]   And I think my mission statement in life
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.060]   is to recognize what needs to change on planet Earth,
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.140]   and spend the rest of my life contributing to that.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.900]   And so, that's why my mission statement is,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.980]   bring people together.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.060]   I'm from Israel and Palestine, and that's a crazy thing.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.820]   So, I'd like to help in that regard.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.500]   I'd like to help get people to spend less time
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.220]   wearing ropes around their neck.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.820]   I'd like people to stop killing each other
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.980]   because they're a different color,
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.980]   or shade, or for an eye, or whatever.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.620]   That's my life statement.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.660]   - And what do you think you can do,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.660]   or anyone listening can do to try to further that?
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.900]   'Cause I think it's a noble goal
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.660]   that I would hope that my audience is not like,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.740]   oh, that guy, that horrible idea of bringing people together.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.900]   (laughing)
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.220]   - I found, and please tell me what you think.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.340]   Actually, I wanna get your opinion on this.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.340]   I think most change starts with media.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.400]   I don't know if that's right or wrong,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.740]   but most real change in the world
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.820]   starts with just making better media information,
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.780]   better information.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.540]   That's why whenever a dictator comes to a country,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.500]   what is the first thing that they do?
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.740]   They stop the radio, they stop the TV,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.260]   they take control of the newspapers.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.660]   So, the flow of information,
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.540]   if you change the flow of information,
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.860]   you change the flow of the way humans think.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.140]   If you change the way humans think, you change the world.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.100]   What would you do?
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.700]   - I think that it's very hard for people
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.500]   to see someone else's perspective without understanding it.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.700]   The media is able to just show us the perspective
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.380]   that we believe in and we agree with and all that.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.220]   And if people could just kind of go spend some time
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.540]   with other people who live different lives,
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.420]   but you also have to get them
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.900]   to be a little bit more open-minded.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.380]   - So, it seems like it starts with media,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.660]   but also ends with travel.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.900]   - So, I think that's why I love travel.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.700]   That's why I encourage people to go places.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   I haven't thought about this problem as much as you have,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.860]   but I just don't think people
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.340]   get to see that perspective enough.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.020]   And traveling has helped me see it,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.100]   which is why I love traveling,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.700]   which is why I love encouraging travel,
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.940]   which I love talking about it.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.300]   I love helping people save money
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.780]   so they can spend money on things they wanna do.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.740]   - Yeah, I think travel humanizes humans.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.300]   And I think far too often,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.340]   we look at somebody in North Korea as a not human.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.660]   You are just a North Korean.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.940]   It's like you don't view them as human.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.980]   And you can kill what you don't humanize.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.780]   And when you humanize somebody, you cannot kill them.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.660]   - And not even kill, I mean, yes, physically,
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.020]   but also just like destroy their ideas,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.860]   destroy their beliefs, you know, in all ways.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.740]   - That's why people don't wanna eat their dog,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.420]   because the dog is humanized to them.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.700]   Oh, my dog has feelings.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.100]   My dog loves me, my dog, right?
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.780]   But they're okay to kill a cow that they've never seen
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.300]   because it's not a human.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.620]   So, I guess the more we humanize everything in life,
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.620]   the kinder the world will become.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.340]   - Now, you said kind.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.180]   - I didn't say nice.
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.340]   - You did not say nice.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.860]   Tell me about why.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.780]   - You're like, you had like a light bulb.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.340]   Would you say you're a nice guy?
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.940]   - Having seen a video of you talk about this,
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.900]   I will restrain myself from answering that question.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.740]   - No, I think kindness is important.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.820]   I don't think niceness is.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.140]   And maybe this is because I was born and raised in Israel,
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.740]   which there's a term in Israel called chutzpah.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.220]   You know what chutzpah means?
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.540]   - I know how to use it more than I know how to define it.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.260]   - It's like almost like bluntness or like rudeness,
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.460]   straightforwardness is like,
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.860]   I'm just gonna say whatever I wanna say.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.660]   I'm gonna be truthful and I'm gonna say it
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.340]   even at the expense of you feeling uncomfortable.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.500]   And I think niceness means not doing
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.140]   what you really want to do
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.140]   because you are limited by the fear
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.660]   of offending someone else.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.540]   So, to be nice, you change who you are
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.500]   to suit somebody else, even if you're not being truthful
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.340]   to yourself.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.220]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.940]   So, that's why I think this whole idea
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.900]   is like you have to be nice.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.340]   I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.140]   I think you have to be yourself.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.500]   I'll give you an example from like work, okay?
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.420]   I have two types of people that I work with.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.740]   A person that is not nice to me,
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.980]   but every time I talk to them and they report to me,
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.020]   every time I talk to them,
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.260]   they tell me exactly how they feel, right?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.660]   When I look at their face,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.940]   when they say you're a horrible CEO or you're a great CEO,
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.580]   I can pretty much guess that they mean what they say
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.060]   because they're not being nice.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.140]   They're being upfront and kind,
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.580]   but they're being themselves.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.580]   The other type of person would be like,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.700]   I love this job, I love this company, I love you, right?
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.780]   But behind your back,
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.540]   they're like really not happy with you.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.060]   But they're trying to be nice to you.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.660]   I think that's the ultimate form of betrayal
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.980]   is being nice to someone when you don't actually mean it,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.220]   just because you want to be nice.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.380]   So I have many problems with the word nice.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.060]   I'd much rather have people be kind,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.260]   but like super upfront, say what you want to say,
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.220]   and if it comes at the expense of somebody hating you,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.180]   then so be it.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.500]   - Have you found any tactics in a culture like America
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.780]   where this is not okay or it's less societally acceptable?
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.740]   An example I'll give where I've been not nice,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.940]   but purely kind is, I can't remember the circumstances.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.500]   - By the way, you are too nice, I noticed.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.740]   - I might be too nice,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.380]   but there was a moment where my wife and I
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.980]   were talking to someone and they were like,
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.340]   "We should get together sometime."
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.260]   - And you said yes?
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.100]   - No, no, no.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.180]   And almost everyone listening, I'm sure,
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.020]   if they met another couple or friends and they said,
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.380]   "Oh, we should get together sometime."
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.220]   - Yes.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.060]   - You'd be like, "Yeah, let's see if it'll work."
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.220]   And I remember saying, "Look, things are really busy.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.060]   "We have a lot going on.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.900]   "I just don't think it makes sense
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.140]   "to try to plan something.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.060]   "Let's not plan something."
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.980]   I didn't say like, "I don't want to see you again."
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.540]   I was not trying to be unkind.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.180]   - That was with another couple of friends.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.460]   - This was just like to people we met.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.300]   So maybe it was at a park
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.460]   and some kids and the parents are like,
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.300]   "Oh, should we do?"
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.500]   I don't remember the context.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   It was before kids, actually.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.340]   It was years ago.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.380]   There's only so many people you can have in your life
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.260]   and spend time with.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.180]   And how do you want to prioritize?
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   I was like, "I just don't think this meets the bar
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.140]   "for what I want to spend my time on."
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.620]   And at work, I've gotten better at replying to people.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.620]   Be like, "I don't have time for this meeting.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.460]   "Really appreciate it.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.660]   "I'm focused on other stuff.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.940]   "If it could be accomplished via email,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.780]   "send me an email.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.100]   "Otherwise, feel free to reach out down the road
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.620]   "and we'll see if I have time."
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.780]   - Chris, do you want to go to the Maldives, me and you?
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.900]   - I definitely don't want to go to the Maldives with you.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.300]   Of all the things that I could do
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.580]   with the limited amount of time I have,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.100]   and if it's without kids, it's too far.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.300]   And if it's with kids, it's not gonna be what I want.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.140]   - It's not fun.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.980]   - And so, conceptually, I do want to go
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.820]   to the Maldives with you.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.860]   Like, if you could create the, yeah.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.860]   But practically, no, I do not want to go to the Maldives.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.500]   - Well, thank you for being upfront.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.060]   - But I don't think people like that.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.940]   I love Israeli buntness.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.220]   Like, all my Israeli friends are like, you know,
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.060]   come over and they're like, "Oh, why did you do that thing?
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.900]   "That was dumb."
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.140]   And I was like, "Oh yeah, you're right, it was dumb.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.820]   "But everyone else here is so nice."
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.380]   - So, how do you survive with Americans
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.860]   trying to be less nice and not coming across as unkind?
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.700]   - It's so funny that you think Americans
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.420]   are the nicest people on the planet.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.500]   The other question is, how do you survive
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.940]   with other nationalities that are 10 times nicer
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.620]   than Americans, you know?
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.660]   Like Japan.
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.140]   How do you survive in Japan, for example,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.420]   where you're like, literally have to be nice,
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.420]   or else it's like, you know, society,
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.860]   there's so many societal expectations.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.300]   I found Americans to be not that nice.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.380]   I don't know why.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.940]   I mean, there's a bit of shallowness,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.860]   which is like, "Hey, how are you?
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.700]   "What's up?
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.540]   "Let's hang out."
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.900]   And nobody actually means it.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.500]   But if you look at the national discourse
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.900]   of Americans on Twitter and on the media,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.380]   they're not nice to each other.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.500]   They have a lot of freedom to be who they are
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.620]   and say what they want on a national level.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.820]   Maybe on a personal level, they're trying to be nice,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.220]   but on a national, like, there's a lot of nice people,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.300]   much nicer in Japan,
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.100]   and the national discourse is much nicer.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.140]   So this is partly why I'm attracted to America,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.060]   'cause I actually don't view people as nice.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.220]   I view them as a bit like Israel sometimes.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.060]   - My read is once you've humanized another person,
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.980]   Americans are nice. (laughs)
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.740]   So like amongst friends, you're like,
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.060]   "Hey, do you wanna get together?"
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.020]   If someone doesn't wanna get together with you,
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.260]   they're probably not gonna say no.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.100]   - Yeah.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.900]   - That level of, like, nicety.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.860]   - Nice to strangers.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.700]   - Yeah.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.260]   We're okay being not nice to strangers,
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.300]   but we're like over nice to--
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.140]   - To somebody you know.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.420]   - Colleagues and friends and family.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.260]   - That makes sense. - That kind of stuff.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.700]   So you said being nice can sometimes get in the way
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.060]   of acting what you truly are and putting on a facade.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.540]   How do you think people could be,
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.340]   or do you think people should be more themselves,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.460]   and how do they do that?
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.780]   - Well, it's just, I found out that,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.900]   you know how there's a sixth sense for humans?
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.780]   We can sense when somebody's being authentic,
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   and we can sense when somebody's not being authentic, right?
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.300]   And I think you just wanna make sure everybody around you
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.780]   knows that you're authentic,
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.460]   because people just love authenticity.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.140]   This is why you guys voted for Trump, not to get political,
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.060]   but at least you can probably think
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.980]   that whatever Trump says, he actually believes,
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.220]   whether you like it or not, right?
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.300]   But the authenticity is so attractive about humans,
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.540]   and I think it's just like such an underrated feature
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.900]   that many people don't seem to grasp
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.860]   is the more authentic you look,
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.500]   which means the more you say what you really wanna say,
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.620]   it means you'll actually be loved.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.500]   It's very counterintuitive.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.580]   It's very counterintuitive,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.540]   because everybody is living in this act.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.820]   We're all acting.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.420]   You're smiling when you're supposed to smile,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.940]   you're shaking hands when you're supposed to shake hands,
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.060]   you're putting a tie when you're supposed to wear a tie.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.500]   We're all acting to each other until we die.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.540]   But at some point, you have to stop acting,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.220]   and just like be who you really are.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.180]   You know, I once went to this conference in Switzerland.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.980]   I'm not gonna say the name of the conference,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   but man, it was the most boring thing I've seen in my life,
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.260]   where everybody pretended to be interested
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.860]   in everything everybody else was saying,
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.020]   but I know for a fact that deep down inside,
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.500]   everybody was bored.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.780]   But during the conversations, they were like,
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.820]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, great point, great point.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.100]   "Well, I really love your suit."
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.980]   It was such an act that made me realize this is not it.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.860]   This is not it.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.700]   - Do you think people do that
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.940]   because they're afraid to be authentic,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.380]   not because they're afraid of who they are,
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.260]   but because they're afraid other people will judge them?
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.500]   - Yeah, I mean, you don't wanna rock the boat.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.180]   I mean, if you're making millions of dollars in Switzerland,
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.020]   you don't wanna rock the boat.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.140]   I mean, I'll be the nicest guy ever
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.780]   if I have a million dollars guaranteed out of it, right?
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.540]   So I think there's too much to lose,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.660]   and that's why you have to be nice to each other.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.660]   But when there's nothing to lose,
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.300]   then you become who you really are.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.420]   And you see it when there is war.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.460]   Oh, I have nothing to lose now.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.500]   I'll just go be myself.
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.620]   I can go loot, I can go whatever I want.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.980]   But when you have a lot to lose,
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.660]   like that's why rich people's circles,
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.300]   everybody's so nice to each other.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.100]   Because one mistake, you lose millions of dollars.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.860]   So I think maybe the reason why we're nice
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.420]   is 'cause we're scared of losing
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.060]   what we have already achieved.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.300]   And I see it myself, when I have something to lose,
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.460]   I'm actually a little bit nicer to others.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.500]   I'm a little bit less myself.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.540]   Now I've come to a point where if I lose everything,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.420]   I still have some money in the bank, so I'm okay.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.940]   And that's why I think you see Elon Musk
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.060]   to be so himself, so crazy.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.620]   Because he has nothing to lose.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.780]   He has the world's money.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.980]   That's it, what's the worst?
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.940]   He's never gonna be homeless.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.540]   So in a way, if your livelihood is on the line
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.580]   with what you're about to say,
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.540]   you're gonna say the nicest thing ever.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.820]   - When it comes to food,
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.260]   I feel like I'm on a quest for the perfect balance
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.060]   of convenience, price, and deliciousness.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.180]   I've tried a few meal kits in the past, but nothing stuck.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.020]   Then we recently tried Green Chef,
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.420]   and after a few weeks of great meals,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.540]   I reached out to them to try to work together,
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.580]   and I am very excited to have them as a sponsor this week.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.140]   The reason I gave Green Chef a try
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.380]   is that they focus on making eating well so easy
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.780]   and have plans to fit every lifestyle,
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.580]   whether that's keto, paleo, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free,
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.620]   or maybe you're like us
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.420]   and just looking to eat more balanced meals.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.980]   But while I love eating healthy,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.060]   what keeps us ordering each week,
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.700]   and to be clear, those were unsponsored, fully paid orders,
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.740]   was that the meals tasted so good
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.060]   with flavors and ingredients
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.420]   that would have been way too much work
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.220]   for us to pull together ourselves.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.340]   So start feeling your best this summer
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.660]   with seasonal recipes from Green Chef

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.820]   organic cage-free eggs, and sustainably sourced seafood.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.980]   And if you see the coconut shrimp noodles or pesto salmon,
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.460]   definitely add them to your order.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.980]   They were so good.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.100]   Oh, and the Turkish spice chicken tacos,
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.660]   those were great too.

[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.500]   Now that it's summer, we've been using our pizza oven

[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.580]   and I recently did everything homemade,
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.420]   and I am still getting compliments on that pizza.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.500]   But where did I learn how to make such an incredible pizza?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.220]   From none other than world champion pizza maker,

[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.580]   - It's interesting, I talked to the,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.260]   I don't know if you know Bill Perkins.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.780]   He wrote a book called "Die With Zero,"
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.300]   and as an experiment-- - "Die With Zero."
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.140]   - "Die With Zero."
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.900]   As an experiment, he decided to go get some really old clothes
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.500]   and go panhandle for a few days in,
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.220]   I can't remember what city he was in.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.420]   And what he did was he realized,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.940]   "Wow, if I just sit on the street and beg for money,
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.100]   I can make," and I actually think
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.020]   it was a crazy amount of money.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.980]   It was like $50,000 a year.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.320]   And he was like, "Oh, so I'll never be homeless.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.020]   Like, I don't have anything to worry about.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.900]   Like, if everything gets taken away,
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.780]   I can go live on however much money
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.960]   I can make begging on the street."
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.360]   And it mentally got rid of that.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.580]   I'm curious, most people listening here
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.660]   are not at the kind of wealth
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.260]   that they're getting millions of dollars
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.520]   in conferences in Switzerland,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.580]   but they're kind of in this middle ground
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.020]   where they're probably not being their authentic self.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.620]   - You've talked about having the courage to be disliked.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.060]   And I think a lot of times in a conversation,
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.500]   someone's not willing to say something
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.100]   'cause they're like, "Oh, maybe someone won't like it.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.780]   Oh, maybe I'll offend someone,"
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.460]   even though I really feel it.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.620]   And I don't think that means
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.060]   intentionally trying to offend people.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.500]   What would you tell someone who's like,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.820]   "Hey, Nassir, how do I just be more me?"
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.820]   - I think people should aim to be disliked.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.260]   And this is really counterintuitive.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.780]   Again, it's very counterintuitive, very.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.860]   You should aim to be disliked
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.540]   because the way I've seen the world work
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.020]   is for every one person that dislikes you,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.580]   there's an equivalent person
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.620]   on the other side of the world that loves you.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.740]   And so the more somebody dislikes you,
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.040]   the more another person loves you.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.140]   So it's a very polarizing thing, right?
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.980]   But if somebody doesn't dislike you,
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.340]   you know what it also means?
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.960]   Nobody actually loves you.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.660]   And this is why most politicians in democracies
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.620]   end up with like 50/50%.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.740]   You know, why is that?
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.220]   Because politicians need security and everything
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.020]   because there are people who really dislike them
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.900]   and wanna kill them.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.300]   That's why they need security.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.100]   And there are people who really love them
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.100]   and wanna vote for them forever.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.760]   And so I think people should aim to live life
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.580]   like a politician, which is have some people
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.980]   that clearly dislike the way you live life,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.040]   but also on the other side, you'll have your people.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   And people are just attracted to big ideas, big opinions.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.500]   They're attracted to people who are authentic.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   And I hate Gary Vee, okay?
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.980]   Just to be very open about it.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.260]   Like, I'm not a fan.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.100]   I'm not a fan of the Gary Vee style,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.780]   but he's a genius for doing it
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.380]   because that same style is why he has a diehard fandom.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.420]   And that's powerful.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.300]   And I'm trying to emulate Gary Vee
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.340]   as much as I hate his style.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.580]   I'm trying to emulate it by being who I am
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.900]   and get my fair share of haters.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.000]   I think I have 30 million haters or so.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.260]   But on the other side, I have 60, 70 million lovers.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.020]   I love living like that.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.460]   - And does it make you happy?
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.660]   - Very happy.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.140]   That's probably the only thing that makes me happy
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.500]   is knowing how much I'm worth hating
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.900]   because it also means I'm worth loving by somebody else.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.000]   Because there's something to hate.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.960]   Like anybody who lives life without being hated on
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.620]   is not somebody who's done any meaningful change.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.700]   Most change comes with resistance.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.180]   And if you are not getting resistance for your ideas
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.660]   and what you believe in and what you like
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.340]   and what you wanna do in your career,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.980]   then you're not pushing the envelope enough.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.700]   And if you're not pushing the envelope enough,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.660]   your life is inconsequential.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.900]   That's how I think about it.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.180]   Of course, these are very extreme thoughts.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.020]   - Yeah.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.880]   - Now, Chris, how many haters do you have?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.720]   - It's interesting.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.660]   The thing that I think is both great
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.820]   and not great about podcasting
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.620]   is that there's no commenting.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.380]   It takes someone hearing me say my email address
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.020]   or going to a website.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.620]   So good and bad, I get very little feedback.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.180]   But I would say in the entire time I've done this,
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.500]   well over a thousand comments in the form of email
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.940]   or in social or anything,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.660]   I think I've had one negative reaction by email
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.900]   and not a lot.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.720]   So I think--
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.820]   - It's difficult with podcasts.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.300]   If you were on like TikTok, you'll get a lot more hate.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.580]   - It's one thing that I think makes me not excited
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.380]   about trying to do more on social media.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.660]   It's just like, it seems like,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.180]   like my perspective on podcasting
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.740]   is it's a very positive place.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.540]   People are like, "Oh, I don't like what you have to say.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.020]   "I'll just go listen to something else."
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.620]   And there's no easy way for them to be like,
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.980]   "And I hate what you said."
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.200]   So they just don't.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.100]   - So let's use this as an opportunity.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.700]   If anybody here listening to this has any issues with Chris.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.140]   - If you hate what I'm saying,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.980]   just give me the, as you would say,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.620]   the gratitude of knowing that people out there
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.740]   hate what I'm saying.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.100]   - So you're calling your audience
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.700]   to send you hate mail right now
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.060]   and you're giving them permission?
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.740]   - Only if they believe that.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.020]   - Yeah, only if they believe that.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.340]   - But I guess you gotta balance that with,
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.060]   if you also love what I'm saying, you gotta get both.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.500]   But I imagine that by this many minutes in,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.220]   if they haven't, they've already gone somewhere else.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.540]   It's so easy to read a tweet before you tune it out.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.700]   It's so easy to watch a 30 second video
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.140]   before you tune it out.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.700]   I think it's really hard in a podcast
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.180]   to get to the point that something,
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.300]   the most controversial thing is said
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.620]   and there's no inherent virality.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.100]   It's not like if we say something that is crazy,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.140]   Apple is not gonna like promote the episode
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.740]   because lots of people listen to it.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.180]   That's just not how it works.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.020]   - Wow.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.660]   - So it's very easy with YouTube, with social media
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.780]   to just, something that's controversial
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.860]   will blow up with podcasting.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.220]   It's not, which means slower growth,
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.380]   but it also means it's a much more positive experience.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.940]   Like I don't get the negativity.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.580]   - Yeah, but I can also take you out of context.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.820]   I can take like 10 seconds of this podcast
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.900]   and then put it on TikTok
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.580]   and then I can show you like a bad guy.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.340]   - Yeah, someone will hate me if you do that,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.020]   but I just won't be there to listen.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.380]   (laughing)
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.460]   We've talked about authenticity.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.740]   You've put so much out there.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.180]   Is there any downside that's come
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.500]   from being so radically transparent?
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.980]   - None, zero.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   If there's one thing I want the audience
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.900]   to like really like understand
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.140]   is that so far in the last seven years,
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.700]   I've had zero downsides of being public, zero.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.540]   This fear of exposing your privacy is an irrational fear.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.700]   I've shared how much money I make, where I live,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.860]   who I date, how I date, everything about my life
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.580]   to tens of millions of people.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.340]   And every time I share more, I literally get rewarded more.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.380]   I get rewarded more, it's crazy.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.580]   People love you more.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.100]   People wanna help you more.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.820]   I think we need to get into this culture of like over sharing,
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.500]   sharing what you really are going through
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.460]   because you never know who's listening on the other side
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.900]   that is dying for somebody else to relate with, so.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.780]   - And this doesn't have to mean starting a YouTube channel.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.940]   It could just be more open with your friends.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.260]   - Yes, more, yes, or even with your LinkedIn feed.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.980]   Say hey, like I hate my job.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.500]   Sorry boss, but like I don't like my job
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.780]   and I feel like I'm not living the best of my life
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.740]   and this is what I'm gonna do to change it.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.060]   The outpouring of support is going to be insane.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.340]   In my company, there's this culture,
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.020]   it's called always share secrets.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.340]   It's one of the values of the company, always share secrets.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.300]   The world is much better when every secret is known.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.700]   - Okay, and one of those things has been your relationship.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.260]   You recently made, I think your longest video ever.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.100]   - Yeah.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.980]   - Which is probably shorter than every piece of content
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.580]   I've ever made about your relationship
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.260]   and you put how many years into it?
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.100]   - Six years.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.340]   - Six years, it ended.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.820]   And also, it sounds like you think
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.220]   that it wasn't a waste of time,
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.860]   which I think so many people often think
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.380]   about a failed relationship.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   - Really?
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.740]   Yeah, yeah, you're right actually.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.140]   They do think about that.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.540]   I guess maybe I've been lucky in the last six years
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.420]   because in this relationship, I like learned,
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.780]   I felt like I was dating a professor, you know?
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.620]   I was like learning about things I was never exposed to,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.460]   like vegetarianism, like animal rights,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.180]   women's rights movements, right?
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.060]   These are all things I have not been exposed to
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.900]   as a child from a village.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.420]   And so in this last six years,
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.340]   and also I've become exposed to how to have sex,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.900]   (laughing)
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.940]   you know, and how to talk.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.420]   And so I've learned a lot
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.100]   and I've been exposed to like the Jewish culture, right?
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.780]   'Cause my girlfriend was Jewish as well.
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.380]   It's great.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.700]   I'm so happy I was exposed to this stuff.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   So there's this line that says,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.260]   "No growth of the heart is ever a waste."
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.220]   And I just find that line to be so good.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.220]   No growth of the heart is ever a waste.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.180]   And so I guess a simple test is,
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.660]   I look back at my six year relationship
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.860]   and the person listening can do the same.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.620]   Did your heart grow even by 1%?
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.500]   If it did, it's worth it.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.660]   Because growth of the heart
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.460]   is the hardest thing in the world.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.660]   You can grow your muscles, you can grow your net worth,
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.140]   you can grow your company,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.540]   but growing your heart is mission impossible sometimes.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.420]   And you need somebody to force you to grow it.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.660]   And my ex-girlfriend did that.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.460]   And for that, I'm forever thankful.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.180]   - So traveling exposes you to a lot of things.
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.620]   And I wanna go and pretend for a moment
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.380]   you have no followers.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.340]   No one knows who you are.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.260]   - No one knows I am.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.100]   - No one.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:00.940]   And you're traveling.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.780]   - Yes.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.620]   - And I wanna know,
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.660]   one of the things I think you're most well known for
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.100]   is building community
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.540]   and meeting people and connecting the world.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.260]   How would you go about doing that from scratch
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.260]   if you were in a new place, in a new culture, traveling?
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.420]   - I love traveling.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.100]   And I happen to have been not famous
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.460]   for like 27 years of my life, okay?
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.260]   So this is just a recent phenomenon,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.980]   like five years old, right?
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.500]   So I know how it's like to travel to like 30, 40 countries
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.980]   without nobody knowing me.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.900]   But I found out that the best way to travel
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.260]   is to go to hostels.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.740]   And I like strategically now,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.860]   when I didn't have money and when I had money,
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.700]   strategically would go to hostels
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.060]   and I would check in a hostel,
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.500]   ideally at a dorm, not at a private room,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.220]   because you wanna have like these random interactions
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.940]   with people that end up leading to friendships,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.300]   let's go explore together.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.100]   And then I would spend like a crazy amount of time
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.780]   in the lobby of the hostel
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.340]   in the hopes of just like randomly meeting somebody.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.220]   And then you just need that one person
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.300]   that's also in a very uncomfortable position, just like you.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.580]   And both of you decide,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.420]   hey, let's go explore this country together.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.060]   And when you have one person, it's easier to find the third
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.540]   and we have three, it's easy to find the fourth, right?
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.500]   So it's all about getting that one partner
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.340]   to wanna explore the country with you.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.180]   And so every country I went to,
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.380]   I would literally just go to the hostels
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.580]   to make the friends, not to stay at the hotel.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.740]   I don't care about staying in the hostels,
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.860]   just to make the friends.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.940]   - So you'd go to a hostel,
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.700]   potentially even book a room and not stay in it.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.460]   - Yes, I did that before.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.940]   - Because I imagine sometimes,
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.820]   if you were traveling with your partner, what would you do?
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.700]   - Oh, so the second tip is to not travel with your partner.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.540]   - Okay.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.540]   - Yeah, so when I started traveling,
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.620]   and I've never enjoyed traveling with a partner,
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.580]   if you are trying to make friends.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.060]   So the minute I became sort of self-sufficient in a way,
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.260]   like I started traveling with a partner,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.140]   but I find it actually really important to travel single.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:54.980]   - Okay.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.300]   - Is that, do you agree or disagree with that?
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.140]   - I think it depends.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.540]   My wife and I love to explore places together.
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.580]   So I have that kind of player two to go on these trips.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.300]   - But you're never gonna get player three.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.340]   - Sometimes.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.740]   - It's gonna be weird as a third wheel.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.780]   - Well, we went to South Africa
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.460]   and we wanted to explore by car and we were cheap.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.340]   And we were like, well, a car holds more than two people.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.180]   So what do we do?
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.300]   And we met these two Swedish guys
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.820]   and the four of us together bought a tent,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.540]   rented a car, bought four sleeping bags.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.220]   And we drove around for three weeks through Namibia
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.660]   and Botswana and Zambia and South Africa as a team of four.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.500]   Those two player twos, we didn't find the three,
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.260]   but we found the three and the four together.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.900]   But they were both single guys.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.300]   They were not in a relationship.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.580]   So we had a third and fourth wheel.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.660]   - Third and fourth wheel.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.180]   But that is significantly harder
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.100]   than if you were by yourself, correct?
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.980]   - But your strategy seems to be trying to engage with
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.980]   and meet people who are also traveling.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.700]   How do you try to engage and meet people local
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.220]   to the community and learn more about their culture?
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.080]   - Yeah, so I found that school networks
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.700]   were also very helpful.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.420]   So the Harvard alumni, so I graduated from Harvard
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.700]   and the alumni network is really global.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.540]   And Harvard people tend to stick together
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.020]   because they think they're better than others.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.540]   So I hope no one's listening to this.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.340]   But I try to check like local Harvard clubs.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.620]   And if I know a friend that is from that country,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.820]   like on Facebook, you know,
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.300]   remember the time of the social graph on Facebook
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.380]   where you could just search which one of my friends
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.700]   is now in Botswana or lives in Botswana.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.020]   And you'd get a couple of people
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.260]   in every one of these countries.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.300]   And that's really all you need.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.940]   It's all about getting the hook.
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.380]   The one person that will open the doors to you
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.260]   to meet the next 10 people.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.100]   That's how I think about it.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.100]   So I just find the hook in the first two days
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.680]   and then the hook takes care of everything else.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.780]   They find me the next 10 people.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.820]   - Do you ever find the hook
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.660]   just like at a bar, at a restaurant?
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.900]   'Cause I think that's what people assume.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.040]   They assume I'm gonna go to a bar
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.780]   and I'm gonna randomly talk to a stranger
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.220]   and now I'm gonna go on a--
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.360]   - That's how you find the hook up.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.200]   (laughing)
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.460]   Not the hook.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.740]   So I found it very difficult to meet people at a restaurant
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.780]   'cause you're sitting down the whole time.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.340]   How do you meet people at a restaurant?
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.900]   - Or a bar or like an event like that.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.940]   Maybe not a restaurant.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   Yeah, no, I had no success in this.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.780]   - Okay.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.660]   Is there something every time you go to a new country
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.980]   that you try to make sure you do?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.000]   - Yeah, well, it was by nature of my job
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.580]   but I try to make videos as much as possible
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.820]   of every person I go to.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.220]   Because I found that when you travel,
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.860]   like you're making so many memories
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.140]   but you'll forget these memories
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.620]   if you don't take videos of them.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.840]   For me, travel is a form of archiving.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.680]   Like literally I feel like
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.860]   I have my camera with me at all time.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.180]   Like, you know, like memorize, memorize, memorize, memorize
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.420]   'cause you wanna not forget this experience.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.380]   That's how I became a video maker and traveling video maker.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.300]   - How do you make sure you're not just living
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.160]   behind the camera when you're traveling?
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.740]   - I am living behind the camera when I'm traveling.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.580]   Who said I'm not?
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.060]   (laughing)
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.000]   Do you make content when you travel?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.860]   - Almost never.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.220]   - Almost never?
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.580]   - I make content about the travels.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.500]   So I'll go to a country,
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.860]   come back and talk about the experience.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.820]   - You're kidding.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.340]   - I mean, I made a video once in a country
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.060]   talking about how I got there.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.660]   But I don't know, I wanna like be there
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.100]   and I don't wanna be distracted
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.780]   from wandering around and seeing things,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.060]   thinking about, oh, well, I gotta go record this thing.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.660]   For me, that seems like it'd be overwhelming.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.980]   - Wow, that's interesting.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.540]   Well, I guess you and I travel differently.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.980]   We should try to travel together one day.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.520]   - I would like to see what that goes.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.160]   So I don't know how many countries you've been to,
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.040]   but it's a lot.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.880]   You've hit off countries
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.020]   that many people have never been to.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.620]   What are some places that you think
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.900]   people are just sleeping on that are really underrated?
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.340]   - So five days ago, I was in Greenland
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.860]   and I think it's a really place
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.740]   that a lot of people are sleeping on.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.740]   Nobody lives in Greenland.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.840]   Only 57,000 people live in Greenland
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.080]   and very few people visit it.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.920]   And the people that visit it
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.900]   are usually like the older population.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.660]   But I'd say Greenland is hard to get to
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.780]   and that's why a lot of people are sleeping on it.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.900]   But generally, I found that Asia
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.780]   is full of surprises,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.920]   probably more than Europe and Africa and Latin America.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.060]   I found Asia to be like much more full of energy
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.200]   and it has 60% of the world's humans, right?
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.220]   So it is the majority of the world.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.160]   So I become a big fan of Asia after traveling there.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.000]   I'd say Maldives,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.600]   not a whole lot of Americans went to the Maldives.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.480]   It's the only country I went to five times
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.780]   that go back to, five times,
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.620]   most countries I try not to go back to.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.740]   But the Maldives just has a special aura
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.040]   that I just feel like it's missing in American zeitgeist.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.720]   It's not there, why?
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.560]   - So the feedback I've heard
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   from everyone that's been to Maldives,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.160]   so I'm wondering if you did it differently,
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.720]   was like you basically land at a resort
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.920]   and you stay at the resort the whole time
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.080]   and then you leave.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.760]   - And what's better than that?
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.120]   - Is that the experience?
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.520]   I think you love connecting with locals
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.240]   and having these like amazing experiences.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.320]   I look at all your videos and the Maldives,
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.280]   I think it's like you just stay at an expensive hotel.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   That's it.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.440]   It seems like antithetical to the thing
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.300]   you would normally love doing.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.040]   - That's why when I go to countries with big populations,
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.680]   it's work and you're making videos, it's work.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.360]   But when I go to the Maldives, it's actual travel for me
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.120]   because there's no people to make videos about,
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.880]   there's no videos to make, you're just actually relaxing.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.920]   So maybe that's why, actually I never thought about that.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.280]   That's why I like the Maldives.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.760]   It is where I relax.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.240]   - So that's how I travel, I'm not making the videos.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.520]   You just need to go somewhere and not make a video.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.040]   - What's your goal when you travel?
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.760]   - Learning and eating new things.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.600]   - Learning and eating new things.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.100]   - So like meeting interesting people,
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.600]   hearing different perspectives, seeing different things,
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.720]   thinking about how those things came to be,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.280]   why things happened in a certain way.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.960]   - Have you been to Easter Island?
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.800]   - No.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.560]   - Okay, you should check it out, it's close.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.960]   Easter Island is like you can learn things,
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.560]   there's people there and it's like really remote,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   like the Maldives.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.520]   - Okay, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   Our version of the Maldives,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.960]   'cause I think you live in Dubai
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.040]   and I live in the Bay Area, is Bora Bora.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.200]   It's like eight hour flight, super easy,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   compared to the Maldives,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.560]   which is like literally maybe halfway around the world.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.960]   - And how often do you go to Bora Bora?
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.620]   - We went twice and it was super relaxing,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.640]   but it didn't really feel like travel in that.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.840]   There are some like local things that the hotel makes,
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.720]   but when we go to Thailand,
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.920]   it's like let's go to some back alley night market,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.720]   let's sit down on a stool and eat something delicious
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:59.160]   and meet random people and talk about what they're doing
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.620]   and then find out where that leads us
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.200]   and wander and explore.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   That doesn't happen.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.880]   Those are the most memorable experiences for me.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.720]   I love relaxing on a beach also.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.560]   To me, they're two totally different things.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.720]   - I guess it depends on how much you travel per year.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.920]   'Cause if you travel for three, four, five months a year,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.000]   which is how much I travel for work and for fun,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.120]   sometimes I wanna relax by doing that, the two weeks thing.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.160]   But most people have two weeks to travel,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.420]   so you wanna do as much crazy things as possible.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.800]   Drink at a bar in Thailand and go hopping
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.160]   in Taiwan or Japan.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.720]   So I understand why that is appealing as well.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.400]   I wish I could say I'm eating
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.420]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.200]   but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.080]   So I love having an easy way
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.200]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.760]   which is why I kickstart every day with AG1
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.480]   from Athletic Greens and I'm excited
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.360]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.880]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.640]   because I think it's the best option
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.520]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.240]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.960]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.240]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.680]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.840]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.920]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.420]   and energized for the day,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.920]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.680]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.720]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.520]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.600]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.440]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.920]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.800]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.440]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.120]   to take ownership over your health
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.100]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.560]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.240]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy,
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.920]   and even if you've already filed,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.400]   being proactive about this year
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.080]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.760]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.920]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.240]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.760]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.360]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.780]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.360]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.200]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.920]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.160]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.080]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.160]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.400]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.160]   open communication with your team
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.100]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.440]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.640]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.920]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.000]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.500]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.320]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.200]   so they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.080]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.680]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.560]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.020]   And as an AllTheHacks listener,

[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.700]   So let's rewind.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.540]   - Yes.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.660]   - I think one of the interesting things,
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.620]   for people who don't know your story,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.780]   there's a million podcasts they can go listen to
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.060]   to hear your story.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.420]   But the one aspect of it I wanna focus on
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.020]   that I think is relevant to a lot of people
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.520]   is taking a big bet on yourself.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.360]   - Yes.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.540]   - You quit a job that was, for many people, a dream job,
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.760]   and you bet on yourself.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.060]   And a lot of people do that by saying,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.440]   "I'm gonna start a little side hustle."
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.940]   I sometimes think in order to make something work,
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.480]   you kind of have to go all in on it and commit.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.740]   You could tell about the experience,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.800]   but how did you build up that conviction?
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.860]   And how did you find a way to make it even more affordable?
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.340]   You stretched your dollars way more
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.180]   than most people do when they quit.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.860]   - Yeah, and that's what people don't realize
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.740]   is that living in New York or SF
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.320]   is actually really dangerous.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.540]   Because now you are really enslaved
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.740]   to the daily life costs of living here.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.300]   And you're just talking about this,
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.900]   like you need a lot of money every month just to survive.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.740]   Can we talk about it?
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.380]   How much do you need per month to survive?
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.220]   - Me particularly?
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.540]   - You particularly, yeah.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.380]   - It's funny, 'cause my wife and I had this conversation,
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.780]   'cause now I'm a creator,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.340]   and the income of a creator is more variable, right?
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.260]   It could be very high, but also if the economy collapses
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.460]   and brands stop wanting to advertise,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.300]   it could go to zero.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.120]   - Yes.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.380]   - There's an amount of money in my mind
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.280]   that's like we could live on somewhere.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.580]   And then there's an amount of money that it's like
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.380]   we could keep living our current lifestyle.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.240]   And I think that number is like almost maybe two X.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.080]   - Wow.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.920]   - I think that if you didn't need to live in the Bay Area,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.760]   first off--
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.980]   - But it's in the tens of thousands.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.820]   - Yeah.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.660]   - It's not like $3,000.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.480]   - No.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.020]   - Which is crazy talk if you think about this.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.420]   Like if anybody listening to this,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.660]   you need tens of thousands of dollars
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.740]   to maintain a lifestyle here in San Francisco, right?
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.700]   Which means you will always need--
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.740]   - I wouldn't say that, I'd say it's maybe me,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.700]   but I would say when we were living in San Francisco,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.420]   before we had children,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:24.220]   I think our annual burn was under 10,000 a month for sure.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.060]   - Got it.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.500]   - But that's still high too for two people.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.020]   - For two people, definitely under 10.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.220]   - So my burn in New York,
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.700]   and this is why I decided to better myself,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.740]   my burn in New York was roughly $3,500 per month.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.700]   And my salary was roughly seven.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.460]   But that still was a little bit too high
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.460]   for my own comfort.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.580]   And I realized that if I just leave my job
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:46.020]   and use my savings and burn $1,000 in India or Ethiopia
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.900]   and learn and work on self-improving myself,
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.660]   I could extend my runway by two years,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.860]   three years, four years.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.820]   And so that's what I did.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.460]   I just left my life in New York
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.420]   and I went to Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya,
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.460]   and I started learning how to make videos
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.460]   and traveling by making videos and connecting with locals.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.420]   And the first two years, of course, it was self-sustained.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.580]   I was losing money, using my own savings,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.220]   but I was still saving money from,
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.980]   if I stayed living in New York,
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.380]   I would have spent more money.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.580]   So it made sense to travel.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.460]   Traveling for me was a way to save money.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.940]   And that's what people don't realize
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   is that traveling should be expensive.
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.020]   Actually, no, if you leave America,
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.980]   the world is shockingly cheap.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.780]   - If you leave your life for two weeks,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.460]   you don't save any money.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.340]   But if you leave your life for six months or 12 months--
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.180]   - You save a lot of money.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.020]   - You can save money.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.900]   In fact, when we left our life for eight months,
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.300]   we traveled around the world,
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.020]   we subletted our apartment, right?
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.260]   'Cause we couldn't get out of our lease,
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.620]   but we had all this furniture and we thought,
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.660]   "Oh, well, we could probably rent it
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.140]   for more than we're paying because it has furniture."
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.940]   And we almost broke even on the cost to travel.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.220]   So it's just traveling for free
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.700]   because we actually made that kind of major change.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.460]   - And you had all these point hacks and whatnot.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.300]   - Yeah, back then I didn't have as many,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.620]   but the number one way to burn money traveling
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.940]   is to fly on an airplane.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.740]   The marginal cost to add an extra week
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.700]   to a trip to Thailand is very low
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.140]   relative to the marginal cost
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.940]   to come back for another week later.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.420]   - Yeah, so the cost of a one-week trip
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.060]   versus a five-week trip.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.300]   - I wish I had a rule of thumb,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.620]   but I would say a five-week trip is probably cheaper
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.220]   than two one-week trips, is my guess.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.060]   Just because, at least for us,
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.220]   it's hard to find international flight
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.860]   for less than $1,000.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.500]   The way we were traveling at the time,
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.100]   it's very easy to find a place to stay for $10 a night.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.420]   You know, our budget was like under $30 a day.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.500]   Yes, points and miles make the flights cheaper,
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.660]   but there's no way, if you don't have points,
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.740]   to make the flight.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.740]   - Yeah, this is also an American problem
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.900]   because you're really surrounded by nothing.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.340]   Like San Francisco, if you wanna get to the next country,
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.380]   if it's not Mexico or Canada,
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.420]   you're looking at like seven hours.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.660]   That's like very far.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.020]   And if you live in, let's say, Dubai,
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.980]   you can reach, I think, 60% of the world
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.260]   within seven hours.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.140]   Did you know that?
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   So like a flight from Dubai to Pakistan is like cheap.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.500]   Pakistan to like say Thailand, cheap.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.260]   Like Thailand to Laos, cheap, right?
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.020]   So it's all these flights are so interconnected.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.460]   The world is much more closer to each other
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.220]   outside of the American continent.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.060]   - Yeah.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.420]   - It's just the North America and South American continents
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.180]   are just way too stretched vertically
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.900]   that it becomes really difficult to travel.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.400]   And that's why I find it hard to live here
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.780]   'cause you cannot travel in an efficient manner,
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.340]   financially and like time-wise.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.340]   - Well, I think you could play the points game.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.340]   (laughing)
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.580]   - Yes, that I don't know how to do.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.540]   - We gotta work on that.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.220]   - Just for context, I'm the kind of guy
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.420]   who has 20 t-shirts that look identical to each other
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.940]   in his entire wardrobe.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.060]   So I'm also like scared of like buying a different t-shirt
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.740]   because I don't wanna make the decision
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.720]   of which t-shirt to wear today.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.620]   I'm on a mission to streamline my life
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.580]   in a way that allows me to not think.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.420]   - Let's talk about that.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.240]   - Yes.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.500]   - What are other ways you do that?
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   - So it's same shoes, two pants, all the same color.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.880]   20 t-shirts, all the same designs,
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.500]   same everything, identical.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.100]   I have no material object
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.220]   that I have any emotional attachment to in my life
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.780]   other than my laptop.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.780]   And my laptop is replaceable because it's locked
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.620]   and it's all in the cloud.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.380]   So even if I lose my laptop, it's fine.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.900]   So if anybody gets into my house,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.060]   they can steal anything they want and I don't care.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.040]   I've never locked my house in three years.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.940]   My phone, I guess I have an emotional attachment
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.780]   to my phone.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.100]   So I'm only emotionally attached to my phone and my laptop
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.940]   and that's it.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.020]   - And some servers in the cloud
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.100]   that are holding all of your important--
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.220]   - All my important, yeah.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.460]   But nothing else in my life is important.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.300]   - Okay.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.580]   What about decisions around what to eat?
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.180]   - Oh, that I also streamlined.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.800]   So I'm vegetarian, which basically means 90% of food menus
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.020]   are not relevant to me
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.800]   'cause they're full of dead animals.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.940]   And I also try to eat like the same thing.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.220]   So I try to eat the same thing for breakfast,
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.500]   the same thing for dinner, same thing for lunch.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.420]   So eggs, it has like a lot of proteins and a salad.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.480]   Egg salad, egg salad, egg salad every single day.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.340]   So now I don't have to think about food.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.300]   What else?
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.140]   - Health, like exercise.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.100]   - Oh, health, yeah.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.000]   One hour per day, that's it.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.980]   Same exercise.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.900]   - What kind of exercise?
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.780]   - Oh, and also don't have to think about what I exercise
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.000]   'cause I have a personal trainer.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.840]   - Okay.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.660]   - So he comes and tells me,
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.860]   "Move your hand left, move your hand right."
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.900]   And I say, "Okay."
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.940]   And so now I've been able to save my brain capacity
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.220]   to focus on what really matters, right?
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.780]   Building a company, making videos, furthering my career.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.740]   And I don't do laundry.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.700]   I'm very, very lucky to not have to do laundry.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.100]   I never clean after myself.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.460]   I never cook.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.620]   I just don't wanna do things that are like maintenance jobs.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.940]   So maintenance job, eating is a maintenance job,
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:35.940]   but cooking is a maintenance job.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.900]   You eat today, you poop it in the next five hours, right?
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.780]   And then you have to do it again next five hours
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.900]   and again and again and again for the rest of your life.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.180]   So unless you derive joy from cooking, which I don't,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.900]   there's no point to cook.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   And there's no point to clean
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.320]   because it's gonna get dirty the next day.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.940]   So you need to be able to like find somebody
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.540]   to help you clean.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.700]   And this way I just don't do any maintenance work
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.100]   and also focus on just building,
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.740]   like growing on top of what I built yesterday.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.580]   - Okay.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.400]   - Does that make sense?
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.300]   - Does it sound conceited or rich people stuff?
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.220]   - I mean, I happen to know that you live in a country
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.580]   where having someone help you do laundry and cook or clean
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.140]   is significantly less expensive than it is in the States.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.380]   - Yeah, I still pay quite a lot.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.700]   I'm paying double the market rates.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.980]   I do believe in like fair wage, that's important.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.900]   But even here, you can get a helper in America
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.940]   for like two hours.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.820]   You can get food delivery.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.660]   Everybody gets food delivery.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.500]   I get food delivery.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.340]   I don't need somebody to cook for me.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.500]   It's something I did before I got rich as well.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.340]   And I never cleaned my room when I was poor.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.900]   When I was two, I never did it.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.740]   Are you kidding?
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.860]   Why would I?
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.940]   So yeah.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.320]   - Are there maintenance jobs that do bring you joy
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.900]   that you like to do?
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.740]   - No.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.180]   - How do you like to spend your time for fun?
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.620]   - What is fun?
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.460]   No, I'm joking.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.280]   Do you do maintenance?
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.120]   I'm actually more interested in you.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.420]   Do you do maintenance stuff?
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.860]   - Some things I like, for weird reasons, enjoy.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.680]   - Like what?
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.540]   - We have a hot tub.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.740]   You got to balance the chemicals on the hot tub.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.900]   And like, it's kind of fun.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.540]   I take my two and a half year old daughter.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.740]   We go scoop up a little water.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.620]   We put it in the thing and we see the chemicals
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.460]   and we measure it out.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.340]   - But that's a five minute job.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.460]   - Yeah, it's not that long.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.940]   But it's something that, oh, we got to do that this week.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.260]   Like we could hire someone to come to the house and do it.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.720]   I really struggle, and it sounds like you don't,
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.100]   with things where the mental burden
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.180]   or the overhead of thinking about it
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.860]   doesn't quite equate to the cost.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.820]   And so you don't factor it in as well.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.460]   So for someone to come to the house
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.940]   and put some chemicals in the hot tub,
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.520]   it takes five minutes, right?
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.280]   I'm sure the cost for that is gonna be more
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.220]   than like an average hourly wage times five over 60.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.180]   You know, like it's just gonna be much more expensive
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.500]   than that, I assume.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.660]   I've looked a little bit.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.900]   And so it's just hard for me to be like,
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.500]   I'm gonna pay someone $200 a month
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.740]   to come to my house for five minutes, three times.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.700]   - But you're not factoring your like brain cost.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.620]   - No, no, I think it's very hard for many people,
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.540]   myself included, to factor in that kind of like cost
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.500]   of doing all of these other things in life.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.780]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.900]   So if we add that hidden cost to what we do,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:02.140]   I think many people will not do what they do today.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.700]   Many people will stop cooking
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.540]   if they factor in the value of one hour
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.900]   of freedom outside of work in your 20s,
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.420]   when you could be building a startup
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:12.980]   or building a career or building a whatever
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.400]   or building a family, right?
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.220]   Now, again, big disclaimer is if you enjoy cooking,
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.060]   like it's amazing.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:18.980]   And if you don't enjoy cooking,
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.120]   then that's where the problem is.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.140]   - What do you encourage someone to do with that extra time?
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.300]   Not everyone knows I wanna start a company.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.820]   Are there things you think people should be spending
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.940]   more of their time on if it's not maintenance work?
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.220]   - So what's not maintenance work?
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.740]   I think that's a really important question.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.660]   What is not maintenance?
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.900]   So in life, maintenance is cleaning your car is maintenance,
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.380]   doing your bed is maintenance,
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.900]   cooking food is maintenance, right?
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.260]   To maintain your thing.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.620]   But what I think is not maintenance
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.460]   is building relationships, building family, right?
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.620]   'Cause if I invest today in my wife or my husband
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.820]   or whatever, in the future, it results in a nice family.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.380]   So I don't view that as maintenance.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.980]   I view that as building for the future,
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.780]   building a company, building a career
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.900]   and building your body, right?
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.300]   Like focusing on your fitness and physique, right?
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.360]   I think those are the four things I've identified
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.020]   as non-maintenance things.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.740]   And I'm happy to invest in them.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.580]   I invest a lot.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.980]   And because I'm single now, unfortunately,
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.260]   I invest a lot of my time into fitness
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.860]   and building my business.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.140]   I have two companies, so I'm building those.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.700]   So that's the only thing I view as non-maintenance work.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.780]   Everything else is maintenance.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.900]   - So there is one thing about travel
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   that I noticed that's interesting about you.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.020]   I have seen you travel to places like the Maldives.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.140]   You post all your travels online.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.420]   Anyone listening can see them.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.140]   And you would think someone successful like you,
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.720]   someone with money like you would travel in a certain way.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.260]   And even when you're traveling for work,
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.780]   you're still not staying at the Four Seasons.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.620]   And I'm curious, what is it about your style of travel,
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.020]   your belief about money?
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.780]   It seems like you don't think you have enough money
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.180]   and you're still in this like scarcity mindset.
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.660]   - Yeah, man, it's just listening to this,
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.900]   I get a little bit sad because I'm mentally poor.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.460]   There is a thing called mental poverty
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.780]   and I feel mentally poor,
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.420]   even though my bank account has millions of dollars.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.300]   But mentally, I feel poor and I don't know why.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.620]   Maybe because my formative childhood years,
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.100]   I spent obsessing over $2 here, $3 there,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.580]   saving $2 there, that I just don't see
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.620]   why I would wanna spend $200 extra
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.780]   for the same bed and the same roof,
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.500]   just because it's a Four Seasons.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.840]   So now I'm staying at a place called Axiom,
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.360]   which is like 100 meters away from the Four Seasons.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.220]   But it's like 250 bucks in San Francisco, not bad,
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.260]   as opposed to 500 bucks, so I'm saving a lot of money.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.700]   But I don't know, what do you do?
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.060]   'Cause we have similar net worth.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.460]   People don't know this, Chris,
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.580]   but you and I have the same amount of money,
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.140]   which is crazy 'cause I have 60 million
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.100]   more followers than you.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.180]   And I don't know why I couldn't monetize.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.260]   But how do you spend money at the Four Seasons?
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.860]   - So, this is why I like points, by the way.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.780]   - Oh my God.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.200]   - I'm just saying, I enjoy nice hotels.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.020]   It's so funny, I talk to people all the time
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.380]   to tell me how much they spend on vacation,
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.620]   and I'm like, wow, I could never spend that much money.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.720]   Like, you're gonna spend $1,000 a night on a hotel?
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.500]   That seems wild, like why would you do that?
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.080]   I don't get a ton of value out of some aspects of travel,
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.160]   and I do on others.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.700]   So if I was going to try to have some experience,
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.280]   I'd rather hire the right person
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.160]   to take me through the market,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.380]   to show me all the interesting things,
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.660]   who's a local who's been there and support that community,
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.560]   than to pay for a hotel that has nicer furnishings.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.620]   - Yes, because you like experiences.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.820]   - But staying at a hotel can be an experience.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.660]   - I could imagine spending more money for a hotel
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.260]   that gives you the experience that you describe
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.020]   in the Maldives, where you're over the water
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.580]   and you have a bunch of extra things.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.140]   But if I'm in San Francisco,
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.300]   I don't even know if I'd want to spend,
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.540]   I was in New York, and I was like,
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.200]   what is the absolute cheapest hotel I can stay at
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.340]   that isn't like two stars, just like horrible reviews?
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.860]   So I say to the Yotel, I don't recommend it.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.620]   I wouldn't ever tell anyone you should stay there,
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.380]   it was an amazing experience.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.980]   I got checked in at 11 p.m.,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.220]   and they're like, your room's not ready.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.340]   And I'm like, how is it not ready?
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.500]   It's 11 p.m., like this doesn't even make sense.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.100]   And they're like, oh, it might be a clerical error.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.140]   And then 20 minutes later, it was magically ready.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.740]   It looked like a room that they designed 10 years ago,
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.220]   and then have not repainted any of the things
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.060]   that have chipped off.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.220]   - That's crazy.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.340]   - And it was also $250 a night.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.700]   - Which is crazy expensive.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.920]   - Crazy expensive.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.380]   I've talked to a lot of people
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.460]   on this topic of mental poverty,
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.620]   and the idea that you ask anyone
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.140]   how much money they want to get to,
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.620]   and once they get there, they're never done.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.180]   They're always want more, they always want more,
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.020]   they always want more.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.940]   And then I've talked to a few people
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.100]   that have just completely disconnected from the concept,
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.880]   and they're like, I just don't care.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.140]   And I think in the last couple of years,
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.200]   I've kind of stopped caring about growing net worth.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.040]   Doesn't matter.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.860]   - Really?
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.700]   - Yeah.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.540]   And I had this conversation with my wife
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.860]   where we were talking about what our goals were,
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.600]   and she was like, I want to get to this net worth target.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.300]   And I was like, I don't.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.140]   She was like, really?
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:49.960]   You don't want to get there?
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.900]   And I was like, why do we want to have more money saved?
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.780]   Now, if we have more money, would we rather spend it?
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.900]   Would you rather give it away?
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.620]   Like, what things would we want to do with our money
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:00.180]   than just build up this like Scrooge McDuck pile of money?
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.660]   And I don't feel like I care about flying in a private jet.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.780]   If you think of like, if you could have unlimited money,
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.940]   what would you do?
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.460]   There's not that many different things.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.220]   I realized I speak from a place of privilege right now,
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.540]   but there's not that many more things
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.660]   that I think my money is worth doing anything
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.720]   that I don't enjoy doing to get.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.020]   And so if I didn't like doing this job,
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:20.860]   should I keep doing it?
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.940]   No, I should stop doing it.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.300]   Should my wife do her job if she doesn't like it?
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.940]   No, like we should stop doing the things
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.180]   because we're in a place that we can.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.720]   And I think I've been able to not care as much
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.340]   about money as I did.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.460]   - That actually means you're mentally rich.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.300]   That's what I'm hearing.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.260]   - Yeah, I used to feel mentally poor
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.660]   and I don't feel that way anymore.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.720]   - So the congratulations,
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.280]   you have defeated the poverty in your brain
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.080]   because the minute you stop caring about money
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.820]   or fearing about money, then you are mentally rich
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.780]   and you're living life the way life is supposed to be lived
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.300]   without worrying or thinking about money.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.100]   I'm still in the mental poverty side
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:57.300]   because I have a fear of losing it.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.440]   I have a fear that the next month it's gonna dry up.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.220]   I have a fear that I don't have enough
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.980]   and I have a fear that I'm still enslaved to it.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.500]   - Even though more than me
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.780]   and more than almost anyone listening
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.380]   knows how inexpensively you could live somewhere.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.220]   - Yes.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   - And you probably have enough that you could live
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.020]   in a place for the rest of your life
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.120]   and never think about it.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.360]   - So it depends what you wanna do with life, right?
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.160]   So one of my dreams is to start an airline.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.460]   I'd like to start a fucking airline, why not?
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:26.460]   And I wanna be able to come up with ideas
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.540]   and see them happen in real life.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.740]   For me, that's the ultimate freedom.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.300]   It's not to stay at the Four Seasons
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.020]   and it's not to like buy a Gucci bag
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.540]   and it's not to like fly in a private jet.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.300]   It's come up with ideas for projects
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.760]   and have enough money to see them happen.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.460]   So I'd like to put $10 million into funding a startup
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.300]   that does fake meat, you know, like cell-based meat.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.540]   I would like to try to buy one plane
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.760]   and see if we can come up with a different airline
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.300]   that's more fun and more human and more social.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.540]   Compete with Virgin Atlantic or whatever.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.420]   These are ideas I kinda don't wanna die
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.260]   without trying them.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.500]   I wanna try a hotel.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.680]   I wanna build a hotel.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.500]   Can I build a better hotel than the Four Seasons
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.780]   that's like really cool?
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.740]   So the reason I like money is it enables you
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.860]   to think crazy and do crazy and be crazy.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.660]   And I just love crazy.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.100]   So yes, I could live in a house for the rest of my life
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.740]   and not worry about money and just like, you know,
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.780]   live on top of a mountain.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.260]   But then I'll have so many ideas that I cannot execute on.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.700]   And that, for me, is sadness.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.640]   That is sadness.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.300]   So I still can't execute many of the ideas
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.940]   that I'd like to do 'cause they're simply too expensive.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.220]   - So your relationship is out there.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.700]   Your life's out there.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.700]   What's the end goal for you?
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.540]   Is it fame?
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.360]   Is it money?
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.420]   Is it building something?
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.380]   - So fame and money is not an end goal
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.740]   because people that look like me do not become famous.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.500]   So it's not something I think about.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   But the end goal is to build something out of nothing.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.340]   I think that is probably the sexiest thing in the world.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:57.340]   Create something of value out of nothing, out of thin air.
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.020]   The United States government creates money out of thin air.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.300]   Amazing, right?
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.940]   But what can you create out of thin air, right?
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.240]   You created kids.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.260]   That's amazing.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.420]   That's so magical.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.580]   You've created a company, a podcast.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.500]   I just feel like the act of going from zero to one
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.820]   is just better than sex.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.660]   And I wish everybody can experience that
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.320]   at some point in their life, the act of creation,
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.340]   of creating either a human or a project or a startup
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.260]   or a company or a piece of content.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.640]   And if somebody is not creating enough,
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.980]   maybe I'll end with that message.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.460]   It's like, try to do something from zero to one.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.340]   It'll probably be the most satisfying thing
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.420]   you do in your life.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.460]   - Do you have any advice for someone who's like,
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.180]   "I wanna be creative, but I don't know."
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.340]   How do they find the thing
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.020]   that they could go try to create?
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.060]   - Creative doesn't mean make videos and be artistic
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.340]   and make a song, right?
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.380]   Creative can be build an amazing family.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.380]   Creative can be build a company, build a house,
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.100]   a side hobby, build an ebook, whatever.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.660]   I think the word creator
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.580]   should not be just limited to you and me.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.540]   A creator is also a father and a mother.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:57.920]   And so--
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.600]   - And it doesn't have to be public, does it?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.440]   - No.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.640]   - Write a book, keep it for yourself.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.480]   - Keep it for yourself.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.440]   - It doesn't have to be something you publish.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.280]   - Yes.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.400]   - Seen something go from nothing to something.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.480]   - Yes, from nothing to something.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.160]   And this thing exists purely because of you
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.160]   and your efforts and your sheer determination and will.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.580]   And I just, I find that to be so sexy.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.480]   I don't know if other people relate to this message.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.720]   If they do, please message me.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.760]   Let me know at yassin@naas.io.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.280]   Y-A-S-S-I-N @naas.io, N-A-S.io.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.380]   But yeah, that's just a feeling that I've,
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.720]   well, over the last 31 years,
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.540]   it's the only feeling that's worth pursuing
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.340]   every single day for the rest of my life.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.180]   - I love it.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.200]   Well, we're here creating.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.240]   Hopefully people enjoy it.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.080]   I wanna hear stories.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.880]   If people are finding new things to create, send 'em in.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.920]   - And also, I did ask people
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.600]   to send you hate messages, right?
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.160]   - Yes, you got hate mail coming in.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.000]   - Yes.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:45.820]   - And whatever they're creating.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.660]   - Yes.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.720]   - Perfect.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.560]   - Let me know how it goes.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.400]   - Let's hear it.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.220]   Thanks for coming by.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.060]   - Thank you, thank you, Chris.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.120]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.920]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.440]   If you haven't already left a rating
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.840]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.560]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.000]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.380]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,

[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.440]   (electronic music)
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.860]   (electronic music fades)
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:24.600]   (birds chirping)
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:34.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
