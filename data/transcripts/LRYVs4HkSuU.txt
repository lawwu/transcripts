[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - All right, what do we got next?
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.880]   - All right, our next question,
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.760]   we got a question about the deep work buckets
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.480]   and then Keystone habits.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.840]   So let's take a listen.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.600]   - Hi Cal, it's Nevek here.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   I'm wondering if you could explain the difference
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.680]   between deep work and the roles that you play
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.920]   and your buckets and your Keystone habits in those.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.040]   I'm assuming you have other things you do in the buckets
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.720]   and I'm just not clear how you see the relationship
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.680]   between the buckets and your roles
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.160]   and I suppose deep work.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.040]   Thanks.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.240]   - All right, this is a good question
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.840]   because we can clarify the relationship
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360]   between the deep life,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.120]   the philosophy that includes the buckets and deep work,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.760]   which is a type of professional activity.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.280]   Jesse, let me ask you though, right off the bat,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.640]   I sort of stumbled into this terminology of buckets
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.200]   early in the pandemic when I was thinking
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920]   through the deep life and now we're kind of stuck with them.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.600]   You think this is a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.560]   - You've talked about the buckets for a while
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.320]   'cause I've been listening to your podcast
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.160]   since the very beginning.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.240]   I like the terminology and I remember you mentioning it
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.640]   even before I started working with you,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.720]   but I've always been a fan of the buckets.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600]   I use it when I explain it to certain people,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.360]   so I think it's fine, but.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.160]   - Yeah, all right, so we got what it is.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.920]   Buckets, we're stuck with buckets.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.240]   Let me do, by the way, let me do an update on the book
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.840]   and then I'll get to this answer.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   But I just finished my sixth version
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.100]   of the potential outline for this book.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.080]   I've gone through six versions, had a hard time with it.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.880]   This is the first version that I actually sent off
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.480]   to my literary agent and said, okay,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.700]   I think I have this thing cracked.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.600]   I think I might be ready to write a proposal.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.800]   So Jesse, let me do an update.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   Let me give you the latest update on the potential book
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.100]   I will be writing about the deep life
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.080]   and then we'll get to the meat,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   we'll get the meat of this question.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.440]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.540]   So here's what was struggling with me before.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.660]   I was struggling before when I was thinking about this book
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.660]   because it was important to me that for this subject matter,
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.800]   that the book was, for lack of a better word, smart.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   I didn't wanna tackle something as philosophically resonant
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.720]   as living a deep life.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.420]   I didn't wanna tackle it with,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.060]   and now here's the seven steps and here's bullet points
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.220]   and here's lazy writing, which in the nonfiction space,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.720]   the pragmatic nonfiction space,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.740]   you know you get lazy writing
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.820]   when a lot of rhetorical questions enter the scene.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.660]   That's a little tip when you get a lot of,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.180]   but would this really work?
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.940]   What about a duh, what about a buh?
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.300]   It's like, man, that's your notes
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.400]   for what you need to craft good writing about.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.900]   You can't just put the rhetorical questions
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.740]   into the writing.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.720]   So I thought this topic really needed,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.700]   it needed to be smart.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.260]   I mean, it's a complicated topic,
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.520]   but my issue was when all I was doing
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.400]   was trying to come up with a table of contents for the book,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.700]   I was putting all of the necessity to make the book smart
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.060]   onto the table of contents.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.800]   And so it was leading me down these unusual
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.680]   and contrived structures for the book
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.540]   because it's like, well, I want the structure itself
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.100]   to convey that this is something different.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.600]   And eventually what I realized was,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.060]   no, keep the structure simple
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.160]   and let the writing do the work.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.380]   And in fact, not only make it simple,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.740]   why don't we distill down to its essence,
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.580]   like the very elements of a Cal Newport book
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.000]   and simplify them down to its purest form
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.660]   so the structure is there and it's there,
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.740]   but in a minimalist form,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.380]   and then let your writing do all the work
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.100]   of showing the philosophical depth of this topic.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.300]   And so that's what I ended up doing
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   with my current outline in the prologue.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.900]   Like right up there in the prologue,
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.120]   it's me, it's early pandemic, this topic arise,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.660]   I coined the term buckets.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.740]   And I just let this one short prologue
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.560]   is gonna do all the work of just motivating
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.740]   why this topic matters.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.140]   It's been around forever, each, whatever,
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.600]   each generation comes at it differently.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.820]   We have our own moment where we're kind of re-appraising
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.220]   this topic, but no, like multiple chapters
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.180]   with citing 70 things,
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.220]   a prologue that is just grounded in a place and a time
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.260]   and me, boom, right?
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.540]   Then we go to a next chapter, prepare.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.300]   All of the stuff we've talked about,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.260]   I mean, the buckets, in general,
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.580]   what makes a deep life deep?
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.300]   I mean, I've pretty much simplified it in my own thinking
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.820]   that the definition of a deep life
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.820]   is you radically align, radically aligning your life
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.820]   to be in alignment with things that you really value.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.560]   So it's about not just aligning elements of your life,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.660]   but being willing to make radical changes to your life
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.940]   to align it to things that you value.
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.560]   I think just, let's just give the definition.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.820]   Let's talk about it.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.180]   Like, what's the hard thing about it?
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.660]   Well, it's hard to figure out what changes to make.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.260]   We have this bucket system we'll talk about in a second
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.460]   that can help, but like, there it is, just one chapter,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.020]   call it prepare, out of the way,
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   not dragging this out, not going whatever, just boom.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.060]   And then the whole rest of the book, I have five chapters.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.820]   Each is a different element of something
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.660]   you might radically align as part of building a deep life,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.420]   naming them with one word verbs
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.420]   and let the writing do the work.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.700]   So you have this prologue, you have this prepare chapter,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.180]   and then it's right now, the terminology I have is move,
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.180]   quit, serve, train, wonder, it's the current list.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.420]   And the list might change, but one word, one verb,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.300]   like I'm trying to get down to the essence.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.260]   Like let's get down to the essence of a Cal Newport book.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.500]   Here's the problem, here's the solution.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.140]   Let's look into how you implement the solution,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.160]   just getting it down to the essence.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.820]   And then I can let the writing do the work.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.780]   And I'm gonna follow my own journey through these chapters.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.460]   I'm a character in this, they're gonna be asymmetrical.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.620]   So it's not like every chapter
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.460]   has the same structure as every other one.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.900]   I really wanna get away from opening story,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.540]   interpretation of the opening story,
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.500]   complicating story, four bullet points.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.900]   It's gonna be, some chapters be different than others.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.540]   I'm a character in it,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.340]   let's be nuanced in tackling these issues.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.540]   Take these different elements of building a deep life
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.260]   and really go try to understand why do they resonate?
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.700]   What's at the core of them?
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.460]   What do you have to think about
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.220]   if you're trying to do an alignment here?
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.660]   Give some respect to the reader
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.340]   to help put the pieces together.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.220]   So that's where I am now, a very simple structure.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.420]   Now it then ends with an epilogue.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.160]   Okay, here's how I've changed my own life.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.220]   Very simple structure, one word chapter titles.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.780]   Get down to the core of it
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.860]   and then we'll really let a journey unfold,
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.840]   let the writing do what the writing needs to do.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.060]   I don't know, so what do you think, Jesse?
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.060]   Better or worse than where I was before?
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.860]   - I like it, so I have a question.
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.280]   When you were doing,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.600]   when you were trying to make the book seem smart
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.520]   and you were developing the table of contents,
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.300]   how did you explain that to the agent
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.460]   or whoever you submitted it to
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.260]   that it was the writing that was gonna be the smart work?
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.860]   Or did you write the epilogue as well
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.620]   so they had an example?
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.140]   - So yeah, it's a good question.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.980]   So what I was doing before
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.260]   is I was getting too cute with the structure.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.860]   Well, I think the last time I talked about on the podcast,
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.740]   maybe at that point I was doing paths,
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.100]   like here are the four main paths that people follow.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.460]   And that wasn't quite right.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.340]   I wanted to get to the crux of the matter,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.220]   like what are the actual changes
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.860]   that create the depth, the resonance?
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.220]   I wanted to be more concrete, so that seemed too complicated.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.780]   And then I had a form where each chapter was a setting.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.560]   So it was like, I'm at this farm,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.060]   I'm at this like writer's retreat or something like this.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.540]   And then I would build out from the setting.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.060]   But I was like, this is again,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.580]   it's not clear to the reader, why are we at this setting?
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.900]   And I don't want this to be
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.260]   just one of these reflection books
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.340]   where I just like, I have these kind of reflections
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.620]   and I prove that I'm smart with my writing.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.580]   And that seemed too cute.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.940]   And so really,
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.700]   and then I had more complicated traditional structures
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.020]   where here's like three, four chapters
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.420]   on like what's needed to prepare for the deep life.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.180]   And I was like spending all this time on it,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.740]   like that felt forced or whatever.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.380]   So I just simplified it down to these one word chapters
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.900]   and I sent it off just for my agent to look at.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.740]   But I was like, the structure should make a lot of sense.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.980]   Here's my standards, I've just simplified it.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.360]   But the writing is gonna do what the writing does.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.300]   It's gonna follow my story,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.620]   not every chapter is gonna be the same.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.740]   And it was more for me, I just felt a clarity.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.660]   And I felt like a book like this needed a lot of clarity.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.060]   Just you look at the table of contents,
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.300]   like I know what you're up to, let's get into it,
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   if that makes sense.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.540]   - Got it.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.580]   So this being the sixth version,
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.500]   how long is that process, like six months?
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.940]   Like you submit a version every month or is it?
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.580]   - So this is the first version I submitted.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.780]   So the first five versions, I was like, no.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.300]   So my whole thing, my whole process is
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.780]   I rely heavily on my sense of taste.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.620]   To borrow the terminology from Ira Glass,
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.260]   that like the first step
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.000]   in trying to produce something good
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.360]   is you have to develop the taste to recognize good things.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.260]   And it can be frustrating because then you know
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.880]   when you're doing stuff that's not hitting that level.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.780]   So I know what I'm looking for and I'm very empathetic.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.460]   So I put myself into the head of a potential reader
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.460]   and try to simulate what's that response?
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.100]   Is there an aspirational response or not?
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.180]   So I'm very empathetic.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.860]   I'm like this in person by the way too.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.660]   I very strongly read and feel empathetically
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.940]   what's going on in a room.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.120]   If I'm talking to someone, like every little nuance
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920]   about their state of mind and how they're feeling,
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.580]   it hits me really big.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.280]   And this has negatives and positives.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.920]   It has some social implications that aren't great
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.160]   but it's good for writing because I can simulate the mind
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.560]   of the reader really well.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.520]   And so I really began working on this in earnest in July,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.100]   just trying to get an outline.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.040]   And for the other five, I would finish it.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.000]   I would sit with it and it was just a feeling.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.320]   It's not right.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   It's hard to explain.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.720]   It's like a little premonition of like,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.200]   something's not right here.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.080]   There's some grit in the gears.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   And I would sit on it and I'd just say, this is not right.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.960]   And then I would try again.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.520]   And I think it's not quite right.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.180]   And I would try again, but it's not quite right.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.240]   So it's really, for me, it's all this intuition.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.880]   I just have an intuition when I finally feel
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.440]   like I think I'm honing in on something
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.080]   that the reader's it's gonna get.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.520]   It's all about pressing the buttons I wanna press.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.000]   I want the experience of reading the book
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.960]   to be exciting.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.760]   Like you have the sense of I'm gonna change something
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.960]   in my life and I'm getting some revelation
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.720]   and there's a whole sense that I'm going for.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.640]   And so I've been sitting with this one for a while
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.800]   and feel better about it.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.760]   So I think I'm getting closer.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.840]   - Were you influenced at all by your friend Ryan Holiday's
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.400]   new books with the one chapter titles
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   that he's been doing?
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   Did that influence at all with the one chapter?
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.000]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.960]   Yeah, so Ryan, I think Ryan is a great example of this,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   of keeping the form simple and clear.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.100]   And then letting the writing do the work
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.280]   of actually affecting the person.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.660]   Yeah, I think he's a great example of that.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.180]   If we're gonna be really highfaluting about this
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.080]   and self-important, as you know,
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.220]   I went through this phase of reading a lot about film,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.420]   film studies, et cetera.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.820]   And technically you could think about what I'm interested in
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.580]   is the pragmatic nonfiction equivalent
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.540]   of auteur theory in film.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.300]   So in film, when you look at Fellini and auteur theory,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.380]   there was this sense of like what the,
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.660]   especially in the 70s and 80s,
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.260]   that these auteur directors would take
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.500]   a well-established genre and then they would work
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.400]   within the constraints of that genre to create art.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.560]   And it was actually in the tension of their work
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.940]   against the constraints that you would subvert this
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.180]   or what they would do with this,
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.660]   that you would actually create the value
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.860]   that somehow that there was something to this
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.580]   that was even more special or magical
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.260]   than just starting with a blank slate.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260]   So this would be the difference between Ford
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260]   working within the constraints of the Western
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.920]   and visually and storytelling-wise working with it,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.820]   or Clint Eastwood in "Unforgiven,"
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.300]   which I recently re-watched,
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.620]   taking the constraints of the genre
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.840]   that he helped define earlier in his career
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.720]   and is in the subverting of the constraints
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.440]   that actually the power comes out.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.120]   And then comparing that, for example, to Terry Malick,
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.960]   who was just like,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.280]   "I'm gonna construct this thing from scratch.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   "This movie, it's gonna be whatever it's gonna be."
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.480]   The auteur theory, you work within the genre.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.280]   I think it's an incredibly self-important way
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.420]   of describing how-to books that I write,
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.920]   but at least it gives me some sort of motivation.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.160]   That, and Ryan does this too,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.240]   work within the constraints of the genre.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.000]   So I have a very clear constraint,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.840]   motivation, idea.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.300]   All right, so here's this issue.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.240]   Here's my original idea about what to do about it.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.220]   Digital minimalism, deep work,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.920]   replacing the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.400]   Then a journey to understand how to implement it,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.520]   which is where you help the reader
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   instantiate in their own mind
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.880]   how their life might actually change
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   to act on that promise.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   That's my Western movie or detective novel,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.160]   and I'm trying to work within it.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.520]   So that's what I'm doing with this new one.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   Let's just distill it down to one word, incredibly simple.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.120]   Get the motivation to a prologue.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.840]   Get the whole, here's the idea down to just one chapter.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.480]   Use all the new muscles I've been building
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.880]   at the New Yorker to be clear and well-crafted
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.920]   and balanced and momentum going,
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.440]   and then just see where it goes.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.800]   So this is the self-important stuff I tell myself.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   So I don't get bored.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.200]   I don't know, do you buy this?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.400]   This is probably going too far, right?
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.840]   Talking about auteur theory.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.920]   - No, I like it a lot.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.720]   In fact, if it becomes a movie,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.200]   we can get Andrew from the previous call to be a character
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.160]   and it's got all those other traits.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.360]   - Yeah, I left that, yeah, I did leave that out,
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.280]   that that's gonna be a big part of the book
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.800]   is gonna be these big call-out boxes,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.880]   and I'm gonna have a sketch of Andrew,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.160]   really dramatic sketch of Andrew,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.760]   and then a lot of details on rich data pipelines.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.800]   Because you gotta subvert expectations.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.600]   You're like, oh man, what's gonna happen?
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.840]   This guy's gonna quit his job,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.920]   and then it's XML formats for maximum data portability.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.440]   That's, I think that's where the magic's gonna be.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.960]   - No, I love the explanation.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.440]   I think it was great, so.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.160]   - There's an actual question lurking in there, wasn't there?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.600]   - Yeah, so the question was about deep work
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.520]   and working with the keystone habits.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.240]   You get this type of question a decent amount,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.160]   but I always love hearing the explanation
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.600]   'cause I'm a big firm believer
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.880]   that people need to be continually coached, so.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.840]   - Yeah, okay, so yeah.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   Now let's get back to the meat of it.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.560]   All right, so we have the deep life.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.840]   We have this growing definition of the deep life
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.420]   that I've been refining, where it's really about
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.040]   living your life in radical alignment
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.240]   with things you value.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.280]   So you're aligning to things you value.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.240]   You're willing to make radical changes
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.920]   to actually make that alignment,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.760]   maybe radical changes to where you live and work
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.920]   or the structure of your day.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.200]   Implicit in this definition is also
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.440]   you're comfortable missing out on other things
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.000]   to do this priority.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.800]   So I'm gonna really focus on a few things
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.600]   that really matter and radically align my life with it.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.840]   All right, so that's my vision of the deep life.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.320]   The hard part about the deep life,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.480]   and this is something I've been refining
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.320]   when I've been thinking about this potential book,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.240]   the hard part is, well, figuring out what that is.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.520]   Like what's really important?
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.920]   How do you align your life to it?
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.080]   There's some preparation that's actually required
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.400]   to get better in tune with yourself
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.640]   and to get more comfortable with the idea
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.340]   that you have efficacy, that you can actually influence
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.720]   the way your life unfolds.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.400]   A lot of us aren't really used to that
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.120]   except for in very minor ways,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.160]   like trying a new exercise routine.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.960]   And so the bucket system I talk about
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.680]   on the podcast a lot is in some sense
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.760]   a way of doing that preparation,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.960]   beginning to learn what's important to you,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.400]   beginning to build that muscle of aligning your life
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.840]   with the things that are important,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.280]   even if that requires sacrifices
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.760]   or deemphasizing other things.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.520]   It's the preparation stage.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.200]   And then once you're done with that preparation stage,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.000]   then you might actually make some more radical steps.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.760]   Now I'm ready to like with confidence,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.800]   move across the country, go to the farm,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.560]   radically change our work situation,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.120]   whatever it's gonna be.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   So I see now the buckets as a preparatory step
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.100]   towards a more extreme push towards a deep life.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.720]   The idea briefly is you identify
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.920]   the important areas of your life.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.640]   I call these the deep life buckets.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.440]   The examples I give often are alliterative
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.880]   and I'll start with C.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.640]   So the original group I used to talk about
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.120]   was craft, community, constitution, and contemplation,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.920]   but people have different lists
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.160]   of what's important to them.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.920]   And what I would recommend in this system
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.000]   is that you start, step one,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   identifying a keystone habit for each of these buckets,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.120]   something you do on a daily basis
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.200]   and track that you actually did it
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.960]   that's not trivial, but is also tractable.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.880]   So it's not, you know, I clap my hands twice,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.360]   but it's also not, I ran a half marathon every day.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.480]   These keystone habits should be something
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.200]   that advances something you care about in that bucket.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.480]   The idea here is not that this will radically transform
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.640]   your life, but that you begin to get used to this idea
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.920]   of I intentionally prioritize each of these things.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.760]   Each of these things gets attention.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.120]   So that's step one.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.080]   Step two, then I recommend taking each of these buckets
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.800]   in turn and giving it four, six, maybe eight weeks.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.760]   So I usually say average out four to six weeks
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.960]   where you focus just on that area of your life
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.560]   and overhaul it.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.840]   Like what more permanent changes do I wanna make?
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.000]   What things do I wanna eliminate?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.120]   What new things do I wanna do?
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.760]   What more permanent changes do I wanna make
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.000]   to make sure that that part of my life
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.720]   is getting a good amount of attention
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.320]   that I'm extracting from it a good amount of value
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.160]   in my day-to-day life?
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.000]   And that takes some time and experimentation.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.960]   So that's why I say take at least four to six weeks
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.300]   for each.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.880]   This is a concept that I stole
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.520]   from the medieval Jewish practice of Musar, M-U-S-S-A-R,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.320]   which is a practice of virtue cultivation
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.800]   where you actually focus one month at a time
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.840]   on different virtues that you're trying to improve
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.080]   and then you cycle back again, very into that idea.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.000]   I think it's a really cool idea
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.680]   that should be known more widely.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.080]   So I'm sort of pulling from there.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.280]   And then when you're done with those overhauls,
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.120]   you are gonna be in a state now
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.600]   where you know what's important to you
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.680]   because you have been experimenting with it
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.920]   and trying to amplify things
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.280]   and just getting in touch with those intimations
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   for each of the areas of your life.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.840]   You've just spent a month thinking nothing about that.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.200]   And you feel a lot more efficacious
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.460]   because you've now done non-trivial rewiring
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.160]   of elements of your life to make sure
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.240]   that each of these buckets is being satisfied.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.320]   That by itself is gonna put you
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.000]   on a much more stable foundation.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.040]   If you did nothing else,
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.480]   I think your life is gonna be deeper.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.720]   It also puts you into the right place
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.760]   if you wanna make the radical changes
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.360]   'cause now you really know what you're all about
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.640]   and you're confident you can make changes.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.160]   So that's the deep life bucket system.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.240]   Deep work, by contrast,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.340]   is a particular type of professional effort.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.600]   It is when you're working on something
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.080]   that is cognitively demanding and you don't context switch.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.720]   So you give it your full attention.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.740]   Much more minor in the grand scheme of things.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.560]   So where might that show up in here?
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.940]   Well, the craft, what I call the craft bucket
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.220]   is the bucket that's dedicated
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.740]   to what you produce professionally.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.080]   It also, by the way, can cover other things you produce
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.680]   that maybe is not at the core of your job,
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.180]   but any type of producing of things that are valuable.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.920]   If you're the actor, Nick Offerman, for example,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.820]   from "Parks and Recreation,"
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.300]   he has this fantastic woodshed warehouse
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.340]   in the suburb of Los Angeles somewhere
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.780]   where he builds these great wood creations.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.180]   It's not a business for him, but it's craft
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.020]   and that's important to him.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.860]   So it's building things,
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.580]   but definitely your professional life is covered there.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.460]   When you're considering craft, deep work matters.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.980]   Because as we talk about,
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.300]   you wanna produce things of value.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.140]   That means you wanna make sure
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.820]   that you have good time protected for deep work.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.860]   And you wanna work on the load of work in your life,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.300]   probably so that you have enough ratio
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.140]   of deep to shallow work.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.380]   Yeah, that's all considerations
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.700]   that apply narrowly when you're trying
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.940]   to figure out your craft bucket.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.860]   So to get to the definitive answer
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.860]   to the original question,
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.980]   the deep life is this big idea.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.060]   If you're going through my preparatory
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.380]   deep life bucket system,
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.660]   during the time you're focused on a craft
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.860]   or whatever your equivalent is of the craft bucket,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.500]   that's where you'll care about deep work.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.540]   And I like to make this point
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.940]   because I think deep work as a concept
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.180]   has inflated for some people
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.020]   to cover a lot of things.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.500]   And I'm trying to keep these separations more clear.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.460]   So this is why I like to talk about,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.980]   let's get deep work narrow to what it is,
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.500]   focusing on something hard without distraction.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.940]   And let's use the term deep life
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.180]   to capture this broader goal of living a life
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.940]   that's radically aligned with your values.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.460]   All right, so I don't know, do you think,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.460]   I think Jesse asked probably the breaking,
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.140]   I'm breaking records here for length of answers
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.420]   before we actually get to any information
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.860]   relevant to the original question.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.700]   - That was a good one.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.020]   That one was 21 minutes probably, pretty close.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   - Oh dear Lord.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.700]   - It was solid.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.540]   - All right, all right.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.180]   You know what, I'm going fast.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.020]   I'm going fast.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.420]   This is my challenge.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.580]   Fast answer on this next one.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.420]   Be ready for it.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.060]   (upbeat music)
