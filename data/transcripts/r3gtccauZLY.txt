[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.260]   Men fixate a lot on someone's past because they feel that another man can permanently
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.140]   taint a woman.
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.240]   You don't have that power.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.780]   You don't think that some women are damaged?
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.780]   A man cannot permanently taint me.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.700]   A lot of women are very ... they've had relationships that have completely changed their personalities,
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.240]   the way they trust a man, the way they view men in general.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240]   I feel like you can be in a messed up relationship that can really mess you up.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.760]   But I feel like when it comes to past and a man focusing on what happened five years
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.140]   ago or what man you slept with or what guy you were with, that is thinking, when this
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.280]   man stuck his penis in her, she no longer has value.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400]   We're the whores, but who are we all?
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.120]   But the truth of the matter is, it's like, if you meet somebody that makes sense, whether
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.000]   they have a kid, whether they've been with someone publicly, why miss out on potential
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.260]   love of your life just because some guy dated her and it didn't work out?
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.760]   That's probably the mature mindset.
