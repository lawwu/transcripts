[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.200]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.980]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.340]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.380]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.080]   Today is Wednesday, April 5, 2023.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.480]   Today on the show, I want to discuss
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.520]   the potential for the U.S. dollar
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.720]   to lose its status as the world's reserve currency.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.320]   There have been various news articles
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.120]   and various chatter that I have been observing
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.100]   online that seems to be, as best I can tell,
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.660]   seems to be sparked in this most recent iteration
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.640]   by a recent announcement from the nations of China
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.980]   and Brazil that evidently they're going to do
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.540]   some form of trade deal in their own currencies.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.080]   And people are taking this and extrapolating out from it.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.320]   I'll cover that more in just a moment.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.260]   Now, the short version is quite simply
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.360]   that I don't think this is really anything new.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.560]   I have been paying attention to finance for,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.660]   I guess call it 15 to 20 years now.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.660]   And in that period of time, I have consumed hundreds,
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.700]   perhaps hundreds of careful articles
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.680]   analyzing and predicting the doom of the U.S. dollar.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.840]   And during my entire lifetime,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   those articles have all come to naught.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.180]   Now, that doesn't obviously mean
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.560]   that they couldn't actually come to something.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   But today I want to try to present a series of arguments
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   as to why it's unlikely to come to be a problem.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.760]   So the outline of the show,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.940]   the TLDL, too long, didn't listen, is quite simply this.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.840]   I'm not particularly concerned about the U.S. dollar
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   losing its status as the world reserve currency.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.140]   I'm less concerned about this idea today
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.040]   than I was four or five years ago,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   primarily due to my own personal experience.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.480]   I'm gonna present some arguments
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.280]   as to why the U.S. dollar is going to continue
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.880]   to be the world's reserve currency for a good long time.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   But then I'm gonna share with you
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.920]   towards the back half of the show,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.300]   how to hedge your bets and how to be protected
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.320]   in case I am wrong.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.440]   So let's just read a couple of headlines here
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.040]   to set the stage.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.360]   I went onto Google News,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.940]   I searched dollar to try to find some bricks.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.440]   I searched for bricks, currency, et cetera.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.240]   Most, this doesn't seem to be a particularly
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.320]   mainstream thing.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.680]   There's not a lot being talked about
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   in any kind of large mainstream newspapers.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.080]   Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.200]   Washington Post, et cetera, not a big feature.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.720]   Now we can find a few articles,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.320]   for example, here's one on Schiff Gold,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.120]   Peter Schiff's company,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.480]   headline, "Bricks Nations Developing 'New Currency'
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.240]   as Quest for Global Dedolorization Accelerates."
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.120]   First couple of paragraphs,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   "China and Brazil recently finalized a trade deal
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.160]   in their own currencies,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   completely bypassing the dollar,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.120]   but that's not the only bad news
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.980]   for the world's reserve currency.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.760]   Last week, a Russian official announced
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.640]   that the bricks nations are working to develop a,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.160]   quote, 'new currency,'
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.100]   yet another sign that dollar dominance is waning.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.800]   State Duma, the Russian Legislative Assembly,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.160]   Deputy Chairman Alexander Babakov,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.480]   said the transition to settlements in national currencies
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   is the first step.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   We've already seen this occur with recent oil deals
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.440]   between India and Russia being settled in currencies
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.360]   other than dollars, et cetera.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   The articles go on.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.360]   If we, here's a DW article, Deutsche Welle from Germany,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080]   business, Brazil, March 27 is the date,
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   "A new world order?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.200]   Bricks nations offer alternative to the West.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.640]   Predictions about the bricks countries
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.040]   as the fastest growing economies haven't quite panned out.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.840]   Instead, the alliance is now offering a diplomatic forum
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   and development financing
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.120]   outside of the Western mainstream."
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.080]   It talks a little bit about the currency
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.640]   and challenging the World Bank model, et cetera.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.440]   Here's a website that's called First Post.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.720]   It seems to be an Indian website.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.320]   I haven't dug into it deeply,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000]   but it seems to be an Indian news site of some kind.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.160]   Headline, "Dumping the dollar.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.840]   Will a new bricks currency
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.200]   replace the US currency for trade?
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.860]   The bricks collective comprising Brazil, Russia, India,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.400]   China, and South America is working on a common currency
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   in an attempt to ditch the US dollar
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.840]   and push back against America's dominance.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.880]   The move comes as Moscow and Beijing
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.760]   call for de-dollarization in the face of Western sanctions."
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.400]   There are others, but you get the idea.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now, the question is, how do you,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   there are always news headlines.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   And if you're new to this,
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   if you are super passionate about this,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.840]   I wanna caution you that you need some perspective.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   And so I'm not quite yet an OG in the finance space,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.680]   but I'll probably be there pretty soon.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   And I have observed a significant change,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   in my thinking over the years,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.120]   as I have been involved in this space.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.080]   When I was younger, I would take these articles
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.520]   and these news, I'd freak out,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.600]   consider that they're certain, et cetera.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.120]   And today I'm filled with a whole long list of questions
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.960]   to try to understand what is,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   you know, to try to understand what to do
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   and how to judge the veracity of headlines.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.600]   Remember that newspaper headlines are basically propaganda.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.240]   And so it's easy to announce that you are,
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.400]   it's easy to announce that you're exploring a new currency
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.880]   for the BRICS nations.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.480]   That's wonderful, and that's a great propaganda effort.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.600]   To actually create and implement a currency,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.800]   that's another thing.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.480]   It's like, it's easy for a 20-year-old guy
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.720]   to announce that he's exploring for a supermodel wife,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.800]   but to actually bring it to fruition
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.440]   is a very different thing.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   And if you look at the old guys in the finance space,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.880]   what I observe, people who are seasoned
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.240]   or experienced investors, what I observe is,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.960]   it's not that they discount the possibility of,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.360]   say, for example, the US dollar
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.200]   losing its World Reserve currency status.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.360]   They don't discount the possibility.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.800]   Of course it's possible.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.920]   But that they put it into perspective to say,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.200]   all right, what's gonna replace it and how and why?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   For example, here was Nassim Taleb's tweet today.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.320]   He says, "You will only start worrying
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.420]   "about the dollar status as a reserve currency
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.260]   "when you see long lines outside the Brazilian,
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.200]   "Russian, Iranian, and Chinese consulates
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   "full of young professionals seeking immigration visas."
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.680]   And it's a pretty fair argument,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.880]   meaning seeking immigration visas
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.980]   to go from the United States to those nations.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.800]   Now, having stood in multiple immigration lines
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   to leave the United States and go to some of these places,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.200]   I look at it and I realize that,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.760]   hey, there are people who are doing it.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.860]   But my years being outside of the United States
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.880]   have come to cause me to actually appreciate
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.720]   the United States, the US dollar, more than ever before.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.180]   And so I say to you, as someone who, again,
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.120]   at one point was very concerned
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.960]   about the collapse of the US dollar,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.080]   I don't like that word, I'm using it for dramatic effect,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.240]   but paid a lot of attention to these kinds of arguments.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.040]   Today, I look at the world from a different perspective,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   having lived outside the United States,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.940]   and I want most of my money in dollars.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.780]   Not all of it, which we'll get to in the second half,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.160]   but I want most of my money in dollars.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.280]   Now, some months ago, about three months ago,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.000]   I happened to listen to a presentation,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.080]   a video, a YouTube video, by Peter Zaihan
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.440]   called "Global Currency, The Dollar Ain't Going Nowhere."
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.960]   Now, Zaihan is someone who I have mentioned repeatedly
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   in past months, listener of the show turned me on to him.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.880]   My first book of his that I read
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.760]   was his most recent one called "The End of the World
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.340]   As We Know It As Just the Beginning."
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.720]   I found it quite powerful and persuasive,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.600]   and I appreciated him presenting a series of clear arguments
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.240]   that I was able to factor into my own thinking.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   Because he's clear on his reasons and his arguments,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.040]   it gives me good data to think about.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.200]   Since that time, I have gone back
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.660]   and finished all of his previous books.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.600]   In fact, just yesterday, I finished reading
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.500]   the last of his books that I had not previously read.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.360]   And I don't think that's necessary, by the way,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.200]   for most people.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.740]   I like to do it 'cause I like to understand
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.080]   where someone's coming from.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.440]   I like to understand where someone has been right and wrong
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.760]   and try to understand what someone's perspective is.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.260]   And I think I now have a pretty good understanding
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.600]   of what his particular opinions are.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.040]   But I thought that, as I've spoken with people in real life
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.440]   about their concerns about the collapse of the dollar,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   et cetera, I have found myself turning several times
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.000]   to this video that he created.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.460]   It's eight minutes long and his discussion of the subject.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.380]   And I think it's a powerful discussion
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.860]   because he gives good arguments that we need to consider.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.300]   So I'm gonna begin today,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   not by talking about all those Zaihan books,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.060]   but actually one more comment.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.820]   I would say that one of the things that's interesting,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.220]   his predictions over the last,
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.960]   I think it was about eight years of writing,
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.860]   that I have consumed of his, are fairly consistent.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.620]   Many of them have come true, not all of them.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.560]   But his method and his model that he has presented
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.460]   is clear and straightforward
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.520]   and is a very useful mental model to consider.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.660]   Now, we're not gonna dig into all of the depths
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.140]   of that stuff.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.260]   I'm not gonna put four books into this show.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.420]   I'm saying that I respect his analysis
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.580]   and his ability to quickly and clearly present arguments.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.260]   Let's begin the video here by Peter Zaihan.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.820]   - Zaihan here coming to you from Colorado
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.380]   where eight inches of snow turned into 16 to 18
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.300]   because you know, mountains.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.020]   Now, today I wanted to talk to you about global currencies.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.860]   Every few months to couple of years,
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.580]   a new conventional wisdom takes hold
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.540]   that the United States is in its final years,
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.540]   if not final months,
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.700]   and some big political thing is gonna happen
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.900]   that is gonna dethrone the US dollar as the global currency
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.620]   and all American power will unwind with that.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.900]   There is no part of that logic chain
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.420]   that has ever been correct,
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.140]   but these stories keep persisting
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.140]   because there is no shortage of people out there
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.740]   in the world who are anti-American and can't do math
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.060]   and have no sense of history.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.300]   So here we are one more time.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.460]   Now, let's begin right there.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.220]   This is what I have observed over my years
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.060]   of being involved in finance.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.980]   And I've watched a lot of people get sucked into this.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.940]   Remember that when you want to sell,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.700]   sell an idea, sell a product, et cetera,
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.580]   one of the triggers that you can push
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.540]   is the trigger of fear.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.300]   Fear is a very powerful motivator.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.520]   And when you have the ability to push on fear,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.860]   you can cause people to take action.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.740]   And so in the space where you get in,
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.140]   so if you want to sell something,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.060]   if you can create fear, the fear can often,
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.220]   and urgency, then that can often cause people
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.460]   to take action to try to buy your product.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.420]   Now, there's an element of which this can be healthy.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.840]   There are things, for example,
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.560]   that we try to put fear into people.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.380]   I try to put fear into my children of cars.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.260]   I want them, if they see a car moving around them
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.300]   and they hear motor,
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.100]   I want a motor that's on,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.700]   or they see a driver who's in the car,
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.380]   I want them to be afraid of the car
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.940]   and turn and run away so they don't get run over.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.220]   And of course, there are many versions of that
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.100]   where we want to properly instill a fear,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.940]   or if you don't like that word, a respect for it.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.380]   But we also don't want to be manipulated by fear.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.020]   And this is a space in which we are constantly
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.380]   subject to people trying to manipulate us with fear,
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.220]   and especially in the financial markets.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.520]   Where is this most prominent?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.340]   Well, clearly, the sale of things like gold,
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.680]   silver, gold coins, silver coins,
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.620]   a lot of it is pushed by fear.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.580]   Bitcoin, right?
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.180]   Use Bitcoin because the dollar
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.080]   is gonna lose its world reserve status.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.340]   A significant amount of this is both fear and greed
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.340]   put together, which is a powerful combination.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.400]   The reason I say greed is everyone's hoping
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.980]   that their Bitcoin that they buy today
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.300]   becomes a hundred bagger,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.380]   increases by 100X and they're super rich.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.740]   Just like the same thing with gold coins.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.800]   If the US dollar falls apart and it collapses,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.920]   my gold coins are gonna be worth 100X.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.080]   And I had over the years, people tell me,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.800]   you know, my little stash of silver
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.080]   is gonna be able to buy me five houses
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.280]   and I'm gonna be rich in the new economy.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.520]   I think that it's fatally flawed,
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.480]   but this is just an expression of greed and fear.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.720]   And you put these two together
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.840]   and people commit tons of irrational deeds.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.920]   Even in the, I see this a lot
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.880]   in the internationalization space.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.180]   And again, I'm sort of involved in these markets.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.760]   I talk about these topics,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.320]   but a lot of it is played up on fear.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.240]   Leave the United States
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.340]   'cause the United States is gonna turn
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.360]   into a nightmare place
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.600]   and it's just gonna be hell on earth
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.640]   and it's better everywhere else
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.440]   'cause the US dollar is gonna lose
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.480]   its status as the world's reserve currency.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   And as Zaihan says here,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.760]   he says it's never been true and it's not true.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.180]   And he's gonna present his arguments as to why.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.960]   I also believe that it has not been true.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.040]   It is not true.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.480]   And it is not likely to be true in the medium term,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.540]   as long at or at least as far out as we can see.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.860]   Not the same possible.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.280]   I insure against it.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.840]   Notice I said insure, not plan for it.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.260]   I insure against it, but I think it's improbable.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   So let's get into some specific arguments here.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.220]   - Step one, US power is not a result
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.060]   of its position as the global currency.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.900]   It's the other way around.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.040]   The global currency has to be able to impose by force,
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.560]   if necessary, some sort of packs on the trading system
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.620]   to allow trade to happen in the first place.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.020]   And right now the US Navy is more powerful
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.700]   than that of all other navies combined
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.300]   by about a factor of seven.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.420]   And if you consider that the world's second
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.060]   and third most powerful expeditionary navies
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.740]   are the Japanese fleet and the British fleet,
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.900]   and you throw them in as American
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.700]   for this force projection factor,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.100]   you're now talking in excess of 12 to one.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.140]   So honestly, there's never been any math there.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.900]   And there's no danger to the US position
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.540]   from a strategic point of view.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.500]   - All right, let's deal with that argument.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.660]   - California's top casino and entertainment destination
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.260]   is now your California to Vegas connection.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.660]   Play at Yamava Resort and Casino at San Manuel
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.900]   to earn points, rewards, and complimentary experiences
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.140]   for the iconic Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.340]   Two destinations, one loyalty card.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.960]   Visit yamava.com/palms to discover more.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.280]   - First argument, the US dollar is not the source
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.280]   of American strength.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.400]   Rather, the US dollar is the reserve currency
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.520]   because of American strength.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.120]   And the simplest way to define strength
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   as is using a military calculation as Zaihan does.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.400]   Many people believe that if the United States dollar
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.440]   lost its status as the world reserve currency,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.800]   then the power of the United States
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.720]   would plummet on a world stage
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.960]   and that the entire country and economy would implode.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.120]   And one thing I am very persuaded of by reading it
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.640]   a bazillion times in Zaihan's book
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.480]   is that that is not true.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.280]   The United States is one of the least involved countries
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.240]   in the world in terms of international trade.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   The United States doesn't really trade.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.360]   It doesn't need to, doesn't want to.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.160]   Basically, if you buy Zaihan's analysis,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.000]   and again, backed up with facts and figures,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.920]   you can look at the United States specifically,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   North America in a focused way,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.620]   and the Western Hemisphere of all of the Americas
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.360]   as basically just a region that sits off by itself
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.240]   and doesn't really much care what happens
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.600]   in the rest of the world.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.640]   That is not the case for many other nations in the world.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.920]   And so this is one of the things
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.680]   that makes the United States hard to predict.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   Basically, the United States has enabled internationalization
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.380]   over many decades now,
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.440]   but the United States has not really ever been involved
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.700]   in internationalization.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.600]   Basically, all the United States does
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.320]   is purchase the goods from around the world,
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.240]   which has helped other nations to build their economies
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.620]   and become strong and wealthy and powerful,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.360]   but the United States has never really gotten that involved
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.720]   in international trade.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.240]   This is, to me, one of the things that I missed
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.640]   for a long number of years,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.980]   and I'm very grateful for my reading of all these books
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.760]   to put it into perspective.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.120]   I misunderstood how isolated
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.120]   and self-sufficient the United States is as a country.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.200]   And it's really, really fascinating to think about
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.880]   and recognize where I missed it.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.760]   One of the biggest things that I missed
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.640]   was even what happened in the shale revolution.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.720]   Now, I knew the United States had become energy independent
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.480]   and was now an energy exporter,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.880]   but I didn't understand
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.360]   the great fundamental transformation.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.920]   And this has been one of the huge keys
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.460]   to the transformation of the US system
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.600]   and even involvement in global affairs over the last decade.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.440]   The United States has always been extraordinarily independent
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.700]   in terms of its ability to function as a nation
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.320]   due to its basic geography,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.480]   wonderful, abundant farmland,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.940]   great natural borders that protect it,
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.480]   surrounded by close allies,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.520]   a great manufacturing tradition,
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   great intellectual property tradition, et cetera.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.120]   The United States is basically,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.480]   if you cut the United States off
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.960]   from the rest of the world today, 100%,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.360]   the country would be fine.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.780]   There would certainly be a recession.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.920]   There would be hard times as companies go bankrupt, et cetera,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.160]   but there's nothing fundamentally that couldn't be done.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.320]   The country within its borders could make everything.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.800]   It has all the resources.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.160]   There would be some missing rare earth elements
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.760]   and whatnot for lithium batteries.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.080]   There are things that the country imports,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.220]   but generally speaking, the country would be fine.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.420]   The biggest thing it was missing for a long time
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.220]   was abundant energy as US oil flows diminished over time,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.260]   and that was where the United States was involved
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.060]   for a time in securing its oil flows.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.460]   But since the shale revolution,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.260]   the United States now has more energy
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.300]   than it needs for its own consumption.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.860]   And one of the things that Zeihan is prone to point out
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.540]   is if you bring together North America
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.200]   and include Canada and Mexico,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   you have an incredibly powerful three-country conglomerate
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.420]   that has everything in abundance,
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.980]   abundant energy, abundant workers, et cetera.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.040]   It can basically cut itself off.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.860]   So the United States doesn't derive its value from,
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.860]   excuse me, the US dollar does not derive its value
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.400]   from the fact that it is the world's reserve currency.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.840]   Rather, it is the world's reserve currency
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.300]   because of the nation.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.780]   Now, here's my example to try to make this more evident.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.500]   If you go into, if you say,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.580]   "Okay, I want an alternative to the US dollar,"
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.780]   and you're looking around for a competing currency,
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.080]   there are a handful of options that you can look at.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.980]   Of course, there are many countries around the world
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.640]   that have currencies, hundreds of them,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.300]   and you could go and you could participate
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.940]   in those countries' currencies.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.040]   But there are a few that will generally float to the top.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   Now, in terms of big ones that people would know,
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.960]   you might have a currency like the euro.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.320]   That's not often a super popular alternative to the dollar.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.920]   A lot, not very many people come and say,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.760]   "I wanna take my money and put it in
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.320]   "from dollars into euros."
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.700]   And there are a few reasons for that
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.800]   because many of the issues that plague the dollar
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.460]   have plagued, affect the euro worse.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.040]   But there are a few that people are often common to.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   And one of them is,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   there are a few that people often really want
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.960]   that they mention.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.520]   And one of those is the Swiss franc.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.180]   I want you to think about what that represents.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.680]   On an international stage,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.380]   the reputation that the Swiss franc has
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.380]   is that of being a currency of a nation that is isolated,
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.160]   that is relatively independent,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.480]   that is neutral,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.680]   and that has a strong basic core to its economy.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.400]   That's the idea, that's the perception that exists.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.560]   True or not, doesn't matter.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.040]   That's the perception that exists.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   And I think the Swiss franc is fine
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   in terms of as an alternative for some of your money.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.640]   That's fine.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.080]   But when you think about the Swiss franc,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.640]   everything that is true about the Swiss franc
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.200]   in terms of the nation of Switzerland
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.540]   is true on a scale of 100 to the United States generally.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.360]   And that would be, I think,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.000]   an important point to start with.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   The dollar is valuable because of the nation itself
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.040]   that is basically an isolated, independent,
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.520]   self-sustaining, autonomous nation
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.040]   that has everything it needs
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.680]   and has a huge economy that's just built around it.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.880]   When you add in the military power argument
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.820]   and the fact that the US military is the military
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.200]   that has the ability to control everything militarily
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   in the world, then it becomes much more powerful.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.760]   And that military component,
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.320]   while probably none of us love it,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.480]   I don't love it myself as an American,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.680]   I don't love what the US has done,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.360]   I can see that sometimes good, sometimes bad,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.040]   sometimes positive, sometimes negative, it's a mixed bag.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.160]   But the truthfulness of it,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.880]   since it is true that the United States is so,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.000]   as Zahin said, is seven times bigger,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.840]   the US Navy is seven times bigger
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.520]   than all the other navies of the world combined,
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.120]   you can see the level of military dominance.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.160]   And when you get into the world of money,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.040]   you want your money to be from somebody
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.360]   who is militarily powerful and militarily dominant.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.660]   Let's continue the analysis.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.820]   From an economic point of view,
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.600]   the idea is that people, countries will just stop using it.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.840]   And the scuttlebutt of the moment
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.000]   is that a number of countries are negotiating,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.080]   or at least talking about publicly,
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.360]   joining the BRICS group.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.320]   Now, BRICS is a group of four large developing economies,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.400]   Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.780]   It's a grouping that was put together
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.800]   by some finance guy back in the 2000s,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.520]   and all he meant by it was,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.160]   "Hey, look, these are four big countries
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.260]   "with big bond markets,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.600]   "we might wanna consider trading these as a group."
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.280]   That's all he's ever thought about it.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.640]   But the leader of the BRICS countries
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.600]   do get together from time to time to shop.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.540]   No meaningful policy has ever come out of it
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.920]   because these countries don't really trade.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.480]   I mean, they all trade with China, of course,
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.740]   but they don't trade with one another.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.880]   So there's a reason to caucus with Beijing,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.560]   but the rest of it is just kind of fluff, always has been.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.120]   And so when I see stories about other countries
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.480]   such as South Africa or Argentina,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.880]   or now Saudi Arabia, starting to join, I'm like,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.920]   "Oh, this is really boring,"
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.220]   because these countries really have nothing in common.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.680]   But anyway, as the conspiratorial logic goes,
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.080]   if they stop using the US dollar, then the US is doomed.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.000]   Well, they'd have to start using something else.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.880]   And none of them, none of them
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.560]   want to use each other's currencies
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.120]   because that would give that country a leg up.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.400]   - So let's stop there.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.160]   Recognize, if you're not gonna use the US dollar,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.720]   what is the alternative?
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.560]   If you're not gonna use the US dollar,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.640]   what is your alternative?
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.880]   On a personal level, before we go to the country level
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.480]   where Zaihan is going, on a personal level,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.520]   think about that right now.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.240]   If you're not gonna use the US dollar,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.120]   what is your alternative?
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.960]   If you're worried about the US dollar
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.280]   and you're not currently using an alternative,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.360]   I don't believe that you're actually worried about it
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   because any alternative that you think
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.200]   could replace the US dollar in the longterm
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.240]   is an alternative that you should be using today.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.200]   If you believe that the Chinese yuan
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.160]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.040]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.920]   then you should have a bank account
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.680]   in which you transact and you save money in yuan.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.160]   If you believe that Bitcoin is going to replace the US dollar
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.280]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.040]   then your money should be not only stored in Bitcoin,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.720]   but transacted in Bitcoin.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.740]   And while this is increasingly possible,
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.440]   for many years now, this has been the Achilles heel
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.840]   of the Bitcoin movement,
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.800]   is can we actually transact in Bitcoin?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.600]   Are we transacting directly in Bitcoin for Bitcoin exchanges
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.160]   without going through the US dollar
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   as an intermediary in our exchanges?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.180]   If you believe that gold is going to replace the US dollar,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.320]   then are you not only saving in gold,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   but are you transacting in gold?
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.000]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   If you believe that the world's reserve currency
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   is going to replace the US dollar
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   then you should have a bank account in Bitcoin.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   This is interesting to me because this is where my family history is from.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   It's a great story, wonderful story.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   You should read it to your children.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   It's called Little Britches Series by Ralph Moody.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Father and I were ranchers.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   In this story, written decades and decades ago,
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   Moody talks about this time
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   in which there wasn't enough money available.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   He describes how one year there was plenty of money
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   and all the farmers and ranchers were working for each other.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   They would go and help each other bale hay and stack hay.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   They would get paid in money and there was money circulating the economy.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   But then something happened, and this was about 1905,
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   and there wasn't any money available.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   He describes, without it being a focus of the story,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   he just describes in the terms of narrative
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   how difficult that period was when there wasn't money available.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   There wasn't money available for trade.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   It wasn't available.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   They couldn't interact with each other.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   So what they wound up doing is his family
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   wound up actually being quite well off
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   Comparatively speaking,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   previously they had been simply subsistence farmers
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   and other people were richer than them
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   because other people were working for money.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   Well, his family became wealthier
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   because they didn't have any money, but they did have stuff.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   But they were interacting with one another
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   and they had to use IOUs, so men would come and work for them
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   and he would have IOUs for their hay and their hay crop, etc.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   He describes it as being a very difficult time
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   and a lot of people were wiped out.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   And so it's interesting because this ties to something
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   that I have thought about for years.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   When I was younger, I was very attracted to the idea
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   of having a gold-backed currency.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   That always seemed like a great idea.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   Of course you would want something,
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   you want money that's backed by something solid.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   You want currency that's backed by something that is real,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   that is available.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   But what I didn't understand,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   and I still have a hard time articulating clearly
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   in a teaching way,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   is to why the concept of a gold-backed currency
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   was dropped in the first place.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   And if you can't defend this, if you can't say it clearly,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   then I think you have a hard time describing it.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   Now, you can take the conspiratorial view.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   Well, we wanted to drop the gold-backed currency
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   so that the government could spend money without limits.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Okay, I'm open to that, but I find it hard to believe
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   in just the hardcore conspiracy view of anything.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   I find it hard to believe that it just doesn't jive
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   with my experience of human nature.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   There may be always ulterior motives, etc., hidden motives.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   We all have that.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   But the hardcore conspiratorial perspective
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   seems hard for me to justify.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   So what were the problems with a gold-backed currency?
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   And how were those problems alleviated
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   or intended to be alleviated by a fiat currency
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   that has no fundamental backing?
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   And this sense of lubrication is one of those issues.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   Now, to point out what Zahan says is it's not just
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   that you need a currency that has a size of trillions of dollars
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   in our current number, but rather you need something
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   that has that as excess in order to lubricate global trade.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   So understand clearly that the scale of currency
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   that is necessary to do global business,
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   global transactions, etc., you need a huge amount of it.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   And that doesn't mean that your currency
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   has to be in the tens of trillions.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   That means you have to be able to lubricate
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   the exchange of tens of trillions.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   Your currency needs to be even bigger,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   which gets us to probably the single biggest constraint
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   on being a global currency.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   You have to not care what happens to the value
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   of your currency in any given day.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   Because if there's a trade surge and demand of your currency
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   goes up, then all of a sudden supply of your currency
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   has plummeted and you're dealing with very real
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   economic distortions at home.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   This is, I think, a very important point
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   that we need to talk about.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   Because there's a huge difference here
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   between the American perspective and the global perspective.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   And this is something I appreciate very deeply
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   now having lived outside of the United States for four years.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   Americans don't think about foreign exchanges
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   in any meaningful way.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   They don't pay much attention to it.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Yes, it's an academic idea that you read an article
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   in a financial publication about the strengthening
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   of the dollar or the weakening of the dollar.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   But that makes no fundamental difference
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   to the average American on a daily life.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Because Americans earn in dollars,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   they bank in dollars, they spend in dollars, etc.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   And yes, there is inflation.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   We all know that since its inception,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   the dollar has lost 97% of its value.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   We understand that.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   But at this point in time, inflation is well
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   baked into the cake.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   It's just understood and assumed by all of us
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   that our currency is going to inflate.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   And so the average American doesn't care
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   what the value of his currency is on a global stage.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   But if you go to almost any other country,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   everybody except the very poor understands
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   what is happening in terms of exchange rates.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   Talk to your average Canadian,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   your average Canadian is going to have a pretty decent idea
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   of the general range of the exchange rate
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   between Canadian dollar and US dollar.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   Talk to your average Mexican,
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   they're going to have, again, not the very poor,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   but most international, kind of middle class and up people
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   are going to have some connection of what
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   the current value is of the Mexican dollar
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   to the US dollar.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   And on and on it goes.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.240]   And so this is, so the United States,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.240]   you have to have, so what Zayhan's argument here is,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   you have to have a currency where nobody even cares.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   And it's very hard, and that's one of the things
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   that the United States government
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.240]   and the Federal Reserve has been able to do.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   They can manipulate the value,
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   or they can allow the value to fluctuate massively,
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   and nobody really cares.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   And the people don't care, and the government doesn't care,
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   and the Federal Reserve doesn't care.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   That's his point.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   And that's very different.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.240]   And to be clear, that stems from, at its core,
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   the relative isolation and independence
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   of the United States.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   A nation that derives a lot of its income
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   from trading with the United States
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   would never have that degree of flexibility
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   that the Americans themselves have.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   - The value of your currency in any given day,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   because if there's a trade surge
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   and demand of your currency goes up,
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   then all of a sudden supply of your currency is plummeted
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.240]   and you're dealing with very real
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   economic distortions at home.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   So your currency has to be so huge
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   that you don't care that global exchange in it
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   is moving around every day.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   And that means you also need to be able
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   to run a persistent trade deficit,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   because you have to be able to provide currency
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   for everyone who wants to trade everywhere at any time,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   and you cannot sign off on each individual transaction.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   That makes the list down to one already,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   because the Europeans couldn't do it
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   because they have to run a trade surplus
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   because their demographics are so aged
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   they will never be net importers again.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   It can't be the Chinese.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   The Chinese are the most manipulated currency
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   in human history.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   They print two to five times as much currency every month
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   as the US Fed did at the height
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   of our monetization programs in 2007 to 2008,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   and then again during COVID.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   Everything that everyone says is wrong with the US dollar
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   is actually wrong with the Yuan by a factor of 10 more.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   And every time the Chinese start to loosen up
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   their capital controls in an attempt to have
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   a bigger role for their currency internationally,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   a half a trillion to a trillion dollars of private savings
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   floods out of the countries in a matter of months,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   and they have to slam that window shut again.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   So, there is no reason to expect the US dollar to go anywhere.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   In fact, let me put this in historical terms.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   The need to have a large, liquid, stable currency
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   maintained by a country that doesn't care
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   what happens to it every day is so huge,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   so central to trade, that even at the height
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   of the British-Spanish confrontations
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   in the late colonial period, the Brits were using
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.240]   almost exclusively Spanish currency to lubricate
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   their slaves' rum-finished goods trade triangle
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   between the Caribbean colonies, the American colonies,
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   and the British mainland.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   I want you to take special note of that comment.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   Again, the comment is, hey, there's a war going on
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   between the Spanish and the Brits,
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   and yet still the Brits are using the Spanish currency
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   in order to lubricate trade.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   Money is so integral to our system,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   that if we don't have enough money,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   then everything collapses, and you will use
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   the money of your biggest competitor.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   This is one of the things that you see all around the world.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   You go to whoever the biggest enemy of the United States is,
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   in ideological terms, be it, I don't know,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   maybe Russia right now, or China, or Venezuela,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   or Cuba, etc.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.240]   But I haven't traveled in all those nations,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   but in every one of those nations,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   the U.S. dollar is incredibly valued by most people.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   In some cases, especially those in Latin America,
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   it is the de facto currency that is used,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   even by those who are an ideological enemy.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   [music]

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   Brits were using almost exclusively
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   Spanish currency to lubricate their
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   slaves' rum-finished goods trade triangle
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   between the Caribbean colonies, the American colonies,
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   and the British mainland.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   Another good example.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   At the height of the Vietnam War,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   the Vietnamese were using the U.S. dollar
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   in their international exchange because there was no option.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   You want a more recent example, look at what's going on with Russia.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   The Russians are under financial constraints right now,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   sanctions put on them by the Americans, the Europeans, and others.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   And so they tried to pull a lot of their petroleum earnings,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   which comes in in euros and dollars,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   and they tried to push it into Chinese yuan
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   as kind of a stick it to the West.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   Well, a few months later, they tried to then pull it out,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   and the Chinese were like, "Well, no, we really don't want these yuan back."
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   And so the Russians just lost tens of billions of dollars.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.240]   There is simply no example at any point through human history
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   of the unit of exchange for global trade
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   of anything other than the global hegemon
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   and the largest economy writ large.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   It's just not possible.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Now, on this point, recognize this applies today
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.240]   in your own practical experience.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   There is one currency that you can spend
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   in any country in the world today.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   That currency is the U.S. dollar.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   And I have proven this myself in every country I have been to.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   There is one currency, and that is the U.S. dollar.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   When I travel, although I will often carry some money
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   from a regional currency, which I'll get to in a moment,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   I always carry U.S. dollars,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.240]   and I always carry U.S. dollars in small denominations.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   And there have been various times where I have settled bills.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   You go to a restaurant, you don't--
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   if for whatever reason you're not using a card
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   or the card doesn't work or whatever,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   then I'll pay in U.S. dollars.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   Now, I will usually often--
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   in some cases, they'll just accept it directly--
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   but in many cases, I'll just give a slight premium for it.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   Hey, the bill would come out to $4 or $8 in exchange.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.240]   I'll just pay $10.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   And if you bump up the exchange a little bit,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   the merchant is often very happy just to receive dollars.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   The point is that on a very real level,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   you can go around the world with one currency,
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   and you can pay with U.S. dollars.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   Until that changes, I don't see--
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   and that's the reason I'm talking in these terms.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   I'm not talking about settling international petroleum purchases.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.240]   I'm talking about you and me with the scale that we can see with our eyes.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   Until that changes and the U.S. dollar is not desired
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   by ordinary people, ordinary shopkeepers
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   in any country in the world or in most countries of the world,
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   is not in question.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   Now, there are, of course, regional currencies.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   And so, for example, the euro is a powerful regional currency.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   You can take a euro, and you can spend it.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.240]   It'll be accepted in many places around Europe,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.240]   even if the euro is not the standard currency.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   You can spend euros in a casual way in Switzerland or in Sweden
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:05.240]   or in Turkey, et cetera, because you're close enough to it.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   But the euro is not accepted in Latin America or in Asia
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   the way that the dollar is.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   And so what I'm trying to do is give you just a very simple idea
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   to back up Zahin's claim, which is on a big international space,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   with what you and I can see with our own eyes.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   Point through human history of the unit of exchange for global trade
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   being that of anything other than the global hegemon
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   and the largest economy writ large.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   It's just not possible.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   I don't mean that to sound pro-American,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   because the Americans have been on the other side of this.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.240]   During the War of 1812, when the Brits were very close
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   to destroying the United States as a country,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.240]   our unit of exchange internally was the British pound.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   And if anything, as the world continues to deglobalize,
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   you should expect the American position to entrench,
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   because as global trade breaks down and goes into regional trade,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   you're going to have a series of regional hegemons
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   who have tried to impose a bit of a PAX on their own neighborhood,
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   and they will try to force everyone in their neighborhood
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   to use that currency.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   But all of those countries will have a vested interest in not doing that.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   And as long as the US dollar is available,
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   you've got a more liquid, less politically problematic currency
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   that doesn't swing wildly, that is not actively manipulated
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   to achieve trade advantages, and that is going to be used instead.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.240]   So, I mean, for example, think about the Eastern Mediterranean.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   We're nearing a world where Turkey is going to be the central hub
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   for all things in the Caucasus and the Middle East
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   and the Eastern Med and the Balkans.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   They're going to try to get everyone to use the lira,
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   but not everyone is going to want to use it
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   because the Turks will, will, will use that authority
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   in order to bind all these other economies more closely to them.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   Anyway, like I said at the very beginning,
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   there's no shortage of people who don't like Americans,
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   who have no sense of math or history,
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:52.240]   who are always going to trot this up every few months.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   And it means as little today as it did then.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   All right, that's it for me. Until next time.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   So there's the extent of Zaihan's video.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   I'll link to that in the comments if you want to see it.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   He is a world-class master at taking his background information
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   and putting it into a short daily video.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   His YouTube channel is called Zaihan on Geopolitics.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   Wonderful, wonderful source of news.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   I don't have a ton to add, other than to say,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   show me the alternative. Show me the alternative.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.240]   And while I won't be sad for there to be alternatives,
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   one of the opinions that I still hold,
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   that kind of comes from the Austrian perspective on money,
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   or on economics, is that currencies should compete with one another.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.240]   That anyone can create any currency they want for any reason
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   and let them compete with one another.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   And in a limited way, I think that's what you see right now.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   You see that countries and currencies can compete with one another.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   But on that basis, there's not really, on an international competition front,
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   there's not really any alternative to the US dollar.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   What is the alternative?
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   We'll know that there is an alternative when we see it being used,
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.240]   and when we see the growth.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   Until then, I think any predictions of the US dollar's long-term,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   losing its status as the world's reserve currency,
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   are wildly overplayed.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   And they usually come from countries who are seeking to gain a propaganda edge
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   by proliferating their message, or by companies or individuals
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   who are seeking to sell something out of fear and greed,
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.240]   trying to simulate people's fear and greed.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   As best I can see, the US dollar isn't going anywhere,
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   and there's just no viable competitor at the moment to the US dollar.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:56.240]   Now, does that mean you should do nothing and you should ignore this completely?
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   I would say no, definitely not.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.240]   And here are a few things that I think you should do.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   Number one, while it may be true, you might accept it as true, as I do,
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   that the US dollar is the world's reserve currency
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   and it's going to continue to be the world's reserve currency,
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.240]   but that doesn't mean that it's that way forever.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   And so there may be value in owning other currencies.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   Now, this is generally most obvious if you have some connection to another place.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   So, the Turkish lira has been greatly inflated recently.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   And so you wouldn't naturally go and say--
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   by the way, this is one of Zayhan's predictions--
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.240]   that Turkey is an up-and-coming superpower, a regional superpower, for various reasons.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   I think he's probably right.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   But that doesn't automatically mean that you would go and invest all of your money
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   into the Turkish lira if you don't have any connection to Turkey.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   But on the other hand, if you do have a connection to Turkey in some way,
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   then, of course, some of your assets would be exposed to that.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   And whether that is Turkish banking deposits, Turkish investments,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   Turkish real estate, etc., you are going to pay more attention
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   if you have a connection to that corner of the world.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   So if there is another currency that is represented to something
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   that you have a connection with, then obviously consider pursuing it.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   It could be Canadian dollar, it could be euro, it could be Turkish lira,
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   it could be Colombian peso, whatever it is.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   If you have a connection to a place, then obviously exposing some of your money
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   and your investment structure to a local currency is going to be helpful.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.240]   What you need to know, though, is quite simply this.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   The majority of the wealthy people in that country are trying to do
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   the opposite of what you're doing.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   They want to have just enough money in the Turkish lira in order for them
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   to grease the necessary financial accounts for their business,
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   their investments, etc., and they want to have exposure to long-term appreciation,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   but they want the bulk of their money denominated in dollars
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   to protect their money.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   So if you're in the United States and 100% of your money is in dollars,
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   recognize that most of the world is sitting and looking at you with envy
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   about how you get to enjoy this highly stable currency
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   backed by this incredible titanic power, etc.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   So I think it's wise for you to consider diversifying some of your money,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:30.240]   but recognize that it's probably of a lower priority for you
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   than if you're Lebanese and you're trying to figure out how to protect your money.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:39.240]   The path at this point in time is fairly obvious for most people
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   that the U.S. dollar is the preferred alternative,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:48.240]   and that's not due to--again, that's due to what the United States represents,
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.240]   not due to them forcing it on the world.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   Are there good alternatives to it? Absolutely.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   I think that it's perfectly reasonable for you to bank in other currencies
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.240]   and to have exposure to other currencies.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   So whether you keep accounts in Singapore, in the Singapore dollar,
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   or again, Switzerland in the Swiss franc, or in Great Britain with the pound,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   really any number of these are okay,
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.240]   even if they're rather smaller currencies, right?
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.240]   The Swedish kroner or something like that,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   where, okay, there's a relatively small currency, but it has some independence,
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   that can be a great move for protecting some of your money.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   Just like owning some gold coins that you keep in your safe
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.240]   or in your safety deposit box or in storage in another country,
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   this is a great insurance play.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   But don't think that that's not appropriate for all of your money.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   If you have a million U.S. dollars and you're actively involved in business
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   and you just say, "I'm going to go put all this money into gold coins
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   held in offshore cold storage somewhere," that would be a really bad move.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.240]   And I think the same thing, especially when we come to other potentially global options.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   So many people want to get out of a regional option.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   They say, "What's a global option?"
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   Well, in a digital world, maybe there's a digital alternative.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   This is the argument in favor of bitcoins,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   the argument some people put in favor of other cryptocurrencies.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   And while these things have been beaten up massively,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.240]   there is probably an increasing relevance for these in the future
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   because we are living in a world--
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   So think about where we've come from.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   There was a day and age in which the British were running their empire
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   with the Spanish doubloon being the currency of exchange.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.240]   That's the reason why, incidentally, we have what's called the Treasure Coast
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.240]   in South Florida, where I'm from.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   The Treasure Coast is called this because of all of the Spanish shipwrecks,
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.240]   all the shipwrecks, where the boats were full of gold.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:51.240]   All the gold and the gold coins going all around is what made these spectacular shipwrecks.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.240]   So there was a day in which they literally had to transact in gold coins.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   Then you had the development of paper currencies,
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.240]   and you had various IOUs that became paper notes.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   And then those notes at one point were connected to,
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   anchored to some sort of limiting factor.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   So if you had a $20 bill, but that was redeemable for gold upon presentation,
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   then that was disconnected.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.240]   So this money was traded on a global basis.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   And then it was paper money.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   So you had pallets of bills going around the world.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   And while there are still pallets of bills moving around the world--
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   I forget the numbers, but I think it's probably half of all U.S. currency
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   is outside of the United States--
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   but now it's just digits on a screen.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   It's just a form of accounting of digits on a screen.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   So I don't deny that we could invent beautiful new digital systems of accounting.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   That's possible.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   I just simply deny that they're currently a significant factor in global trade
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   or in most people's personal lives.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   But if the marketing efforts continue and people continue to believe in them
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   and they start to use them over time, who knows?
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Five years from now, 15 years from now,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   they could be more and more of a factor in our lives.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   We don't know.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.240]   And so having exposure to those is smart.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   Please, and I have a course, right?
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   By the way, there haven't been enough of you going and getting that.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   So if you haven't gotten my Bitcoin course,
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   go to BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.240]   Learn how to buy Bitcoin completely anonymously.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   Learn how to own it.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.240]   Learn how to use it, etc., without any ties to your names.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   It's a fabulous, fabulous tool.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   But don't put all your money in Bitcoin, please.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   The U.S. dollar is a better bet for most of your money.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   Make your moves, but don't put all your money into Bitcoin.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   The next point of protection that you need to take
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   is simply pay attention to owning assets, not currencies.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   Virtually none of us should sit around
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   and have all of our money in currency.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   You should own assets.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   And those assets can be bought or sold in various currencies.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   This is, of course, what we're trained to do.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   By learning how to avoid inflation, excessive inflation,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   we wind up purchasing assets, and that's right.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   Assets are companies, pieces of real estate,
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.240]   collector watches, bonds, stock options, various things.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   These are all assets.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   And while they may be denominated in dollars,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.240]   though that can be changed in many cases,
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   and it doesn't have to be denominated in dollars.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   If you own a house right now, free and clear,
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   no mortgage, etc., you own a house.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   Today, you can sell your house for Bitcoin.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   Today, you can sell your house for gold coins.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.240]   Today, you can sell your house for Swiss francs.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   Now, if the US dollar is going to lose its status
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.240]   as the world's reserve currency,
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   then you should find it increasingly easy
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   for you to get a fair price for your house
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   if it's denominated in an alternative currency.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   When we see that your house and your neighbor's houses
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   and it's a regular thing that housing transactions
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:15.240]   are being denominated in something other than dollars,
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.240]   that'll be a pretty good sign that the end of the US dollar
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   is the world's reserve currency is approaching.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   But until then, be skeptical.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   Now, this is also true on an international basis.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   I have been in many countries around the world
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:37.240]   where the local currency is not the normal pricing of houses.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   Now, this is not true in countries that have a strong currency.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   If you go to Great Britain, you will find that the houses are--
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   everything is priced in pounds.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   But I've seen a lot--you see this in Latin America,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   you see this in places that face significant inflation.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   I've seen a lot in Turkey where even officially,
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   today, the Turkish government today
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.240]   will give you great citizenship on investment program.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   If you'll buy $400,000 worth of real estate in Turkey,
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.240]   today you can get Turkish citizenship for you and your entire family.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   You need to hold the real estate for a few years,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   then you can sell it, you can even make money on it.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   But the Turkish government denominates that not in the number of the lira,
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   but in the US dollar.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.240]   And this is--I think, again, you see this very clearly in Latin America,
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.240]   where you go throughout Latin America and frequently,
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:36.240]   even government processes, government issues,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.240]   government fees are denominated not in the local currency,
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   but in the US dollar.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   And then conversion is sometimes made.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   So when you see on a global basis that change,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   and when you see on a global basis your own neighborhood,
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   you see that people are buying and selling houses for Bitcoin
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   or for gold coins or for a different international currency,
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   then I think those are good signs that the end is nigh.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   Let me very quickly--a couple of other things.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   We talked about have your own assets.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   I think having exposure to at least one international bank account,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   really smart,
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   will probably for most people represent a small portion of your assets,
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   but at least having some money in an international bank account is really smart,
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   and this would make it a lot easier for you to get money out of the country
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   if you ever needed to.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   So this is my preferred strategy is basically have a tunnel account out.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   So if I ever need to get out of one country,
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   I need to have other accounts in other countries where I can quickly move money.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   If you're interested on this and on other aspects of internationalization,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   remember I sell a course at internationalescapeplan.com,
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   internationalescapeplan.com,
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   as to how you can get your money, yourself, your assets out of a country
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   and into a better situation.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.240]   And in that course, by the way, I go through this in a very careful way
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   of showing you how you can put in place an insurance policy,
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.240]   and for most people that's all you need is something of an insurance policy.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.240]   You don't need to take action and move to another country,
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.240]   probably not recommended for most people.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   You just need an insurance policy in case things ever did change
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   because while today the situation in 2023 may be fairly obvious,
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   we don't know what the situation is going to be like in 2043.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   We may have guesses, but we don't know.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   So preparation in advance, long before you ever need it,
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   that's the time you buy insurance policies,
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   Here's the last set of comments that I want to focus on.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   There are a lot of people in the United States
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   who are frustrated with the state of our society,
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   and I'm one of those.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:48.240]   And different people have their own reasons for disillusion or frustration.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   If you look around the political space,
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.240]   you won't find many people who will stand up and say things are going great.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.240]   I can't remember the last time I heard someone stand up
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   and just unequivocally say things are going great.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   Even the most positive of us--I try to be pretty positive,
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   focus on what's going well--but even the most positive of us
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:12.240]   would basically say, "Look at all these things that are going well,"
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   and yet recognize there's a whole bunch of stuff that's not going well.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   I think that's true.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   Don't put these things together.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   Don't assume necessarily that they're related.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   Don't assume that cultural change--
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   don't assume that bureaucratic incompetence--
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   don't assume that that automatically means the death of the country's money.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   They're not necessarily connected.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   They may be related loosely, but they're not directly causal.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   Financially, militarily, the United States is a powerhouse.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.240]   It doesn't mean the country may not have all kinds of issues. It does.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   Financially and militarily, the country is a powerhouse.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   And those things--and at its core, for all of the things wrong
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   with the United States, there's a lot of stuff right with it.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.240]   And that is worthy of appreciation.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.240]   If you're going to find an alternative to the dollar,
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   you've got to find a country where things are going better
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   and where their currency is way better on all of those issues
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.240]   and can do all of the things that the U.S. dollar does.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   And I don't see it. I don't think it exists.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   Hope this helps you. Be encouraged.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   Think as rationally as you can. Try to learn as much as you can.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   And then take appropriate levels of protection for your own situation.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:43.240]   As I've said, I look at this and I want to ensure.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   So I ensure against the U.S. dollar, but I don't--
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.240]   I'm not out on the hardcore end of just not having any connection with it.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.240]   And if you have counterarguments, I'd love to hear those.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   But I've spent a lot of time looking for them,
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   and I can't find really good arguments,
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   except from people trying to profit off of my fear and my greed.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.240]   And in line with profiting off of your fear and greed,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   if you want my very reasonably priced and very rational solution,
