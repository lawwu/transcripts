[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   What is the secret to having an incredible vacation?
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.700]   Look, I've planned thousands of vacations for hundreds of people.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.860]   And I'll tell you that it all boils down to one thing.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.860]   Is this trip choosing you or are you choosing this trip?
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860]   How organized are you for the trip that you want to have?
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.800]   Is this something you've been dreaming about for years?
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.200]   You've thought about, or is this a spontaneous pop-up that maybe you
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.160]   didn't have planned for, but you're going to go on it anyway, because
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.480]   the flights worked out or there's a great hotel or you're going to stay
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.020]   with friends or whatever, and you're just going along for the ride.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.520]   Are you in control?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.620]   And if you've planned this thing and you've been meticulous about it, or
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.140]   are you deciding, Oh, Hey, this sounds fun.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.660]   Let's go do this.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.060]   When people set out to do something and they go accomplish that trip that
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.720]   they've been thinking about dreaming about for years, whether it's a
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.940]   honeymoon or a bucket list trip or whatever, then it's incredible.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.060]   But there's also this openness for spontaneity and the opportunity that
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.860]   comes with, Oh yeah, this sounds like this could be pretty cool.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.760]   Let's do this too.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.020]   And that can be an incredible pathway too.
