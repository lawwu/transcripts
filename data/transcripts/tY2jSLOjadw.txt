[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Several dozen questions have come in over the months on the abuse of pastoral
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960]   authority. Matthias is one such listener who wrote in to ask us this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   how do I know if my pastor is a spiritual bully? What does this look like?"
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.400]   This is an extremely delicate subject, because just to talk about it can
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.360]   signify in some settings on the one hand an over sensitivity to healthy pastoral
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.560]   authority that is not bullying at all, but someone might accuse a pastor
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   wrongly of bullying just because they don't like his tone of voice or he seems
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.120]   to be a little bit more firm than they grew up experiencing by their dad. On the
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.080]   other hand, there are bad shepherds. The Bible makes it clear that there are. Our
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.360]   experience today makes it clear that there are. There are bad, abusive shepherds
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.600]   who don't love the flock. We know this from prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.320]   We know it from abuses in the New Testament. They abuse their position, use
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.280]   it for an ego trip or the need for control or even more sinister and sick
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.360]   harm done to others. So the question is very, very important, and we can fall off
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.040]   the horse of truth on either side of minimizing it or maximizing it when it's
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.360]   not really there. So I think the best approach is to ask, "Where does the Bible
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.440]   have an equivalent to bullying? What's the biblical?" I mean, the word bullying
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.840]   doesn't occur in the Bible, but the reality is there. The word is all over
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.520]   the place in the New Testament, and it might be helpful just to point out a few
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.120]   things that bullying is not, and see where we go from there. It's not the
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.080]   rightful use of authority that sometimes today we call leadership. There's no such
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.640]   thing as leadership that doesn't lead or ruling that doesn't rule or governing
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.720]   that doesn't govern. There really is governing in the church. So 1st Timothy
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.320]   517, "Let the leaders who rule or govern well be considered worthy of double
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.880]   honor," or 1 Thessalonians 512, "Respect those in the Lord who labor and are over
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.760]   you in the Lord and who admonish you," or Titus 215, "Declare these things, exhort
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.920]   and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you." So there's a place for
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.960]   strong leadership, even rebukes. People don't generally like to be rebuked.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.800]   Titus 113, "Therefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith," or
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.560]   1 Timothy 520, "For those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.840]   so that the rest may stand in fear." So the first thing to say is that we need a
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.920]   biblical, robust view of authority and leadership and even forceful words at
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.520]   times, lest we accuse a pastor of bullying when the problem may be that we
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.400]   didn't grow up in a family with any firmness in discipline and therefore
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.040]   we're hypersensitive to any tone of voice that's different than our mother's
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.160]   soft exhortations. But let's do the opposite. Now let's turn to
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.760]   passages that describe the kinds of things that might be involved in
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.640]   bullying and how a pastor should not have them. So a pastor seeks to use his
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.480]   authority to build up, not tear down. 2 Corinthians 10:8, "Even if I boast a
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.200]   little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave me for building you up and
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.080]   not for tearing you down." Is authority in the church being used for tearing
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.880]   people down, belittling people, or is it clearly in the hands of love that is
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.560]   building the people up? One of the reasons you have to rebuke one person in
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.680]   the church is because they're hurting the sheep, they're hurting other people, and
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.840]   out of love and the up-building of the other people you may have to get tough
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.920]   with a sheep herder or destroyer or a wolf in sheep's clothing. He's patient
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.280]   and kind. He doesn't have a short fuse. 1 Thessalonians 5:14, "We urge you,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.000]   with them all." Is the pastor a temper problem or is he patient with all? He's
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.480]   not quarrelsome, but gentle, a good teacher. That is, he explains things to
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.240]   win people over. He doesn't just push his ideas through because there is ideas. He
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.160]   explains and tries to win people over. So 2 Timothy 2:24, "The Lord's servant
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.000]   must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.960]   enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness." This is the opposite of
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.000]   bullying, right? God may perhaps grant them repentance, so he knows God does
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.440]   repentance producing. He doesn't do it, he can't make it happen by his
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   forcefulness. "That they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.880]   devil, having been captured by him to do his will." So the great work of
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.920]   deliverance in the church is done by not being quarrelsome, being kind, teaching,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:57.040]   patient, endurance, gentleness in all things. He has a joyful willingness to
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.480]   lead by example without domineering. 1 Peter 5, "Shepherd the flock of God that
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   is among you, exercising oversight, but not under compulsion, but willingly as
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.960]   God would have you, not for shameful gain." Does this pastor love money and is he
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.360]   abusing people as he lines his pockets? But eagerly, is he eager? Does he love his
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   work in a humble, God-exalting way? Not—here's probably the closest thing
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.800]   to bullying, verse 3, 1 Peter 5—not domineering over those in your charge, but
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.560]   being examples to the flock. Does the pastor get down and live alongside his
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200]   people, giving examples to them, or is he always pompously pronouncing with a
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.480]   domineering sense of, "I'm the big shot in this church and you guys ought to toe
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.240]   the line"? That's bullying and that's the opposite of what God calls his
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.640]   shepherds to be. He has an eagerness to heal and rescue and seek the straying.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.380]   This is one of the most indicting texts in Ezekiel 34, 4, where it says to the
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.400]   shepherds, "You have the weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.880]   healed, the injured you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.680]   the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them."
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.760]   So there's a perfect description of what bullying would—loveless bullying,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   uncaring bullying—would look like. The pastor has a desire to produce joy in
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.920]   the church by rejoicing with the church. 2nd Corinthians 124, "Not that we lorded
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.640]   over your faith, we're workers with you for your joy." There's the beautiful
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.620]   picture. He comes alongside his people. His whole goal is a happy church, happy
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.600]   in God, and he models that happiness and he gets alongside his people in
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.880]   happiness. He takes no pleasure in loading people down and watching them
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.920]   struggle. He wants to give necessary loads. There is a burden to be borne, but
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.240]   my yoke is easy and my burden is light, because the pastor's giving a
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.880]   burden-lifting gospel with every load he puts on the people for obedience. He
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.080]   gives burden-lifting help with the promises of God. The opposite of that is
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   Matthew 23, 4. "They tie"—he's talking about the Pharisees and the lawyers here—
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.960]   "they tie heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   themselves are not willing to move them with a finger." That's a perfect
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.200]   description of one who uses his preaching or his teaching to bully his
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.760]   people by laying burdens on them, but there's no gospel-lifting. There's no
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.720]   joy-giving promises to help them live out with success the burdens he's putting
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.120]   on them. And he is, finally, self-controlled, not violent, supreme love
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.280]   for Christ from 1 Timothy 3, "Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, a
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.520]   husband of one wife sober, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:26.880]   not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money." So in
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.000]   a word, my answer is to how do I know if my pastor is a spiritual bully? Go to the
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.280]   Bible, especially the New Testament, use all of it to form a well-rounded picture
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   of what biblical leadership and biblical shepherding is, and then measure your
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.400]   pastor by that. Every pastor has strengths and weaknesses. Be careful that
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.120]   you don't accuse him of bullying when there may be an aspect of his ministry
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.920]   where he's sincerely growing and improving, and always be aware of your
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.160]   own fallibility of possibly forcing a view of leadership that fits your
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.200]   preferences rather than fitting the Bible. But I'll end with this. If you
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.240]   see a pattern of serious shortcomings along the lines that we've just developed,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.040]   seek him out first. Share your concerns. His reaction to you will tell you a lot.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.400]   Thank you, Pastor John. And to turn the tables, we recorded an episode on the
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.800]   Congregations' Responsibility to Godly Leaders. That was episode number 201,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.440]   titled "How Do I Obey and Submit to My Leaders?" Find this episode and almost 500
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.920]   others in the podcast archive, maybe most easily found in the free Ask Pastor John
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.360]   app for Apple and Android devices. And if you don't have the app, you can also find

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.000]   week with a doozy. Looking at religious violence in the Middle East, ISIS, and
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.680]   comparing it to the Old Testament, one listener asks, "Did God commission
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.000]   terrorism in the Bible?" I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.040]   Ask Pastor John podcast.
