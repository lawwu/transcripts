[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Nowadays, I get a lot of questions about pornography.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.600]   And the discussion around pornography is always related to the discussion around masturbation.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.840]   But let's just talk about pornography for a moment in this context of these primitive
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.760]   drives and these circuits within the hypothalamus, which we were all born with, that clearly
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.220]   some of them are devoted to our progression as a species through reproduction, zero question
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.220]   about that.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.040]   Sexual behavior being linked to reproduction, not always, but certainly we can all agree
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   on that.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   It's a necessary precondition.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680]   I hope we can still all agree on that.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.480]   But last time I checked, that's still true.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.760]   A sperm and an egg met someplace in some context to create all of us.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   Okay.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.280]   We're still grounded in that.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.820]   Pornography is something that I hear quite a lot from typically young males, but sometimes
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.940]   young females or even older females who say that they can see themselves trying to resist
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.000]   the desire to go look at it.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.240]   And it almost doesn't feel like a desire anymore.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.120]   They're sort of just in a compulsion that is almost unconscious, but they're just aware
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   of the fact that they're-
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120]   Like an eating disorder.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   Like an eating disorder.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.120]   They're doing it.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.600]   They're just doing it and they can't help themselves.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   And we could think about two ways to attack this if one believes it's a real concern,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   and they certainly do.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.760]   So I do.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.720]   I don't, I would be open if I had or do.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.960]   Pornography has not been my thing and I don't struggle with it.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.160]   But when I hear from these people, it's so clear that they're asking, is it the prevalence
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   of pornography out there or is it something really broken in them?
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.460]   Like are they broken?
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.300]   And I don't know that I would say after having the discussion we've had thus far, that they're
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.300]   broken.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.460]   It seems to me that it's like, as you said, it's the manifestation of one part of their,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.260]   it's one personality within them.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.780]   Well, and it's been compulsively rewarded.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.980]   So when you see yourself moving towards the culmination of a desired goal, a dopamine,
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.820]   that's accompanied by dopamine release, okay?
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.260]   And so two things, you know this, but everybody who's listening might not.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.420]   There's two elements to that dopamine release.
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.940]   One is pleasure, but the other is that the dopamine, imagine that there are circuits
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.100]   activated as you're acting.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.600]   What the dopamine does is increase the probability that the circuits were, that were activated
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.980]   just before the positive experience happened, grow.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.540]   Okay, so now if you're engaged with pornography and that culminates in successful sexual satiation,
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.500]   which it can, that's what masturbation does, then the whole personality that's oriented
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.980]   toward that set of stimuli is going to come to dominate.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's very much like an addiction, except it's, you know, there has been, there's been work
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.500]   done with generally simpler animals on these phenomena called super stimuli.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.740]   I think it's stickleback fish where this was first observed.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.420]   So males, I hope I get this right, but I've got it approximately right.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.820]   I believe it's male sticklebacks will, they're very aggressive towards other male sticklebacks.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.260]   And the reason they're aggressive is because the other male sticklebacks have a red dot
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.180]   on their bellies, so they don't like red dots at all.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.720]   And so you could really enrage a stickleback with a red dot.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.840]   And if you use a red dot that's a little bigger and a little brighter than the typical red
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.140]   dot, you get a super stimulus.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.980]   It's virtually irresistible to the stickleback.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.420]   And it's weird because the maximal activation is produced by a stimulus that they wouldn't
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.420]   see in nature.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.620]   It slightly exceeds, that's exactly what pornography does, it's a super stimulus, right?
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.720]   And it's not surprising that young males in particular are susceptible to that because
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.840]   male sexuality in human beings is very visually oriented, very.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.300]   And a lot of our brain is visual, way more than virtually every other animal, certainly
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.340]   every other primate and every other mammal.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.060]   And so we have a situation where any 13-year-old boy can see more hyper-attractive super stimulus
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.540]   women in one day than the most successful man who ever lived 100 years ago would have
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.100]   ever seen in his whole life.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.500]   Yeah, well that's like an evolutionary, ecological, radical ecological transformation.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.960]   And it's worse because it's easily accessible so it takes no work, right?
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.420]   So not only is it a super stimulus, it's one that's at hand so to speak.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:45.300]   And the analog in the food world would be highly palatable, highly processed food.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060]   Yeah, sugar, fat combination.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.100]   The other day I went into a gas station to use the restroom because I was traveling home
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.100]   for Thanksgiving and I looked around and I thought, this isn't a convenience store, this
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.460]   is a pharmacy.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.760]   Anything that had chocolate also seemed to have caffeine and color, everything, every
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.520]   drink seemed to combine not just sugar but also caffeine and some other things that would
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   provide stimulants.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   Then you've got nicotine.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   Energy drinks.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.600]   And these things on their own aren't necessarily bad, any one of these one elements in low
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   enough doses, in frequent use, et cetera.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:23.080]   But maybe sugar being the one that clearly I think deserves deeper investigation, right?
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.480]   But it just occurred to me that-
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.740]   That's different than the difference between manufacturing sugar and manufacturing cocaine.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.860]   I mean, you take something that's available in its natural form in relatively low concentrations
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.860]   and purify it.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.200]   I mean, coca leaves, the natives used coca leaves forever as mild stimulant, didn't seem
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.300]   to cause them any trouble.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.500]   But that's way different than cocaine, right?
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.300]   And sugar has the same, arguably, the same pathological properties.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.500]   Well, I didn't think we were going to go here, but I think it's extremely appropriate and
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.180]   important that we do.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.040]   So I know that you followed what is essentially an elimination diet for a number of years.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.800]   You eat meat, right?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.520]   I eat meat, vegetables, fruit, and some starches, unrefined starches, in any event.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.960]   One thing that I think is absolutely clear from following a clean diet, so to speak,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.560]   of any kind, but let's say of the sort that you follow or I follow, is that you very soon
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.880]   learn the relationship between taste of the food, volume of the food, macronutrient, so
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.480]   protein, fat, or carbohydrate content, micronutrients, and satiation.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.800]   Which is, if you think about it, it's sort of like a big plate of broccoli or a big steak
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.480]   or something, the brain learns and the hypothalamus learns the association between the taste,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.640]   the caloric content, what else is in there, and satiation.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.360]   If you think about highly processed food or even combinations of multiple ingredients,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160]   it's absolutely impossible to do.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.380]   The brain can't parse what are the various things in here and how do they relate to my
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.840]   feelings of satisfaction.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.920]   It's the difference between a super drug and what I believe are the elements that were,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   that we have-
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.880]   - Explain why you think that link about satiation can't be learned in the case of these processed
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   foods.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.720]   - Yeah, because in the context of these processed foods, they're activating multiple neuron
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   systems in the hypothalamus and gut.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.040]   We know that the gut has neurons that can respond to sugar, fatty acids, and amino acid
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   content.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.240]   And there's this prominent theory that one of the main reasons we eat is to forage for
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.200]   amino acids, that we'll eat until we get enough of the essential amino acids.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   - For sure.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.880]   - And we correlate that with taste, but that the gut has neurons, we know the gut has neurons
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.080]   that signal through the vagus, up through a little relay called the no-dose ganglion,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.880]   if you wanna look at it, fun name, and then up to the dopaminergic centers of the brain,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.680]   which make us, oh, when we eat something that has a high essential amino acid content, like
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.720]   a steak, like a really tasty steak, the neurons in the gut in a way that is independent of
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.960]   taste are signaling to the brain, ah, I'm getting essential amino acids, you should
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.580]   eat more of this thing.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.120]   If those, let's just say a small fraction of those amino acids that are present in a
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.880]   candy bar or in a, you know, a package of Skittles, which I'm guessing there's very
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.640]   few of them, if any, you're gonna continue to forage for food because those neurons will
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.340]   also respond to sugar, basically, it will keep you eating until you get enough of those
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.340]   amino acids.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.240]   In other words, there are two parallel tracks, one within our taste system.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.720]   - Multiple pathways to satiation.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.080]   - Right, totally, right, multiple pathways to satiation, one dependent on taste, one
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.600]   dependent on actual nutrient content.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.200]   The mouth can only learn taste association, the mouth can't actually learn nutrient content,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   the gut knows nutrient content, the problem is you take a food that is low in a micronutrient
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.480]   or macronutrient or essential amino acids or essential fatty acids, after all, there
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.400]   are no essential carbohydrates, there are only essential amino acids and essential fatty
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   acids.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   - Right, right, right.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.000]   - And it will keep you eating and it will keep the appetite system revving until you
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   get enough of those.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.040]   Now, here's the issue, if you've ever done this, it's probably been--
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   - So that's empty calories.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   - Empty calories.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.040]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.760]   - But what's, so in some ways, you know, this again is an analog to the whole discussion
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.160]   around pornography, masturbation and reproduction, right?
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.880]   I'm not saying that reproduction is the be all, end all of sexual activity, but in the
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.400]   evolutionary sense, it absolutely is, right?
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.560]   There's no question about that, there's no moral judgment there, that's just the reality.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:23.200]   So the situation with food is the following, if we are eating without any gut level understanding
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.800]   of what's coming in, we will keep eating.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.520]   If you, let me give an example, you probably haven't done this experiment in a while, but
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.000]   if you've ever just had, you know, ribeye steak or two, it's pretty satiating.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.280]   Maybe you also have a salad if you're me or some broccoli or something like that.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   If one takes, then even after you've eaten all that, one bite of pasta, one bite of pasta,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.320]   the next impulse is more, right?
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.760]   Even though you already have enough essential amino acids from those steaks, you're loosing,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.960]   you know, threshold, you've reached that, et cetera, all of that good stuff, why?
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.540]   Because blood glucose goes up and then you desire more because blood glucose elevations
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.260]   are linked directly to the dopaminergic system.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.420]   So what I'm basically trying to say here is that I do think that there are elements to
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.240]   our food, modern food, if you will.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.060]   It seems like it's, you know, anything but modern in the sense that it's worse for us
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.380]   than the more primitive foods, but highly processed foods, pornography, any drug that
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.920]   spikes dopamine dramatically, like methamphetamine, for instance, any behavior that spikes dopamine
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.800]   dramatically that very quickly hijacks these circuits.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.120]   And to me, the way to teach those circuits a calmer, more prudent version of themselves,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.080]   right, to enter a different hypothalamic activation pattern, is to start breaking the things down
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.440]   into their essential elements, right?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.560]   About the motivation, the pleasure, et cetera, to tamp all that down.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.800]   I mean, we know that for pornography, if the pornography is very extreme, then less extreme
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.400]   pornography doesn't seem to work.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.120]   - Well, that's 'cause there's also a novelty kick in dopaminergic striving, right?
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:04.680]   So, with any basic appetitive pleasure, there's a dopaminergic kick, but with any novelty,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   there's also a dopaminergic kick.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.280]   So there's an optimized threshold for novelty in appetitive striving that plays out in pornography.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:22.000]   So there's the direct effect of the stimulus as such, but there's variation in the stimulus
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.360]   that's also novel, and so it's a common pattern for pornographic usage to become more, what
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.560]   would you say, fetishistic.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   That's one way of thinking about it as it progresses, because that keeps the novelty
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   alive.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.600]   That's very dangerous, that's a very dangerous development.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.640]   - Right, and I would venture in a very different domain, that if you were to eat your steak
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.120]   slathered in barbecue sauce for a couple of weeks, going back to the way that you eat
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.200]   them now, which by the way, this is a great opportunity to educate people about something
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.280]   that you taught me when we had dinner last, which is that if you're gonna order a steak,
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   order a Pittsburgh char.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The char on the outside is incredibly tasty.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.120]   We love that, the umami taste, I wish you have a devoted taste receptor for that.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   - It's complex.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.280]   - Yeah, and if they don't know what a Pittsburgh char is, then maybe you're in the wrong restaurant
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.480]   or you need to educate them, but incredibly satiating, delicious, right?
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.200]   But if you were to slather those steaks in a bunch of things, I would suspect that after
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.320]   a while, your plain steaks wouldn't taste as good.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.120]   But the way to make them taste good again would be to eat them plain for a period of
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.920]   time in which the stuff that all the condiments, et cetera, would start to become aversive.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:35.880]   I do believe that when we return to the sort of most naturally satisfying mode of engaging
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.140]   with these circuits, here we're talking about food and sex in parallel, that they become
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.440]   especially satiating.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.520]   And I think that, you know, in hearing from all these people that are addicted to pornography,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.440]   and they're not addicted like it's telling me they love it and they can't stop.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.880]   They're telling me it's no longer working for them, that there's this, you know, diminishment
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.420]   in the amount of dopamine that they're getting over time, and they feel trapped within it,
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.600]   and they have no sense whatsoever because they haven't been socialized to go out and
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.240]   find a real relationship, a real sexual relationship or a relationship of any kind.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.840]   - Well, it's also, there is some evidence suggesting too that if you've been socialized
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.200]   into pornography sexuality, it's actually quite difficult to establish a sexual relationship
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.480]   with an actual partner.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.080]   Now, I would say to some degree that's always been difficult because it's a complex form
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:29.480]   of behavior, but the introduction of pornography, well, it sets up a whole landscape of expectation,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.080]   for example, that's not necessarily going to play out that well in the real world, let's
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   say.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:41.240]   - And there's also a learning of those biological systems in the brain to evoke arousal by observing
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.600]   sex as opposed to participating, completely different.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   So some of these-
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.880]   - Right, that's voyeur, right?
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   You're basically learning to be a voyeur, right, right.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.440]   - And so you think about young brains that are highly plastic, learning that.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   So the returning-
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.760]   - Yeah, we have no idea what to make of that because, especially for young men, because
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.280]   when they hit puberty, sexuality becomes a very insistent force, and we have no idea
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.120]   what effect pornography has on the development of male sexuality, none.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   (upbeat music)
