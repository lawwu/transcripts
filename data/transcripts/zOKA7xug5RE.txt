[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.200]   We have an email from Christina in Norman, Oklahoma today
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000]   who asks, oh, this is a good question.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   In our overly digital and connected age,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560]   I often feel so overwhelmed with how much global
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.640]   and local suffering I feel both a desire
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.000]   and a Christian obligation to stay informed on,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.220]   pray for, and be involved in.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.760]   Sex trafficking, Syrian refugees,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040]   homeless people in my city,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.520]   the Black Lives and the Blue Lives Matter movements,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.740]   abortion activism, suffering members of my church,
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.940]   reaching the unreached, and on and on it goes.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060]   I wanna pray, but I find it so overwhelming
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.420]   because the prayer list is so long and I wanna act,
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.160]   but I'm paralyzed by how much there is to do.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.780]   I truly believe this stems from a lack
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.320]   of deep heart conviction of God's sovereignty.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.520]   Could you maybe share how you stay balanced
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.900]   and aware in praying and acting for the pain
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.060]   and suffering around the world?
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.060]   And specifically, how does your belief in God's sovereignty
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.440]   in the midst of all this suffering
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.700]   affect the way you live and pray?
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.000]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Christina?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.580]   Well, I'm not sure I can say how balanced I stay
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.580]   because I don't, I so totally resonate
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.560]   with this sense of overload from the internet
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.080]   and from news venues about bad news.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.880]   I mean, I am more impressed with it now than ever.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.920]   I mean, I've always been impressed with how much sorrow
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440]   and pain and bad news there is in the world,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   but recently, you go down the list of Google News
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.860]   on any topic and it's really bleak.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.500]   So I get this, I really do, and I have no idea
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.900]   whether I have become the balanced person I need to be,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.740]   but I can just point to how I fight the battle,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.560]   and here they are, several steps.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   One, accept, I try to accept, and I would encourage Christina
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.280]   to try to accept the goodness of groaning.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.300]   Ezekiel 9, verse four, "The Lord said to him," to Ezekiel,
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.560]   "Pass through the city, through Jerusalem,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.620]   "and put a mark on the foreheads of the men
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.000]   "who sigh and groan over the abominations
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.260]   "that are committed in it," which means God
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   is marking them for favor, and they are groaners.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.220]   They're not chipper, "Oh, praise God, anyhow,"
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.840]   kind of observers of the abominations.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   They groan over American sinfulness in this culture,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   and so if she's one of them, I'm saying accept that role
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.200]   and expect to have it until you die.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   You will groan all the way home, and if you don't,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.800]   you're not paying attention or you become callous.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.240]   Second, realize that only God's shoulders
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.880]   can bear the boulders of global suffering.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.560]   I don't know whether God expects us
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.520]   to look at every possible piece of news
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.260]   coming from around the world.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.280]   I doubt it.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   I don't think it's possible even to see them,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480]   and if we could see them, I think only He is capable
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.740]   of managing so much bad news.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.880]   Cast your burden, this is Psalm 55, 22,
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.480]   cast your burden on the Lord, and He will sustain you.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.920]   He will never permit the righteous to be moved
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.660]   or to be paralyzed, and I think that burden
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.520]   is cast on the Lord because we cannot bear it.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   We cannot bear it, and then the last thing on this point
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.200]   is 1 Peter 5, 7, "Cast all your anxieties,"
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.760]   so not just your burdens, but all your anxieties,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.680]   "on Him because He cares for you,"
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.080]   and then he adds, "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.840]   "Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.480]   "seeking someone to devour."
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.820]   In other words, one of these anxieties
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   that we cast on the Lord is massive supernatural evil.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.520]   I mean, it's not just little items of news
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.200]   that are coming across the internet.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   It's a demonic force behind those things,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.400]   which if we could see it, we would realize
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.880]   that we are a feather before that hurricane,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   and therefore, we must constantly cast those anxieties
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.920]   on the Lord because He has defeated Satan,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.880]   and He can handle him quite nicely.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   Number three, give thanks for the diversity
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   of the gifting of the body of Christ.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.720]   If I thought that I had to do everything
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.560]   that God wants His church to do, I would despair.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.800]   I would be paralyzed.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.040]   Are all apostles, are all prophets, are all teachers,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   do all work miracles, do all possess gifts of healing?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.400]   I mean, that's an important one.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.800]   Like, you may not be able to heal a person
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.120]   that you see needs healing, and somebody else
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.480]   might be able to meet exactly the need that they have,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.840]   and therefore, you're not called
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.060]   to bear that particular burden,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.960]   but to be thankful for the body of Christ.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.440]   Number four, trust God for the grace to do the good
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.200]   He expects you to do, not others,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.240]   and then do the good in your path like the good Samaritan.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.100]   2 Corinthians 9:8, "God is able to make all grace
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.160]   "abound to you, so that having all sufficiency
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.180]   "in all things at all times, you may abound
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.900]  ," now, how you interpret this next phrase
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.180]   is the difference between despair and joyful hope,
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.660]   "that you may abound in every good work."
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.660]   Does that mean God gives you the grace
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.500]   and the sufficiency at all times, in every way,
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.620]   in every place, to do the good work
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.500]   that a Christian in China is expected to do this afternoon?
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   No, no, no, every good work there means
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.660]   everyone appointed for you,
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.900]   which is a wonderfully liberating thing.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.760]   You will never be asked to do a good work
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.220]   for which this verse is not true.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.100]   Every grace will be there for you to do it.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.060]   God doesn't intend for you to look at 30 good works.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   No, you can only do five today and feel guilty about 25.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.220]   He absolutely does not want that to be the case.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.740]   That's why this verse is in the Bible.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.740]   And so, yes, there will be grace for every good work.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.740]   Number five, pray big, global prayers
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.920]   that Jesus taught us to pray,
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   including for more workers in the harvest.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.220]   Our Father who art in heaven,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.620]   big prayer number one, hallowed be your name.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.180]   Big prayer number two, your kingdom come.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.220]   Big prayer number three,
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.420]   your will be done on earth as in heaven.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420]   It's good to pray big, global,
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.900]   general, sweeping prayers,
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.200]   and then pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.340]   to send out more laborers.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.700]   I mean, we can see specific needs that need to be met.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.940]   We can only do a fraction.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.260]   And Jesus says, "Go ahead, ask me, ask me.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.500]   "I have laborers.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.420]   "I'll send them, ask me."
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.060]   Number six, regularly pray
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.020]   that God would show you what more you can do.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   Galatians 6:10, "So then, as we have opportunity,"
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.500]   as we have opportunity, kairos in Greek.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.380]   I love that word, kairos,
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.620]   a special, particular moment in time
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.620]   that's designed for a good work.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.040]   "As we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.420]   "especially to those who are the household of God."
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.020]   So we pray, Lord, create those opportunities for me,
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.640]   those kairoi, and help me see them and embrace them.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.300]   That's how we don't settle into being content
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.420]   with yesterday's grace.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.320]   Yesterday, you did a good deed, two good deeds,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.260]   three good deeds.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.380]   You gave this, you gave that, you did this.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.420]   You treated this person kindly.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.820]   That's yesterday.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.500]   Today, Lord, what's the new opportunity
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.900]   for doing good to people,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.600]   especially to the household of God?
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.900]   So we pray, show me, Lord, how to use my money
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.540]   and my time and my energy and my gifts.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   And lastly, I would say, rest in the sovereignty of God.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.940]   I am God and there is no other.
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.460]   I am God and there's none like me,
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.380]   declaring the end from the beginning
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.980]   and from ancient times, things not yet done,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.460]   saying, "My counsel shall stand
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.540]   "and I will accomplish all my purpose."
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.340]   - So good, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.200]   and thank you for the wonderfully insightful question,

[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.640]   (upbeat music)
