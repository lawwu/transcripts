[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to the second edition of the Boglehead speaker series.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.120]   We're holding these virtual events online
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.320]   obviously because of COVID, and it's the goal to get back to
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.440]   in-person conferences by 2022.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.360]   In just a moment, I'm going to introduce Dan Ariely, who
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.600]   is the behavioral economist I think has done far
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.240]   more than anyone else in actually changing people's behavior.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.200]   But first I have to go through a few housekeeping items.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.400]   I'm Alan Roth. I'm a board member of the John C. Bogle
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.640]   Center for Financial Literacy. We are a 501(c)(3)
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.680]   not-for-profit with the mission
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.880]   of expanding John Bogle's legacy by promoting
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.160]   the principles of successful investing and financial
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   well-being through education and community.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.640]   Our website is boglecenter.net, and
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760]   since I'm also treasurer of the organization, I would
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.560]   be remiss if I didn't say you can make
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.320]   donations at the boglecenter.net, and
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.360]   they are not only appreciated, but tax-deductible.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   I want to thank the entire board for all of their work. I
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.560]   want to single out Mike Nolan, who, as most of you
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.680]   probably know, was Jack Bogle's chief
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.720]   operating officer, helped millions of people, and has done the
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.840]   heavy lifting for these events, these speaker series
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   events. I want to thank Vanguard for giving us the resources
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.360]   to host these conferences, and of course for
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.440]   helping millions of us move towards financial independence.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.480]   And finally, all of you in the Bogleheads community, thank you for
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.680]   the questions you submitted, and especially for all you
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.280]   do online to help millions of people also
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.960]   without any profit motive.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.080]   Now the main event, Dan Ariely.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.640]   I'm not going to read his incredibly impressive bio
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.760]   because you can Google that. I want to try to tell you a couple
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.440]   of things you may not know about him.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.520]   First of all, the first book that I read of his was
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880]   predictably irrational. I had never met Dan, had
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.400]   any contact with Dan, but I felt like he'd been studying
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.720]   my behavior for the last three decades.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.080]   Brilliant.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.640]   Next, I want to tell you what I think Dan Ariely and
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280]   John Bogle have in common.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.440]   First of all, we all know that Jack Bogle taught us about the dangers
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   of expenses. Dan Ariely taught me the dangers
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.920]   of emotions, which can be just as destructive.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.040]   I'm just going to be very candid. I've had three
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.160]   longtime Bogleheads come to me
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.960]   who had once had brilliantly low cost diversified
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.160]   portfolios, who did the predictably irrational
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.520]   thing and sold in March when stocks were down
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   by 30-35%.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.120]   Now, we all know that Jack Bogle worked tirelessly
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.360]   to help people improve their well-being, and I
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.280]   can tell you that Dan Ariely does the same thing. Nights,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.560]   weekends, around the clock. I think they both have figured out
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.600]   how not to sleep.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.280]   And Dan not only helps people here in the US and
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.880]   developed countries and developing countries as well,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.800]   where learning to save can make the difference between taking a child
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.760]   to the doctor or not. And then finally,
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.400]   Jack was an incredibly nice, kind, giving person.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.440]   I felt very fortunate to know. And Dan Ariely
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.480]   is the exact same way. I feel very fortunate
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.600]   to know you, Dan. And now, Dan, the main
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.720]   event, take it over. Talk for about 40-45
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.760]   minutes or so, and then I will ask a few
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.640]   of the questions that came in from the Bogleheads.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.800]   Wonderful. So first of all, thanks a lot for this introduction.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.000]   It's an honor to be here and to be part
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.120]   of this. And maybe before I start
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.080]   talking about behavioral economics, money and investing,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.160]   I'll mention that why
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.360]   I have half a beard. And it's not because I
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.480]   lost a bet. Many years ago, I was badly burned.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   Most of my body is covered with scars, about 70 percent,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   and including the right side of my face. So
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.400]   I just don't have hair on this side, and that's the reason for
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.440]   the half beard. And I'm
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.800]   mentioning up front because somebody told me that unless I clear it up,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   they keep on wondering for the whole time, like, "What's the point of this
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.320]   half a beard?" So now you know there's no point.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.640]   That's just the random luck of the accident.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.040]   Okay. So behavioral economics.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.320]   Behavioral economics is a field that, in general,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.440]   doesn't assume that people are rational.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.360]   In fact, we put people in different situations, and we
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.720]   see what happens. And in most cases,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.840]   we find that people are acting irrationally
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.280]   in predictable ways. So people deviate from rationality.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's one of the main reasons that derail us from
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.360]   being rational, but it's not the only one.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.920]   So we basically question humans' ability
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.200]   to make good decisions. And we question it in all kinds of ways.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.240]   We question our ability to sleep enough
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.280]   and to exercise and to take our medication
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.400]   and to eat well and to take care of the planet and so on and so forth.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.440]   But we also do it in the domain of money.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.120]   And today we'll focus not on the total
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.800]   influence of behavioral economics, but how do we think
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.320]   about money?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.560]   So first of all, before we talk about what
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.600]   people actually do, let's mention a little bit what
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.960]   they should be doing, what we should be doing. Imagine we were perfectly
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   rational. And let's ask something
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.880]   about the nature of money. What is money all about?
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.360]   And money is an amazing invention, as
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.640]   important as the wheel. In a world without
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.280]   money, think about how tough it will be to manage.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.440]   Maybe you would raise broccoli and I
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.640]   would raise chickens, and then we would have to meet and we'll have to decide
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.760]   about what's the exchange rate between broccoli and
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.640]   chickens. And maybe you didn't want a whole chicken, you
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.520]   would use us half and everything would be really complex.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.680]   So we created money, an amazing invention,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.880]   because everything in society can be mapped into money
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.440]   and we don't have to trade things directly.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.280]   And money is also divisible and we can store it in office
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.240]   and all kinds of things can happen. So I'm a university
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.880]   professor. Imagine I had to barter for my services.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.200]   Who would pay and how would it work out? Not to mention I'll waste
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   a lot of time on doing this, but
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.040]   nobody would invest in long-term things that
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.800]   we would all want just to get things that we need at the moment.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.960]   So money allows us to basically exchange
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.720]   and save and think about the future. Plus, it also
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   allows us to invest, which is a really interesting thing.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.040]   Now, so that's money and the way we should
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.920]   think about money is about opportunity cost.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.680]   What does it mean that we should think about money's opportunity cost? Every
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.040]   time we go to buy a cup of coffee, we should
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.400]   ask ourself, is this the best use for money or is
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.520]   there somewhere some other use that I could find for this
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   money that would be different, would be better?
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.320]   Now, it sounds strange and if you think to yourself, like
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.520]   ask yourself, when was the last time you thought about it this way? When was the
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.760]   last time you thought about buying something and you say,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.200]   could I could I do something better with my money?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.240]   And the reality is that even if you do it from time to time,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.640]   we certainly don't do it a lot.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.800]   And we don't do it for small purchases, but we also don't do it for large
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.080]   purposes, large purchases. And I'll give you an example.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.880]   A few years ago, I went to a Toyota dealership and these were people who
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   already talked to the dealer. They already got the price. They knew their
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.360]   monthly price. They knew the total price. And they were still debating whether to
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.720]   get the car or not and whether to add some features to it or not.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.920]   And I caught them at that moment. And I said,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.600]   if you are going to go ahead and buy this car today,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.320]   what would you not be able to do? What are you giving up?
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.240]   And you would expect that everybody would have an answer.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.120]   Making a big decision, putting money into one thing, what will they not be able to do?
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.240]   Nobody had an answer. Why? Because they haven't thought about it.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.800]   So then I pushed them and I said, look, if you go ahead and buy this car today,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   something will have to give. What would it be?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You know what was the most common answer I got?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   If I buy this Toyota, I can't buy a Honda.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.720]   Now, of course, that's true, but it's irrelevant. That's not what I was really asking.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:52.760]   What I was asking was, what is the intertemporal trade-off across multiple products?
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.480]   What I expected people to say, what I would want people to say is,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.240]   I'm giving up a thousand lattes and 17 books and three weeks of vacation,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   one week over the next each of three years.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.120]   These are the trade-offs we're really making.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.720]   But the reality is that we can't think about this.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.480]   And, you know, we said that money is beautiful and wonderful and its value
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   is that we can map it to almost everything in life, right?
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.920]   We can buy coffee and books and vacation and all kinds of other things.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.280]   But that's also the source of its trouble.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.640]   In English, there's an expression when we think about a tough decision,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.720]   we say it's like comparing apples to oranges.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.080]   Turns out comparing apples to oranges is very easy.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.040]   You don't see anybody baffled by the fruit plate saying,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.280]   oh my goodness, I have no idea, apple or an orange.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.920]   The challenge comes when it comes to valuing those things.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.400]   So apple and orange, you know, each of you know right now which one you would prefer.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.880]   If it's a beautiful orange, it will be different.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.720]   But if I showed you an apple and orange, you would know.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.200]   But if I asked you, is an apple worth 50 cents, 75 cents?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.640]   What about $1.25?
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.000]   Now you have to admit that it's not that clear.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.320]   You see an apple and orange, each have an adonic impression.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   We get the feeling of the value, the pleasure we will get from the apple,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.160]   the pleasure we would get from the orange.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.200]   And we can compare which one of those things would be more pleasurable.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.040]   When I tell you $1.25, you don't have a representation
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.880]   of what's the best thing I could do with $1.25 now and later.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.480]   And let me see if that pleasure across all kinds of things
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.720]   is bigger than the pleasure of an apple.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.400]   The reality is that what makes money so wonderful,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.520]   the fact that we can buy lots of things with it,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.720]   that it's divisible, storable, and so on,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.160]   it's also what makes it so complex to deal with.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.080]   And money, we have to admit, is just a very complex entity.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.720]   Very hard to figure out what is the true value of something.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.600]   By the way, there's something that we have the illusion
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.240]   that we know what the value is.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.120]   If I tell you how much would you pay for a can of Budweiser beer,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.680]   you have a sense of what it will be.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.640]   Let's say $2.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.200]   But the reality is it's not because that's the real value,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.160]   it's because you got used to paying that amount.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.400]   And now you think of it as the real value.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.960]   But if you thought of it in terms of pleasure,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.280]   it would be a different story.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.040]   So money is wonderful, money is difficult.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.120]   And the reality is that modern technology
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.920]   is making things not better, but worse.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.320]   Why is it worse?
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   Imagine that we lived in a world that there was only cash.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   There was money, but only cash.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.600]   And I gave you every morning, I would give you $50.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   So here's $50, spend it today on anything you want.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.040]   Very quickly, you would realize the opportunity cost.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.520]   You would say, if I buy a big breakfast,
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.120]   I don't have time for money for lunch.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.480]   If I buy a big lunch, I don't have money for medication, and so on.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:12.520]   What if I gave you $350 in the beginning of the week for all seven days?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.560]   Well, what would happen is that Monday, you would say, I'm rich.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.480]   There's no opportunity cost.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.120]   By Thursday, you would realize you're out.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.160]   What would happen if I gave you the money monthly?
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.840]   What would happen if I also gave you a mortgage,
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.520]   and car payments, and credit cards?
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.600]   Now you can see how life is actually becoming very complex,
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.680]   and we're not set to understand the trade-offs that we're making.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.520]   So in a world in which I would give you $50 every day,
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.680]   and I said, what if you bought something for $40,
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.280]   you would understand the consequences.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.040]   But if you ask me today, what will happen if I bought a new bicycle?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.560]   I actually really want a new bicycle.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.320]   But what would happen if I bought this new bicycle?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.080]   I can't tell you where the money would come from.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.440]   I really can't.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.000]   A little bit less inheritance for my kids.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.080]   Is it coming from something else?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.200]   So unclear, because I'm paying it on a credit card,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.640]   and so many things are happening.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.360]   Very, very hard to figure out opportunity costs.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.160]   So money relies on the idea that we will have opportunity costs,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.360]   that we have a kind of intuitive notion of opportunity costs, but we don't.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   And modern technology, things like mortgages, and loans, and credit cards,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.000]   are making it much more diffused and much more complex.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.840]   So money is amazing.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.880]   It's about opportunity costs, but we can't figure it the right way.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.680]   So what do we do?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.000]   We think about money the wrong way.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.200]   And it turns out there's lots of wrong ways to think about money.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.040]   I'll just give you a couple of examples.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.080]   One example is relativity.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:02.600]   So this is an example from Tversky and Kahneman, a little adjusted for the times.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.880]   But imagine that you go to a store.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.320]   You go to a store to buy a pen.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.080]   The pen is $15, and you pick the pen, and you go to the cashier,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.880]   and the cashier said, look, you're a really kind, wonderful human being.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   You have a beautiful smile.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.240]   I have to tell you something.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.360]   We have a sister store four blocks down the street,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.920]   and day to day are selling the same exact pen for $7 instead of $15.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.120]   It's a beautiful day, only four blocks.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.520]   If you feel like walking to the other store and buying it for $7 instead of $15,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.560]   perfectly fine with me.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.240]   What would you do?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.800]   Would you go to that other store, or would you buy the same store for $15?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.320]   Most people say they would go to the second store,
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.880]   and the people who would stay in that store don't feel good about
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.440]   spending the $15 on a pen.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.520]   Case number two.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.000]   You're buying an Armani suit.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.160]   It's $1,015.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.840]   As you check out, the cashier says, look, you're a really nice person with a very nice smile.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.440]   I have to tell you, we have a sister store four blocks down the street selling the same exact suit
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.320]   for $1,007, $8 less.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.120]   It's a beautiful day.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.160]   It's only four blocks down.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.280]   If you want to go, go ahead and go to that other store.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.800]   How many of us would walk in the second case?
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.280]   Some people still walk in the second case, but they feel bad about it.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.760]   They feel that they are extra stingy about it.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.560]   But the majority of people walk in the first store and don't walk in the second store.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   Now, both cases, it's a question of trade-off.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.200]   It is four minutes walking, four blocks walking in a nice weather worth $8 savings or not.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.880]   And your bank account doesn't know where the money is coming from.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.240]   The bank account doesn't know if it came from saving on an Armani suit,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.760]   or it came on saving on a pen.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.840]   But we think about money in relative terms.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.120]   And when we buy something big, no problem.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.840]   Let's spend more.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.960]   When we buy something small, we're very, very sensitive to deviations.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.440]   Here's another example.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.240]   I'm sure many of you have renovated an apartment or a house at some point.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.840]   And probably a version of the following thing happened to you.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   The contractor came to you and said, for only $2,000 more, and they use the term only,
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.880]   you can buy something Italian.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   You can upgrade to something Italian.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.360]   It's a faucet.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.280]   It's a tile.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.240]   It's something Italian.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.800]   And you say to yourself, it's only $2,000.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   Of course, let's go for it.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.200]   And then you go to the grocery store, and you stand by the tomatoes.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.320]   And you think to yourself, should you buy the cheap tomatoes or the expensive tomatoes?
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.520]   And your whole life of making decisions about tomatoes will not amount to $2,000.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.960]   But tomatoes are relatively cheap.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.880]   And every small difference looks big.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   But if you're spending so much money on renovating your house, $2,000 look, relatively speaking,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.040]   so small that you don't pay as much attention to.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.520]   And that's the thing about relativity.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.760]   Money is absolute.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's not relative.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.440]   But we think about money in relative terms.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.200]   And that gets us into all kinds of trouble.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   That's why when we buy big things, we're likely to be tempted and spend way too much.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:29.720]   And when we buy small things, we might focus too much on small differences and eventually
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.520]   not get the things that give us more happiness.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.720]   So that's mistake number one.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.600]   We think about money in relative terms, not in absolute terms.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.760]   Ellen and I had lots of discussions about asset undermanagement.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.320]   And is it reasonable to pay a percentage of asset undermanagement?
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.440]   That's a relative argument.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   And a lot of people think it's perfectly fine because they think it's a percentage,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.280]   a small percentage.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.080]   And we don't think about the absolute number of it.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.120]   OK, mistake number two.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:19.960]   Spending has to do with the timing of the spending and the modality of the spending.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.840]   So imagine that you're going to a restaurant.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.800]   Let's say it's over COVID.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.600]   You're going to a restaurant.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.680]   It's a wonderful restaurant.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.360]   It's an expensive dinner.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.560]   It's, let's say, $200.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.800]   And at the end of the meal, you can pay either with cash or with credit cards.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.120]   And now I want to ask you, which one would feel worse, the cash or the credit?
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   And almost everybody agrees the cash is much worse.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.200]   Now, why is it much worse?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.880]   What does it mean that it's much worse?
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.320]   You know, restaurants have their prices printed on the menu.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.360]   You know what it's going to be.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.560]   It's not a big surprise.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.960]   Why is paying cash so much worse?
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   And it turns out it has to do with the timing of consumption and eating.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.800]   And to prove it, let me take you through a thought exercise.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.080]   And let's make things worse.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.320]   Imagine I own the restaurant.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.720]   And I discover that people eat 50 bites and pay $50.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:22.200]   And I told you that because you're a wonderful, caring human being, I will charge you half price.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.880]   Instead of a dollar per bite on average, I'll charge you 50 cents per bite.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.960]   And not only that, I'll only charge you for the bite you eat.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.760]   The bites you don't eat, you don't need to pay.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.840]   So I'll serve you your dish.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.600]   I'll sit back and I'll take my notepad.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.480]   And every time you take a bite, I'll mark a little V on my notepad.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.400]   At the end of the meal, I'll charge you 50 cents per bite you eat.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.080]   The bites you don't eat, you don't need to pay for.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.360]   How much fun will that meal be?
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.560]   The answer is not that much.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.120]   When I teach my students here at Duke, when I teach them the psychology of money, I bring pizza
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.680]   and I charge them 25 cents per bite.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.560]   What do you think happens?
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.800]   Huge bites.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.640]   And it takes such huge bites, they don't enjoy the whole process.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.360]   And you would think they would learn after one bite.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.480]   No, you sit there with the pizza and it's so tempting to push it a bit more in
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.560]   and get more value for money.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.360]   And at the end of the day, they don't enjoy the whole process.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   They pay very little, but they lose all the enjoyment.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.560]   So what's the point of it?
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.880]   The point of it is that if you think about a timeline, when payment and consumption coexist,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.800]   we enjoy it less.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.040]   When you pay per bite, you enjoy it less.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:47.000]   When we separate those things in time, the pain of paying goes away.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.880]   So if we pay in advance, it's less.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.800]   If we pay at the end, it's less.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.480]   When we pay per consumption, it's much, much worse.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.120]   You probably remember the day with taxis before Uber.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.800]   How many of you remember days in which you were in the cab and you were like
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.240]   two blocks from your hotel and the traffic was stopped and you saw the meter running
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.680]   and you said to the taxi, "You know what?
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.240]   Stop here.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.880]   I'll get out."
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.200]   We don't do it with Uber.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   Not because it doesn't continue.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.360]   We just don't see the meter running.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.600]   But looking at the meter running, even though it's a small amount, is so annoying that we
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.040]   get out earlier.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:35.800]   Or some of you might remember the days before phone calls were buffet-style, right?
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.000]   Right now we're paying one payment.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.720]   But you would call your mother and you would see the minutes running and we didn't call
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.800]   as much and it was less pleasant because we were thinking about the amount.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.600]   And even if it's 10 cents per minute, the fact that it's increasing is worse.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.760]   So we said when things coincide, we see the meter running, we pay attention, we feel worse
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.240]   about it.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   When we separate them and we pay less attention, we feel less bad about spending and therefore
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.200]   we spend more.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.240]   By the way, that's, of course, how credit cards work.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.200]   But credit cards work by doing two things.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.640]   The first, they make it such that we have a big amount rather than a small amount.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.640]   We talked about relativity.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.960]   If you put another $200 on your credit card, instead of $2000 it will be $2200.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Not such a big deal.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.000]   You take a big number, you just add to it, doesn't feel as bad.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.680]   And the second is you don't think that you're paying right now.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.600]   It's the opposite of seeing the meter running.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.080]   It's the opposite of paying in cash.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   Now, sometimes we don't want pain of paying.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.120]   Sometimes we do.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:57.160]   So you know what happens when people get their electricity bill and they move it to be paid
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.000]   automatically from their checking account?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.560]   Consumption increases by about 4%.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.760]   Not immediately, but over time.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.380]   Why?
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:14.760]   If you get the bill and you sit there and you write the check, at those moments when you
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.840]   write the check, you're pissed off and you terrorize your family members.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.520]   You say, close the light and why are you doing this and do this?
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.560]   And it's not a big deal.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.000]   It doesn't last for very long.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.440]   But there's a little bit of terrorizing going on as you write the check.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.000]   What happens when it comes automatically from our bank account?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.120]   We don't pay the same amount of attention to it.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.800]   What happens?
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.400]   We don't get upset as much.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   We don't terrorize our family members.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   And slowly, the amount increases.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.360]   Now, here you can ask yourself, is terrorizing the family worth or not worth 4%
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.240]   of increased consumption of electricity?
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   You decide for it.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.000]   But here's another example.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.320]   Imagine you're going to a cruise.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.160]   Cruise to Alaska.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:01.960]   Amazing cruise.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.560]   $5,000.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.320]   Two weeks.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:05.820]   Amazing.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.960]   And you can do one of two things.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.080]   You can pay for the cruise six months in advance.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.600]   Or you can pay the moment you get off the boat.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.240]   Which one of those is better?
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   Now, when we think about financially better,
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.800]   what would you say?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.440]   You would say, of course, let's create the last day of the cruise.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.560]   I get to keep the money.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.240]   Maybe I get some interest, and so on.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   But how would you feel on the cruise?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.280]   And especially, how would you feel on the last day of the cruise
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.960]   if you know that tomorrow you have to pay $5,000?
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.440]   You would probably spend the whole day in the buffet trying to amortize your investment.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:44.780]   Right?
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:50.120]   So when you think about these things, sometimes we want more pain of pain.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:56.520]   Sometimes we might say, I don't want to feel very good about consuming electricity.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.120]   I want it actually to be more painful.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.560]   Or cigarettes.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.080]   But there are some things we want less pain of pain.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.200]   Because we want to increase consumption.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.240]   For example, in health care, I never understood it.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.680]   I don't understand why they have a co-pay for colonoscopies.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   Like, who exactly is going to have two of those if it was free?
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.200]   But I understand it for massages, pedicures.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.960]   But colonoscopy, come on.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.680]   Mine is due in April.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.080]   That's a top of mind.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.360]   So the point is that money is not just money.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.120]   It's how much attention are we paying it.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.640]   And when we pay attention to money, we spend less.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.680]   We think a bit more about the opportunity cost.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.960]   We're more aware of our spending.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.760]   And we spend less.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.600]   And when we don't pay attention, we do it less.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.040]   A couple of other examples to think about.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.840]   Imagine that you walk down the street.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.280]   And you walk down the street.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.240]   And you look at the store.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.360]   And you see a beautiful hat.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.520]   And you're not a hat person.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.480]   And you never had a hat.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.680]   But you're really curious.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.280]   And you go into the store.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.080]   And you try the hat.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.160]   Right color.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.880]   The right size.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.840]   You really like this hat.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.840]   But you look at the price tag.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.160]   And you say, I can't possibly justify buying a hat for this amount of money.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.120]   I'm not a hat person.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.440]   And you leave it alone.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.160]   And you walk home.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.840]   You walk home.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.400]   And you get home.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.040]   And you discover that your significant other bought you that exact same hat
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.320]   from your joint check income.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.640]   How do you feel?
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.000]   You say, honey, thank you very much for thinking about me.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   I love this hat.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.920]   But I looked at it already.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.760]   And I decided it was not worth the money.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.640]   Please go back.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.760]   Put it back in the store.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.560]   And return the money to our joint check income.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.320]   Of course not.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.380]   Why?
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.240]   Because what that other person did was to take away the pain of paying.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.800]   You wanted the hat.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.840]   You just didn't want the guilt connected to it.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.200]   And by giving you it as a gift, that person took away the guilt.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.040]   By the way, that's what good gifts are about.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.400]   If you think about, you know, we're kind of in a gift-giving season.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.360]   If you think about what good gifts are,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.440]   good gifts are not a transfer of money.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.600]   Good gifts are buying things to people that have a high guilt component of spending.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.040]   That people would not spend for themselves.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.800]   Okay, one final example.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.440]   Imagine you have employees.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   Or imagine you all work for me.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.240]   Imagine you all work for me.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.040]   And I'm going to give you a pay raise.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.360]   And I'm asking you, do you prefer $1,000 a month pay raise?
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.760]   Or do you prefer a $12,000 a year bonus?
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.480]   Not bonus, but the end of the year payment.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.200]   So it's fixed.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.240]   A thousand a month or another $12,000 at the end of the year.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.000]   Of course, the rational thing to do is to say, give me the money every month.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.840]   But when you ask people, how would you use the money?
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.640]   And in which of those cases would you feel more free to spend it in a way
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.320]   that would maximize your happiness?
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.640]   People prefer the bonus.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.180]   Why?
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.680]   Because people say if the money comes at the same cadence on the monthly level,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.840]   I will feel the need to use it on monthly expenses.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   I will use it on utilities and rent and grocery shopping and so on.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:31.880]   But if the money comes in a different cadence once a year, I would feel more free,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.040]   more liberated to buy a bicycle and go on vacation or do other things.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.080]   And all of this is to say that the way that the money comes into our accounts
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.320]   also helps us more free or less free about how we want to spend it.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:53.800]   When it comes to investing, what is our fund for fun?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.960]   Should we separate that from a regular amount and basically say,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.080]   with this amount, I'm willing to have a fund?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:07.560]   There was a couple that was retiring when I talked to them.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.920]   And they said that they just retired, like it was six months after they retired.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.680]   And they said that they're perfectly fine financially.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.120]   But they said they feel so bad about spending money.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.640]   So what I agreed with them, I said, take an amount of money that you want to spend every year,
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.000]   taking out of your investment, put it into your checking account.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.960]   I know it's not rational, but put it all in your checking account for the year.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.280]   And I said, if anything is left over, give it to charity.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.960]   So the agreement is, this is your money to spend.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.360]   Don't feel stingy, because at the end of the day, by the way, we want people to save,
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.520]   but we also want people to live and enjoy their money.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.880]   Life is not about dying with the most amount of money.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.160]   Money is about getting the most amount of happiness
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:01.480]   that we can from money, and not necessarily always, always saving.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.080]   It's about spending the right way.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:10.200]   OK, so we said that money is amazing.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.680]   It's about opportunity cost, hard to think about.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.240]   So we come up with all kinds of shortcuts.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.040]   And some of those shortcuts, like the pain of paying, like relativity,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.440]   get us to make some mistakes.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   And now the question is, can we do better?
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.960]   But what can we do to improve how we function?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.480]   So I'll give you a couple of examples.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:43.160]   Example one, you ask people, what is your discretionary spending for this month?
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:50.360]   How much do you want to spend on restaurants and bars and transportation and food
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.960]   and all the discretionary spending?
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.400]   People say, let's say $2,000.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.760]   And you say, here's a credit card, spend.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.280]   And people way overshoot, and they spend $3,000.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.800]   And then you say, you know what?
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.200]   Maybe don't use a credit card.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.560]   Let's use a prepaid debit.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.840]   We'll load $2,000 on a prepaid debit.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.240]   You can always load more, but that's what we start.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.640]   Now people get closer.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.760]   Do they get to $2,000?
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   No, but they get closer.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.000]   Because with a credit card, the number is going up and up and up.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.280]   With a debit card, it goes down.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.240]   And you see the zero.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.960]   But the problem is that people spend way too much in the beginning.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   You get to $2,000 in the beginning of the month.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.720]   You say, I'm rich.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.480]   And you overspend.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.920]   So we said, what if we broke it into four parts?
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.140]   Weak.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.520]   Turns out people do better.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.960]   Turns out if you give $500 a week, people do better.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.160]   Because you can see the consequences, the opportunity cost.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   And then the last thing we did was we said, what would it be better?
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.640]   To preload the money on Monday or Friday?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.280]   Which one do you think?
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.200]   Turns out Monday is better.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.700]   Why?
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.560]   Because if you load the money on Friday, the weekend happens.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.920]   And then people overspend.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.600]   On the other hand, if you load it on Monday, people look forward to the weekend.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.640]   They savor to have more money for the weekend.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.600]   And then if people miss, the weekend is the easiest place to scale up and down if needed.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.400]   So we can create better tools.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.040]   Like a prepaid debit card that loads every week and every Monday rather than giving people
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.680]   credit cards.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.440]   And there are lots of solutions like that.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.640]   That's one direction.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.560]   Another direction.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.280]   And I'll give you the short version of this.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:50.440]   But the short version is that I was in a-- Soweto is a big town in South Africa and has
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.640]   a very, very big slum.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.760]   And one day I'm in this place that sells funeral insurance.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   And I don't know if you know this, but in South Africa, funerals are people's biggest
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.400]   celebration of their lifetimes.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.360]   In the US, people celebrate weddings.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.600]   In South Africa, they celebrate funerals.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.360]   Weddings are very modest.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.320]   Funerals, that's the people's biggest celebration of their lifetime.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.480]   And of course, by the way, it's much more rational to celebrate funerals because with
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.560]   funerals, you know for sure you'll only have one.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:29.480]   So anyway, I'm sitting in this place that sells funeral insurance.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.240]   And this father comes in with his son who is 12 years old.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.160]   And he buys funeral insurance for a week.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:44.440]   Just to be clear what it means, it means it would pay 90% of his funeral expenses only
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.960]   if he dies in the next seven days.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.280]   Remember, these are very poor people.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   They buy a small amount of soap and a small amount of milk and a small amount of insurance.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.880]   They don't have a lot of money.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.560]   And this insurance place only sells policy for a week or for a month.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.760]   They don't have anything longer.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.800]   Nobody would buy those.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.000]   And he gets the paper certificate.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.760]   In a very ceremonious way, he gives it to his son.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.640]   And, you know, it's a kind of an odd thing to do.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.440]   And I start thinking about why the ceremony?
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:19.960]   Now, think about a poor father, very low income individual, who just happened to make some
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.520]   money today.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:27.240]   And now he's directing it towards funeral insurance or savings.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.520]   What will the family see tonight?
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.360]   The answer is that they will see less.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.920]   But at that level of poverty, there'll be something less on the table, less water, less
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.160]   food, less kerosene, less something tonight.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:49.720]   And what his father was doing was to show his son there's another economic activity
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.220]   happening.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.960]   It's as if the father said, you know, there's going to be less food on the table, but I'm
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.640]   taking care of you in this other way.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.440]   Now, we started by talking about the nature of money.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.400]   We said about what the technology do to the nature of money.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.840]   Technology also made lots of very important things invisible.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:16.200]   So 2000 years ago, before money, how did people save?
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.240]   Basically, with goats, chickens.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.760]   And the nice thing about saving with goats and chickens is you can come home from the
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.560]   office and you can see how many goats and chicken your neighbor has.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.240]   And we could compete on who has more savings.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.880]   But then we created money and then we created digital money and all of a sudden we took
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.480]   this amazingly important activities, saving, long term saving, paying debt, insurance,
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.640]   and we made it all invisible.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:49.400]   And we took this other important activity called spending and we made it very visible.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.680]   I think about the imbalance between those.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:58.120]   How many of you know something about what your neighbors are saving?
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.840]   Probably not much.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.960]   How much do you know about what your neighbors are spending?
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.200]   Quite a lot.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.360]   So this imbalance is making it really, really tough.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   And one of our questions, so we talked a little bit about spending.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.000]   We talked about how the methodology of spending and credit cards are difficult and so on.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.360]   But another element that is really important to figure out is how do we get people to take
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   more pride in savings, saving insurance, paying debt?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.720]   Think about this.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   All of those things are invisible, invisible and therefore not very motivating.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.640]   So we've done all kinds of experiments on this.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.960]   I'll just describe to you one of them.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:52.520]   Imagine that you go to a new workplace and you have 401k and you can sign up and you
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.560]   can save up to 10% of your salary.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:03.400]   Now, every percent you save in salary means bringing home one less percent.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.320]   At the end of the day, the people at your household will say thank you for the money
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.280]   you bring home now.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   In 30 years, they might say thank you for the money that you save for them.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.040]   But right now, there's going to be no thank you for the money that you are saving.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.000]   It's invisible.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.680]   Now, imagine what would happen if when you got this form for the 401k, you were asked
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.360]   to call your significant other and you were given a sentence.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.440]   Hi, honey, I'm in this new workplace.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.800]   We can save money for 401k for our future, for the future of our family and save up to
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.440]   10%.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.560]   What do you want to do?
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.920]   What should we do?
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:49.080]   Now, the person making the call is getting brownie points for saving for the family.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.520]   Now, would the spouse that got the call would remember this a year later?
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.240]   Of course not.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.160]   But do they get the brownie points at the moment?
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.120]   Absolutely.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.920]   And what happens?
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.480]   Saving rate goes up.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.680]   Now, this is not an easy struggle.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.560]   How do we make paying debt more motivating, more rewarding?
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.320]   How do we make buying insurance more motivating, more rewarding?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.600]   How do we get savings to be more motivating and more rewarding?
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.120]   Not easy to do, but it's certainly something we need to do.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.560]   We have to realize that this competition for saving is all the things that are visible
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.000]   and much more fun to do now.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.480]   And we have to kind of counter those things.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.400]   Maybe one last study.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.560]   In this study, you take kids on the day that they are born and you randomly divide them
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.280]   into two groups.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.440]   In one group, you do nothing.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.720]   In one group, you give them $500 in a college savings account as a gift on the day that
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.220]   they're born.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.520]   And you do nothing after that.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.240]   And you go to visit those kids when they're four years old.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.000]   And what do you find?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.360]   You find that kids with college savings accounts have higher social cognitive performance.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.520]   How can it be?
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.680]   Do these kids know that they have college savings accounts?
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.320]   Of course not.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.920]   But the parents know.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.880]   And from time to time, the parents get a statement that says, "This little kid already
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.160]   has a college savings account."
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.080]   And what do they do?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.600]   They buy a few more books.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.960]   They read a little bit more.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.680]   Is it a lot?
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:24.920]   No.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.320]   But is it over many years?
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.040]   Absolutely.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:34.440]   And what that means is that when we think about money and we think about savings, we
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.760]   really have to think about people's mindsets.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.200]   You know, this idea of taking $500 and putting it in a college savings account is not a
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.880]   financial thing.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.840]   It's a mindset.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   By the way, with this data, I managed to convince me and other people.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.160]   We managed to convince the Israeli government a few years ago to start a college savings
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.400]   account for each kid from the day they are born.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.840]   But it's not just a financial tool.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.360]   It's a mindset tool.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.520]   And I think the same thing is also saving.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.200]   I think we need to think about how do we make saving, paying debt, buying insurance more
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.760]   rewarding?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.520]   How do we make it more visible to ourselves and to other people?
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.880]   How do we celebrate when we get to a special point?
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.240]   You know, a marathon has an end.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.960]   Saving doesn't feel like it has an end.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.280]   When do you feel like I made another step?
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   Almost, almost never.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:31.000]   And then the other thing is I think we need to work a lot on giving money accounts,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.720]   different names.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.440]   Like college savings accounts.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:40.760]   Because these names are basically helping us overcome, basically increase our motivation.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:49.960]   If you have an account that is called my future fishing hut, there'll be motivation that will
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.320]   be connected to it.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.000]   And if it's just in your retirement account, it would, it would not be.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.400]   So we need to think about the mindset of people.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.480]   We need to think about the complexity of depriving ourselves at the moment for the long term.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.360]   Not easy to do.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.480]   And we have to help people.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:12.120]   And the things, some of our tools are to basically give those things name and make it more rewarding.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.360]   And I think I'll stop here.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.400]   And Alan, I'm happy to answer any questions.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.400]   That was fascinating, Dan.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.640]   Boy, could I relate to that credit card example.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.600]   I get 2% cash back on my credit card.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.320]   But I'm probably reducing the pain of paying.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.040]   So it's probably costing me a whole lot more than that 2% I save.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.720]   By the way, with credit card, there's another complexity, of course, which is that eventually,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.960]   you know, the credit card companies are not losing money.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:50.760]   As you know, the retailers are subsidizing it.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.280]   Right.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:59.080]   And there's a really interesting question of what is our relationship with our retailers?
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.600]   And do we want to support them?
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.720]   Now, with COVID, it was very clear that there are lots of retailers that we want to stay
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.520]   in business, that we don't want them to go under.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.040]   Right.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:17.000]   And I think we moved a little bit from this feeling of competition to a feeling, I want
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.320]   my local coffee shop to stay open.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.640]   I don't want in a half a year from now, when COVID is over, let's hope, I don't want this
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.440]   to be a desert.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.760]   I still want them around because the value that they give me is much higher than the
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.000]   cost of the coffee that they gave me.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.800]   And what we see is lots of people getting organized and helping local things.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.840]   By the way, the same thing would be if you move from using credit card to debit, you're
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   saving your retailer money.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   That's fascinating.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:57.400]   Speaking of pandemic, how do you think the pandemic has changed our views of saving money,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.680]   especially investing, with interest rates close to zero, stocks being risky?
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.800]   Have people explained why they're at an all time high?
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:14.920]   Yeah, so one thing that we see is we see many more people have open rainy day accounts.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.080]   So people are worried and rightly so.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.400]   It's a very uncertain world and people have opened, we see a lot of increase in rainy
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.040]   day accounts.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.000]   And one question is, will that sustain?
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.600]   Like if people open an account and they have a direct deposit, then it will most likely
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:34.920]   stay.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.840]   If they don't have direct deposit, it will most likely go away.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:48.680]   But in terms of the fluctuation of the market, so right now the market is all time high and
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.800]   we know about bubbles.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.000]   We know that when things go up, people go in.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.280]   And I think we see that.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.880]   But it's not a good strategy.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   I mean, it's good to go in if you could only go in when things go up and not go out when
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.600]   things go down.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.920]   But of course, we know that those things are connected.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:12.840]   The people who are basically following the herd, there's a strategy, the same strategy
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.520]   goes on the upside and downside.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:23.000]   So certainly more people are entering and putting money away.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.880]   But I worry that also more people would get out when we have the inevitable down at some
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.120]   point.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.440]   Basically, as you mentioned, loss aversion.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.240]   Losses are very, very painful, just very, very painful.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.280]   And when we do these risk surveys, how would you feel if your portfolio lost 20%?
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.000]   People say, oh, I would be fine.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.120]   No, no, you wouldn't be fine.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:01.080]   And what happens is people don't predict correctly how miserable they would be.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.960]   And therefore, people get out way earlier than they thought they would.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.840]   This is one of the biases we have to help people overcome, by the way.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:19.800]   You know, in self-control, we have all this literature showing what is called Ulysses
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.360]   contracts.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:26.760]   And Ulysses contract is a contract where you basically tie your hands so you can't make
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.960]   a bad decision later.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.040]   If you remember the story of Ulysses, Ulysses knew that if the siren will sing, he will
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.120]   divert the boat and kill everybody.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.240]   So he asked the sailors to tie him to the mast.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.760]   And this way he was unable to control the boat.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.720]   And he asked the sailors to put wax in their ears.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.800]   And this way the sailors were unaware of the temptation.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:57.160]   And I think we need something like that to help us with our emotional instincts.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   Like I would love to see a saving plan that you need a three-month warning to get money
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.360]   out.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.080]   I think that this idea that we want liquidity and we want to be coming out every moment
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.200]   is actually unhealthy.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.840]   That what we need is something that is a mechanism.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:21.720]   So, you know, we have lots of mechanisms to overcome our physical inability.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.320]   Like look at the chair I'm sitting.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.520]   It has wheels.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.400]   It has a cushion.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.920]   We take our imperfections and we build technology around that.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:37.160]   So this cushion, like people thought very carefully about my bum and what is the right
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.720]   cushion that I need and the wheels and the height and so on.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:46.520]   What about the imperfection of getting our emotions to drive us rather than a long-term
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:46.920]   logic?
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.200]   Now we could say deal with it.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.440]   But, you know, we don't tell people be cold resistant.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.480]   We build heaters and clothes and air conditioning and so on and shelters.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.920]   We don't expect us to be perfect.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   We build technologies that take our imperfection and get us to be better than we would without
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.800]   that technology.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:14.040]   I think the same thing is we need tools for the mind.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:21.960]   And this hypothetical example of a fund that you can't get money in less than three months
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.160]   is an example for that.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.200]   Right?
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.360]   It's saying here's an imperfection that we have.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.000]   Our emotions get activated, gets the best of us.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.240]   Let's design something for that.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.080]   I don't think it's like education.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   No, because the moment this emotion is ignited, people just take bad decisions and we need
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.760]   to make a mechanism that will make it impossible like Ulysses contract.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.560]   Fascinating.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.480]   Is there a way to help people imagine the pain that they're going to feel when their
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.960]   portfolio goes down by 50, 60 percent?
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.560]   So I don't.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.960]   OK, we can have a long discussion.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.200]   I hate these surveys.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.160]   How would you feel like?
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:12.040]   And I'll tell you why I hate these surveys, because your goal as a financial advisor is
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.480]   to make people wealthy and not to minimize their pain.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.600]   Like, imagine you go to a doctor and doctor said, Alan, how would how much do you hate
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:22.920]   pain?
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.400]   And you say, oh, I really hate pain.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.480]   So let's not heal you.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.960]   No, the doctor's job is to heal you.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.840]   And if you have pain.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.800]   Give you some narcotics in the meanwhile.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:41.720]   Like if I come to you and I'm loss averse, you should tell me so you should be poor.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.520]   You should say study yoga, take Xanax.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.080]   You know why?
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:52.680]   You know, the idea that if somebody hates losing money, what they should do is be poor
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.480]   for life.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.000]   I don't like that that direction.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.400]   You could say, Dan, don't look at your portfolio.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.560]   You could say, take Xanax, learn meditation.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.680]   You could do all kinds of things.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.560]   Why is the solution?
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.400]   Don't take any risk and don't make any money.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.160]   I mean, it's kind of crazy if you think about it.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:16.200]   So I think that the way we now talk about risk is kind of risk is a feeling.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.520]   The reality is that people don't take risk with money.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.640]   The reality is that people take risk with things.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.920]   At the end of the day, we translate all to money.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.040]   But at the end of the day, if I if I take risk, it's not how would I feel when I lose 20 percent.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:38.120]   It's what is my vision of what home I want and where do I want to send my kids to college?
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.800]   And will I be able to pay my medical bills?
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.920]   It's all of those things.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.320]   And you combine all of them into a risk version.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:53.080]   But it's not how would I feel, because it's about all of those other things.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:50:00.440]   Now, if we ask people about risk the right way, if you ask me, Dan, how important is
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.480]   it for you to send your kids to a good college?
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.040]   And how important is it for you to have at least a two bedroom apartment when you retire?
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.280]   And how important is it for you to have all of those things?
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   And then you said, what does 20 percent mean?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.200]   20 percent means that you're not going to do this one and this one.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.080]   Your kids will go to state school.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.360]   Good or not good.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.960]   That's what risk really means.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.320]   But but we don't I think I think when we do these surveys, we're a little lazy.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.880]   We I mean, the industry that asked this question.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   We kind of expect people to make the hard labor of saying, here's what I want across
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.640]   housing and education and charity.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.880]   And I'll integrate it.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.840]   I'll give you one number.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.800]   How would I feel like?
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.600]   It's a nonsense number.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   By the way, we have lots of experiments so that I can ask you the question differently
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.640]   and get different answers.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:00.120]   And so so I think I think we to answer your question, A, I don't like these measures.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.800]   B, I don't think we should minimize people's risk.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:09.000]   Is a feeling I think we should talk about your buying power.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.480]   And and what does it mean in terms of buying power?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.080]   There's an objective thing to it.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.120]   Like, how important is it for you to be able to sell your kids to Princeton?
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:24.200]   Or to go to a state school, if you say, oh, I I really want that risk, that's great.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:30.360]   But I need to help people do it in in a consumption context.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.960]   And I think if we did that, people would understand risk much better
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.880]   and be much able to report what is the right risk for them.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.520]   That's fascinating.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.120]   I don't think risk questionnaires are worthless.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.240]   I don't think they're that good.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.920]   I think they're dangerous because the way we felt about risk on February 19th, when stocks
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.880]   peaked was very different than we felt on March 23rd when they bought them.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.720]   And then even more importantly, they don't measure our need to take risk.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.600]   As you said, buying the richest person in the graveyard, not such a good goal.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:11.080]   So by the way, these these surveys are usually not asset dependent.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.320]   If you say I need six million dollars to retire.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:21.800]   And you reach six million, you should be have a very different risk attitude than if you're a two.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.320]   But but the surveys don't take this into account.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.960]   Anyway, it's a crazy thing that we're asking these things.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:32.120]   I think it's just for regulation purposes and to feel like check a box.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.800]   But nobody have given it sufficient thought of what what it really should be.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.980]   Terrific.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.080]   Jack Bogle, what has he taught you about investing?
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.400]   Anything that you'd care to share?
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.840]   So I would say three things.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.920]   The first one, of course, was, you know.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.600]   There's something that are unknown, like returns in the market.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.000]   And there's something that are known, like fees.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.800]   Deal with the things that you know.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:08.840]   I think the notion of not trying to outsmart the market is very important.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.760]   And I don't mean it's just important for investing.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.800]   I think it's important for the outcome because so I think it's also important for peace of mind.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:24.200]   I think that, you know, the people who are in the market need to be in the market.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.080]   But people like me who are not in the market,
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:35.240]   there's a question of how much of our mental capacity should we dedicate to our retirement.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.920]   And you can imagine it's something that can take lots of attention from people or very little.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   And for me, the notion of saying you can't beat the market to just invest in broad
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   funds is basically saying I'm accepting that I don't know.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.240]   I think there are people who don't know the market and think that they do.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.960]   There are people who don't know the market and know that they don't know the market.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.520]   And there's some people who know the market.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.160]   There are very few of those people who truly understand the market.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:13.000]   The vast, vast majority of people either don't know the market and realize it,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.720]   or don't know the market and mistakenly think that they know it.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.720]   But the realization that said, you know, this is not something I can out
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.160]   beat the market and all I can do, and this is really the important thing,
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.200]   all I can do is control how much money I put in.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.840]   So what I should do is I control the input and not the output.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:38.440]   I should think about how much money am I sending every month, cost based averaging.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.000]   And rather than saying I'm concerned with the output of that random stochastic
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:51.160]   process, and that's a very, very calming, very calming perception.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.960]   I think we have time for one last question.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.680]   And this was a fascinating one by one of the Boglehead members.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:05.720]   After reading your book, Predictably Irrational and seeing some of the cognitive biases we have,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.880]   he's noted, or he or she has noted that some Bogleheads claim that they are bias free.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:13.960]   They don't have any of these biases.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.920]   What do you think of that?
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.680]   So I think that's a really interesting bias.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.840]   So first of all, of course, maybe.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:29.720]   I'm not saying that everybody has those intensities of biases in the same way.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.840]   But we have a very hard time seeing our own biases.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.560]   We do.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.200]   And by the way, we should each go to our spouses and ask them if we are biased in any way.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.000]   I think your spouse will be able to tell you all kinds of things that we don't see.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.640]   So, yeah, you know, there are differences between people.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.800]   It's not true that everybody has the same bias.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.480]   But we are really not good in seeing our own biases.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.360]   And one of those, one of those biases that we don't, I mean, there are many of them.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:08.040]   But think about something very important, like our political opinions.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:15.480]   We all think that our political opinions are basically logic driven.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:23.240]   How could anybody else believe anything but whoever you voted in the last elections?
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.920]   But, you know, almost all of us are voting exactly as our parents did.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.280]   Now, if it was pure logic, it wouldn't be hereditary.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.520]   But it is largely hereditary.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.160]   Now, you ask me, I know I inherited my values from my parents.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.920]   But if you ask me the question of can I, can I, do I, do I give it all kinds of
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:52.280]   logical value and I can't see the logic in the other side, of course.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.920]   But I don't think it's really genetic, right?
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:03.240]   And I do think it's an example of a bias that is very, very deeply ingrained,
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.440]   that is very, very tough, very tough to change.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.520]   And I'll give you another example.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.440]   Conflicts of interest.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:18.920]   One of the best investments in the US is lobbying.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:24.760]   And the reason lobbying is such a such a great investment, but I'm joking, right?
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.120]   I'm not really recommending lobbying.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.320]   I think we should do something with it.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:32.360]   But the reason lobbying is such a good investment is because people are cheap.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:38.840]   Now, what happens is you meet somebody and you buy them a sandwich and a beer.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.920]   And in two minutes, they see life from your perspective.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:49.720]   And by the way, you know, a lot of these biases are really nice.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.960]   Like, you know, it's really wonderful that you can have a meal with somebody
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.400]   and get to be their friends, right?
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.240]   You remember the meal you and I had in that ski resort, right?
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.640]   You basically share a meal with somebody and all of a sudden,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.120]   it really elevates your understanding and caring and you see life through their perspective.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:13.160]   But you marry this with lobbying or your physician or conflicts of interest
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.280]   and it has terrible effects.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.920]   But we don't see those.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.760]   So I would say maybe they don't have biases,
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:27.400]   but my money is that they're just a little bit not so good at seeing their own biases.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.840]   My money is with you, Dan.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.520]   Dan, this was fascinating.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.960]   I can't thank you enough on behalf of all the Bogleheads.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.640]   Thank you for educating us.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.920]   My pleasure.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.360]   Looking forward to it.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.360]   I know you and I are going to chat in a couple of days.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.640]   Looking forward to it.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.140]   Me too.
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.800]   Very good.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:55.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
