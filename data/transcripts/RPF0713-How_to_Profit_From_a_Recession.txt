[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.840]   We are right now in the beginning
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.180]   of a significant recession.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.340]   Hopefully it's just a recession.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.480]   Hopefully we don't have to talk about
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.920]   how to profit from a depression,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.520]   although the basic concepts are going to be the same.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.360]   But we're gonna talk today about
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.520]   how to profit from a recession.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420]   And I wanna start to get you thinking about opportunity,
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.220]   because in the middle of every crisis,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.760]   you can always find opportunity.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.360]   You can find ways to improve your life,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.300]   to improve your business, to improve your income,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300]   to improve your investments.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.440]   There's always ways to improve
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.540]   every single part of your life.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.300]   And it's important that you always look
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.140]   for the opportunity in the middle of difficulty.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.380]   If you look for the opportunity in the middle of difficulty,
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.640]   you will often find it.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.180]   Whereas if you don't look for it,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600]   and you just succumb to the difficulty,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.820]   you will often just find nothing
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.920]   but bleak gray clouds all around.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920]   Every setback is an opportunity for improvement.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.660]   Every failure provides you
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.460]   with an opportunity for improvement.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.540]   Every single one.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.420]   Now that sounds just like some kind of platitude
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.620]   that you would stick on a card somewhere,
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.980]   but it's really true.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.960]   Every setback, every failure provides you
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.000]   with an opportunity for improvement.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.100]   One of my favorite sayings,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.900]   as trite as it may sound to you, it's real to me.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.180]   Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.900]   Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.300]   And so I want you to be thinking positively in this time.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.960]   I want you to be looking for opportunities,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   because this time may very well set the tone
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.000]   may very well set the foundation for your future success.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.360]   This time right now may very well set the cornerstone
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.200]   underneath your fortune.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   This time right now is when you need to be preparing for
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.160]   and planning for your comeback, if you need to come back.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.920]   Now I'm gonna say something here
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.480]   that is hard to say without it sounding arrogant.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880]   It's hard to say without it sounding a little tone deaf.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.780]   It's hard to say without it sounding,
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.200]   I don't know what other words, just a little bit proud.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   Please know that I'm not intending that to be the case,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.040]   but I wanna speak honestly with you
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.360]   and hope to inspire you.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.120]   I'm doing awesome right now.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.280]   I'm doing absolutely awesome right now.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   On April 7, 2020, as I record this, I am doing great.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.880]   My family is doing well.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.160]   My business is doing well.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.440]   My personal life is going well.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   My finances are in great shape.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.640]   I'm doing great right now.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.080]   But it's because of some of the experiences
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.060]   that I've gone through before.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now I understand that not everybody can do great.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.620]   I understand that not everybody has a business
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.600]   that can profit from a recession.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.920]   I understand that, I get that,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.560]   and that's why I said I don't wanna sound tone deaf,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.840]   but the reality is you need to recognize
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.420]   that you don't have to suffer in difficult times.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.120]   And so if you're suffering right now,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760]   I want you to learn and recognize from the fact
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.320]   that that suffering is due to some choices
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160]   that you've made.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.320]   You don't have to be suffering right now.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.400]   There are a few reasons for suffering
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   that are truly outside of our control,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.900]   truly outside of our grasp.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.100]   But most of the reasons we really suffer
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.280]   can be mitigated with good planning.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.360]   And I've done some things
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.460]   because of previous experiences that I've had
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.060]   that have helped to position me for this time.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.220]   I wanna give you some examples.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.620]   I started building a business in 2008.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.820]   I got laid off right at the beginning
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.140]   of the recession of 2008,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.660]   the so-called Great Recession.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.060]   That was when I got laid off.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.320]   And that layoff was a big surprise to me.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.620]   It was a real shock.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.220]   I did not expect to get laid off.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.460]   I thought, they're lucky to have me.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.820]   I'm Joshua Sheets.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.000]   I work hard, I'm a good employee,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.840]   they're lucky to have me.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.060]   And all of a sudden, they told me they didn't want me,
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.220]   and that was kind of a crushing thing for me.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.580]   Now, thankfully, I had prepared for that,
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.740]   and so it wasn't as crushing
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.820]   as it can be in other places.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.860]   But at that time, I didn't have a plan.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.780]   I didn't have a clear goal, a clear career plan.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.880]   I didn't have a specific list of things
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.980]   that I was working towards.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.540]   And because of that, I vowed,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.540]   I'm never gonna let this happen again.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.140]   I'm never gonna be in this situation
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.140]   without as many ideas as I have now.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.480]   I'm never gonna be in this situation
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.460]   without backup sources of income,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.420]   without backup sources of savings, et cetera.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.700]   And I resolved that I wasn't gonna be in that situation.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.460]   I wasn't gonna be vulnerable again.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.740]   And then over the years,
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.340]   as my responsibilities have grown,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.620]   in 2008, I was single,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.380]   I wasn't supporting wife or children.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.380]   I did pretty easy for me to survive in those circumstances.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.220]   But over the years, as my responsibilities have grown,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.060]   I vowed, I said,
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.180]   "This is my responsibility to care for these people,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.020]   "and I've done certain things along the way
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.960]   "that have helped me right now."
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.860]   So if you're scared, if you're hurting,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.960]   I want you to know that you can do better.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.260]   You can do things that are gonna protect you.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.820]   But I also learned some lessons through that period.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.620]   I met with a lot of people that were hurting.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.060]   I met with a lot of people whose businesses were failing,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.780]   but I met with a lot of people who were doing well.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.740]   I met with a lot of people
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.300]   who were capitalizing on the opportunities.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.280]   The 2008 Great Recession,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.660]   when I cut my financial planning teeth,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.340]   showed me that there are opportunities
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.420]   in the midst of chaos for those who are ready to take action.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.700]   And so I've been preparing, personally,
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.800]   for a recession for years.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.780]   Now, I was wrong on the timing.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.880]   I thought that there'd be recession in 2015 or 2016.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.940]   There wasn't.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.380]   Then I thought it'd be 2017.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.220]   There wasn't.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.040]   2018.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.880]   There wasn't.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.380]   I haven't figured out why I was wrong back then,
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.460]   and I think it's important to acknowledge that
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.440]   even in your own thinking.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.580]   As they say, a broken clock can be right, wrong, right.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.660]   How can you butcher a phrase like that?
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.060]   A broken clock can be right twice per day, right?
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.780]   So even if you, and that's the thing about recessions,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.540]   some people make a professional hobby
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.220]   out of calling for a recession every single year,
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.120]   and about once a decade or so, they're right.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.040]   My favorite old joke is that economists
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.440]   have reliably predicted all 24 of the last four recessions.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.260]   There's a truth to that.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.880]   Where it's easy to call for doom and gloom,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.320]   and yet it doesn't happen, well, people don't go on.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.640]   So I was wrong on the timing, but because I expected it,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.560]   I did some things in my finances
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.360]   that have insulated me for now, and I don't regret that.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.240]   In fact, I'm thrilled with it.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.600]   Another time, I'll talk more about some examples
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   of what I'm glad of, but what I've learned is
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.780]   that I used to think I was a big risk taker.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.740]   I used to think that I wanted to take risk,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.780]   but I've learned since then
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.700]   that I'm much more conservative than that,
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.740]   and that conservatism is expressed in different ways.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.620]   What I previously made the mistake of
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.940]   was I previously made the mistake of thinking
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.980]   that because I was comfortable with stock market volatility,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.900]   that that somehow meant that I was a risk taker,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.440]   but I've learned I'm not.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.500]   I'm a conservative individual,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.620]   and I don't see any reason to take risks,
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.780]   and especially as my responsibilities grow,
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.520]   it just seems more and more foolish to me to take risks.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.540]   So if you're hurting right now,
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.060]   recognize that there's some lessons in that.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.300]   The first thing that you should do is you should sit down
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.620]   and start writing out the lessons
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.820]   that are applicable to you.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.540]   I'm gonna give you suggestions and ideas
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.880]   and examples on how to profit from this time,
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.040]   but if you're not in a position to profit,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.240]   take heed and make sure that next time you are,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.960]   because recessions are coming along pretty regularly.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   It's kind of like the seasons, right?
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.760]   We're always going through seasons.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.400]   You've got spring, summer, fall, winter,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.720]   spring, summer, fall, winter,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.400]   and similar things happen economically.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.520]   There are cycles, economic cycles,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.660]   and if you'll work with those cycles,
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.100]   you can enhance your results.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.120]   Now, now that I've given some ideas
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.400]   for those of you who are struggling,
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.680]   let's talk about opportunities.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.400]   Some of these opportunities are gonna cost you money,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.640]   some of them are not,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.800]   but these are just ideas to spark your creativity.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.520]   I wanna begin with some suggestions for individuals.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.440]   What are some opportunities that you have to profit
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.000]   right now from this recession?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.960]   Well, I think one of the first things
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.160]   that is obvious to many people,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.580]   because of the unique nature of this particular recession,
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.960]   where work from home is not only encouraged heavily,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.500]   it's flat out required,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   this gives you the chance to try on
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.780]   a work from home lifestyle, which is awesome.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.340]   That gives you a real opportunity
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.220]   to get in there right now and say, do I like this?
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   Do I like working from home?
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.620]   For me, for years, working from home was a dream.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.540]   I had a dream from the time I was 15 years old.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.900]   I wanted to sit in front of a laptop
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.180]   and be able to work from an internet cafe
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.140]   or work from home,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.980]   and that was a dream that I had for many years.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.080]   But then when I achieved that, I realized,
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.460]   it's nice, does open up a lot of opportunities,
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.940]   but it's not perfect.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.760]   There are some things that are real downsides to it.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.020]   There are some things I really miss.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.580]   I miss going to an office every day.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.140]   I miss the camaraderie.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.820]   I miss the ability to interact with people
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.100]   who are not like me, just because I'm in a work environment.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.100]   I miss the separation sometimes.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.860]   I think it's healthier for my family
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.900]   if I were to go away to an office and then come back in.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.140]   It's a different lifestyle.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.980]   Now, on the flip side,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.420]   there are a whole bunch of opportunities
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   that are afforded by a work from home lifestyle.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.500]   It gives you tremendous flexibility in your daily activities,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.020]   tremendous flexibility in where you live,
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.600]   which opens up a huge world
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.380]   of incredible financial planning opportunities,
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.780]   everything from being able to live
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.260]   in a lower cost of living place
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.500]   to being able to live on the other side of the world,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.260]   work whatever schedule you like.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.220]   It's pretty cool.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.340]   But right now, if your job allows it in any way,
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.620]   you get a chance to try it on for free.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.100]   Don't even have to change your job.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.140]   This question is, do you like it?
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.700]   Do you like it?
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.320]   Think about it, embrace it.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.260]   Now, if you're still adjusting,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.660]   what I'll tell you is that what I learned
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.500]   when I started working from home full-time
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.400]   is there is definitely an adjustment period.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.700]   Don't expect everything to be perfect all of a sudden.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.160]   Give it some time.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.220]   But at this point, if you're working from home,
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   you've probably been working home for a few weeks
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.260]   and just test it out, see what you like.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.180]   If you like it, you may have an opportunity right now
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.620]   that is awesome to be able to make this
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.560]   a more permanent part of your lifestyle.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.460]   What I would commend to you is that if you have a job
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.380]   that allows you to work from home,
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.980]   and if you're finding that it seems like a good fit for you,
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980]   I would work day and night to be hardcore productive.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.340]   I would work day and night to be producing so much,
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.220]   so much excellent work that your bosses
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.580]   will never want you to come back to the office.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.020]   If you can prove to them that you get more work done
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.580]   from home, that you're able to make more things happen
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.600]   from home, you have the opportunity to make this
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   a more permanent part of your lifestyle.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.180]   So don't slack off.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.460]   Now, you're probably not slacking off
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.700]   just 'cause you wanna keep your job.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.620]   I think more and more of us are appreciating the fact
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.460]   that we still have work.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.120]   But the way that you handle your productivity
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.700]   during this time will provide you
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.380]   with more opportunities in the future.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.380]   So work hard.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.240]   Work hard to demonstrate to your bosses
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.320]   that this should be a regular part of your life
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.420]   and your lifestyle.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.520]   Because if you can get that, I'm telling you,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.720]   it's not perfect for everyone, obviously not,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.560]   but it is something that opens up horizons
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.060]   in a way that you would not believe.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.020]   This may very well be one of the big trends
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.500]   going forward in the future.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.740]   This trend that allows people to live and work
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.780]   from wherever they want to.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.300]   This may be the thing that kind of pushes us over.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.180]   People are predicting for a long time,
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.500]   everyone's gonna work from home in the future
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.700]   'cause we're all just gonna sit and type on our computers
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.420]   and communicate with one another, and video chat,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.500]   and video conference, and everything.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.740]   It's gonna come a huge way.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.620]   But the trends have been lagging behind it.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.020]   And in fact, in some ways, the trends have been
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.420]   the opposite direction.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.620]   I thought that we would move strongly
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.140]   in that work from home direction,
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.560]   but the trends over the past few years,
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.400]   especially with many businesses,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.360]   has been that they've been rolling back
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.780]   their work from home programs,
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.160]   rolling back the opportunities for individuals
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.000]   to actually do that.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.400]   This might change that, but it's largely gonna depend
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.120]   on how effective it is for you and how effective it is
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.900]   for you and your coworkers.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.040]   Now, if you don't like working from home,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.800]   what I would encourage you is take note of the fact
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.720]   that you don't like working from home.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.200]   Recognize, I don't like this.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.780]   I don't wanna do this, because you'll be a lot more happy
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.560]   when you do go back to the office.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.300]   You'll appreciate it a lot more,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.840]   which means you'll be able to bring more energy
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.380]   and zest to that work.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.360]   It's also, however, something that you should think about
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.400]   in terms of your future lifestyle design.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.540]   Because if you don't like working from home,
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.200]   are you really gonna like being at home full-time
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.800]   if you're working towards something like retirement?
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.280]   I ask you to consider it.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.280]   Next opportunity for individuals.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   I would encourage you, use this time as an opportunity
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.100]   to cut your expenses to the bone and see what that's like.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.160]   Now, I think this is prudent for all of us at this time
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.540]   of great uncertainty.
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.160]   One of the things that's just a prudent part
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.560]   of financial planning, when you're facing uncertainty,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.360]   cut back any expenses that you possibly can
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.260]   in order to hoard cash.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.020]   On a business level, this is difficult,
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.680]   because usually payroll is the biggest expense
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.520]   of most companies, and yet your biggest asset is employees.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.960]   And if you start cutting employees,
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.440]   that comes with all kinds of problems down the road.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.280]   But for individuals, those same things don't occur.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.720]   And what's really unique about this current crisis,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.220]   when we're all stuck in our houses and everything is closed,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.120]   is it gives you the opportunity to just simply cut easily.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   I've done consulting work with people,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.040]   say, "Yeah, my personal expenses are a little bit high,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.360]   "but we've got these nice lifestyle things."
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.020]   And I'm like, "Listen, everything's closed,
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.720]   "just cut it now.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.360]   "Cut everything.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.600]   "Cut your expenses to the bone, see what it's like,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.340]   "and then add back only what you really miss.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.140]   "Add back what's really important to you."
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.300]   Sometimes, one of the best strategies
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.140]   if you want to change something in your life,
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.500]   renegotiate some commitments,
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.300]   is to go through some massive change.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.060]   I've become convinced that this should be,
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.280]   in many circumstances, a primary strategy.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.480]   A lot of times, people sit around
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.160]   and they work for little bits of change.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.300]   I watch people, they want to get rid of stuff,
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.040]   and they go through this idea and they say,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.000]   "I want to declutter,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.480]   "so I'm gonna start with my dresser drawer,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.660]   "and I'm gonna do one thing every day,
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.080]   "and I'm gonna throw one thing every day."
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.100]   Maybe that works for you.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.940]   If it does, great.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.880]   I see that it does work for some people.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.200]   What I find for me is I find it very hard
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   to stick with one thing every day for very long at all.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.900]   I find it easier to just throw everything upside down
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.580]   and make some massive change,
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.480]   especially if it's a change that I want,
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.660]   if there's a reason for that change.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.820]   Sometimes, massive change, massive lifestyle change,
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.180]   massive disruption provides you with a convenient excuse
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.340]   to renegotiate your entire life.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.800]   And it's easier to tell people why you're doing something.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.680]   Let's say, for example,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.760]   you've been frustrated by living in a big house.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.180]   You've been frustrated by facing down
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.400]   all these mountains of stuff,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   and you've wanted to become a minimalist,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.580]   but your parents are gonna judge you
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.620]   and criticize you for being a minimalist.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.100]   Well, then all of a sudden, you get laid off.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.760]   Tell your parents, "Sorry, guys, I got laid off.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.080]   "I gotta get rid of all this stuff and sell the house."
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.760]   Gives you a unique opportunity
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.640]   to negotiate those weird cultural commitments that we have.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.080]   So use this as a chance to change your expenses.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.800]   It's good, prudent, defensive financial planning
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.000]   to cut, cut, cut.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.640]   Stinks for the companies, of course, but it's good for you.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.980]   And then add back what you really miss.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.360]   Could be a real opportunity for you.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   I've even done this,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.640]   recommended it to people even on an annual basis.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.520]   I don't do this much anymore.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   It's not necessarily,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.240]   I don't think it's the best way to do it,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.320]   but I've given the advice to people.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.880]   Just listen, you wanna change your spending drastically?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.400]   Call all your credit card companies,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.220]   report all your cards lost or stolen.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.160]   You may have lost them to the shredder today,
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   but report them all as lost or stolen,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.760]   and get brand new credit cards
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.600]   with brand new numbers issued to you.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.820]   And that in and of itself will just cut
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.640]   all of the expenses that are billed to those
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.360]   and force you to renegotiate everything.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.060]   And you'll add back the things that you really miss,
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.560]   but you'll probably save some money in the process.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.500]   So think about ways that you can use this to help you.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.280]   That's on the income side for individuals.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.440]   Now for businesses, some of these things have corollaries.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.640]   For example, for businesses,
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.480]   I think this is a really interesting time
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.500]   for you to try out the work from home lifestyle.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.240]   Does it work for your business?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.000]   Does it work for your team?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.440]   Does your team like it?
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.000]   Is it good for them?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.840]   I don't think it's good for all businesses.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.400]   I think there are a lot of businesses
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.880]   that even though they could work with kind of disconnected,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.280]   spread around workforces all around the globe,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.200]   it's not ideal.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   It's better for them that they have one physical location
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.520]   where people are physically working.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.160]   But I do think it can be a useful option for some people.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.100]   And so you have a good chance to test it right now.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.040]   At the very least, use this time of disruption
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.680]   to provide you with the opportunities
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.880]   to build those backup systems.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.160]   Even if your team can be in one physical location,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.000]   and even if that is the best thing for your business,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.700]   I think it's very valuable
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.760]   that your business have backup systems,
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.580]   that you have the infrastructure in place
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.760]   so that if your central business location were disrupted,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.600]   your employees could spread out.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.440]   That would be a simple part of a disaster recovery plan.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.000]   For example, a fire.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.280]   Let's say that you had a fire,
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.340]   just one simple building fire at your primary office.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.680]   Well, part of your backup plan for that kind of event
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   would be to have offsite data storage,
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.880]   would be to have a way that you could have equipment
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.000]   so that your employees, assuming your employees are safe,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.080]   your employees could go and spend time in other places.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.680]   So it can be part of your emergency planning.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.760]   Go ahead and figure out the technology that works.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.080]   In today's world, the technology that works
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.600]   when everybody's outside of the office
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.480]   is in many cases the same technology
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.680]   that you would use inside the office.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.120]   So use that to your benefit.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.080]   Use this opportunity to see
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.960]   how you could build a more flexible team
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.200]   even for the longterm.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.240]   One of the things that I've become really interested in
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.760]   is a business concept
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.200]   and have sought to employ in my own business
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.680]   is how can I make my business more scalable
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.540]   by not relying on full-time employees,
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.560]   but rather relying on contracted services?
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.720]   It's a really interesting option.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.680]   Can I use a company that provides me
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.320]   with a team of virtual assistants that work for me
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.040]   rather than individually contracting with one employee?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.840]   Because when I individually contract with one employee,
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.200]   I go through those phases of inefficiency
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.280]   where in the beginning,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.720]   they probably have more capacity than I have work
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.840]   and then you build up and you expand,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.640]   but that's a big financial commitment.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.080]   It's also just a big commitment of,
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.120]   it puts a lot of weight on you
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.720]   when you're responsible for other people.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.760]   So if you can use contracted services,
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.920]   sometimes you can minimize that financial commitment.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.000]   You could build a more scalable business,
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.420]   but you can also bring less financial risk to your life.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.320]   This I think could really be an opportunity
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.280]   for many businesses,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.560]   because if your business has the opportunity
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.260]   to work virtually and you're finding that that can work,
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.160]   then now you may be able to distribute your work
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.220]   around the globe.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.580]   You may be able to participate in labor markets
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.200]   that are much more cost-effective for your business.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.100]   And that could provide you with a more resilient business.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:45.480]   If you've got a labor force in a high cost of living place,
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.320]   very high cost of employment, United States, Canada,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   someplace in Western Europe,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.120]   and all of a sudden business starts to go down,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.940]   you have to cut pretty quickly.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.420]   But if your business could take advantage
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.180]   of a lower cost of living workforce,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.240]   then sometimes you can just afford to keep that going.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.380]   And even though you have excess capacity,
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.760]   the numbers work out better for you
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   'cause you have a more efficient business.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.440]   Think about it.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.420]   I think one of the big changes
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.480]   we're gonna be seeing in the future
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.960]   is a lot of businesses have been exposed
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.100]   as being overly reliant on China specifically.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.920]   They focus so much on one country
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.040]   that when one country shut down, it caused major problems.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.640]   And so it's an opportunity to say,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.560]   "Hey, that didn't work, let's change it."
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.160]   Now, in some cases, that means some American firms
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.220]   will outsource more to Mexico
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.500]   or outsource more to other parts of Asia
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.440]   or bring more jobs back to the United States of America.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.920]   I think it's remarkable if you look
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.840]   at what's happening right now in the markets,
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.160]   not talking about stock markets,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.240]   just simply what's happening in the flow of goods
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.360]   and services and the flow of capital
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.240]   and the flow of products,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.800]   and you see how exposed so many industries are,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.680]   it's remarkable.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.920]   And you wonder, was all of the efficiency worth it?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.240]   There have been people
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.300]   who've been warning about this for decades,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.180]   but I think there are gonna be some major changes
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.220]   because many countries all around the world
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.620]   are seeing how exposed they are
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.020]   when all of their industries
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.720]   are outsourced to other countries.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.300]   We'll see what happens.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.820]   Now, what about some ideas for you
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:31.940]   in expanding your operations?
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.260]   I think one of the biggest opportunities right now
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.260]   is to expand for businesses and for individuals.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.960]   You can either use this time and sit back
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.920]   and be filled with anxiety and frustration,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.120]   or you can make a bold, aggressive plan to press forward.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.660]   Let's talk about for individuals first.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.400]   One of the things, especially if you're laid off right now
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.760]   or you run the risk of getting laid off,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.560]   you should recognize that your safe,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.180]   secure job really never was.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.460]   I've always looked at that safe, secure job idea
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.420]   as somehow that provides security.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.360]   I'm like, you got one customer.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.380]   That's basically how it is.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.540]   If you're an employee working for a company,
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.860]   you've got exactly one customer.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.780]   And if you lose that one customer,
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.160]   you lose 100% of your revenue.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.780]   That's a very, very unsafe position to be in.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.600]   Now, not everybody is gonna go out
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.480]   and build up multiple customers.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.400]   Not everybody's gonna work for multiple employers.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.080]   I'm not trying to convince you of that.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.400]   But if that bothers you,
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.000]   the fact that you can lose 100% of your income
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.640]   if you lose one customer,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.340]   I highly recommend to you you choose a different path.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.740]   Again, not trying to brag, but I'm thankful.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.440]   It was built intentionally.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.920]   I was worried about that risk,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.520]   and I said, I don't want a business
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.200]   that relies on one customer.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.360]   I don't want a business that relies
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.580]   on even a couple of big customers.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.420]   When I first started in the financial planning business,
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.060]   I remembered I would get so excited about big customers,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.540]   and then something would always happen.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.060]   I'd have a big client or a big potential client,
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.460]   and they'd buy something from me,
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.580]   and then all of a sudden they'd cancel it.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.080]   They'd buy a big insurance policy,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.100]   and then they'd cancel it.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.900]   And then I'd have these huge clawback of commissions
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.540]   that would just totally disrupt my life.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.020]   And I came to the point, I was like, this is crazy.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.700]   I appreciate a big sale, right?
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   We all do.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.740]   It's nice to have one big customer
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.300]   who pays you $100,000 a year
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.540]   to show up 40 hours a week.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.380]   That's great.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.700]   But on the other hand, that comes with a lot of risk,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.820]   and it comes with a lot of pain
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.580]   when you lose that one customer.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.140]   And I said, I'm not gonna be dependent
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.140]   on one or even a few big customers ever again.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.820]   I want lots of customers,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.100]   so that, hey, if I lose 100 customers,
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.620]   I lose a tiny percentage of my business.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.820]   That's one of the things that I've appreciated very much
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.520]   in this current recession.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.820]   I've not lost business.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.660]   I've gained business.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.140]   I've gained a ton of business,
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.220]   partly because of having that wide platform
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.380]   where I have a lot of customers,
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.280]   partly also that I've chosen to try it over the years.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.300]   Once I realized that my strategy
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.420]   of serving the broke 17-year-old kid
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.020]   who I've always wanted to find my show and help him out,
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.580]   once I realized that that was a total failure,
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.500]   I said, well, I'll just go ahead and serve rich people.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.340]   And the great thing about serving rich people,
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.840]   and not being facetious,
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.100]   but if you serve rich people effectively,
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.720]   rich people always have money.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.640]   I would always recommend it to you.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.920]   If you're looking for an opportunity in your business,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.260]   it's just always seemed,
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.300]   I guess I learned this years ago probably,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.220]   again, in 2008, I read a lot of Tom Stanley's books.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.480]   At that time, he was a very influential person for me.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.320]   I read all his books.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.420]   And the thing that he pointed out
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.540]   is he pointed out how many times wealthy entrepreneurs
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.340]   would encourage their children
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.820]   to become service providers to wealthy people.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.480]   They'd be service providers of medical services
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.060]   or of legal services or of accounting services, et cetera.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.460]   Because there was a huge degree of security in that.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.420]   And entrepreneurs often recognized
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.020]   how risky the pathway of entrepreneurship really is,
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.020]   while simultaneously understanding
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.860]   that if you can serve wealthy people
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.020]   with those needed services, that'll be useful for you.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.220]   And that's been one thing that's been on my mind
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.740]   for over a decade now,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.060]   is that if I serve wealthy people,
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.900]   wealthy people are always gonna have money.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.300]   One wealthy family might lose all their money, right?
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.060]   They might have a legal issue and whatnot.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.340]   But if you serve wealthy people,
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.120]   wealthy people always have money.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.220]   And so it's a very valuable, resilient strategy
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.620]   that you can put into your business,
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.220]   is serve wealthy people.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.080]   And so my business has been doing well
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.940]   'cause I serve wealthy people.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.780]   And Joshua doesn't cost all that much
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.100]   compared to the value of his ideas.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.340]   There's a very good value proposition,
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.660]   and so it works well.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.060]   So think about how you can implement
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.780]   those kinds of strategies in your business.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.640]   Can you expand from here
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.580]   and start to serve multiple employers?
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.660]   If you've lost your job, yes, should you get another job?
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.820]   I think you should.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.940]   But maybe you don't get another full-time job
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.820]   that keeps you committed
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.540]   where you don't have opportunities on your own
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.060]   to go ahead and bring other customers on.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.580]   Go ahead and pick up a job,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.580]   but make a plan that you're not gonna depend
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.980]   on one company ever again in the future,
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.040]   one opportunity ever again in the future.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.860]   I think some of the lessons that we're learning right now
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.780]   are so valuable.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.180]   For example, let's say that you built a real estate strategy
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.940]   and you were building everything on Airbnb.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.460]   The debacle that has been Airbnb investing,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.100]   or rental market for investors over the last couple months
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.960]   demonstrates the real risk of non-diversification.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.580]   There are a lot of investors
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.780]   who are losing everything right now
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.440]   because their plan was to buy five rental houses
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.980]   and to rent them all out on Airbnb,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.660]   and that worked great until Airbnb imploded.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.900]   Now, will that come back?
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.140]   Probably.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.260]   Airbnb certainly has the biggest name,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.500]   but man, when Airbnb changed their cancellation policy
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.420]   and said that all of the Airbnb customers
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   could all of a sudden cancel everything
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.940]   and have all that money come back from the Airbnb hosts
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.500]   in what was, now, Airbnb justified it
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.420]   under their extraordinary circumstances clause,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.860]   but that put a lot of people in a tough spot.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.180]   So we gotta learn from these lessons
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.220]   and say that didn't work.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.980]   I need to be more well-diversified.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.140]   Now, in the middle of that system,
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.220]   look and see what kind of diversification works.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.900]   If you had a few houses in the suburbs
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.060]   of a not very popular city,
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.660]   there's a good chance that you have no rentals right now
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.900]   if you're in that short-term rental marketplace.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.220]   On the other hand,
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.140]   maybe there are locations where it does work.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.540]   So always think about what are the biggest risks?
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:45.260]   I've been astounded at the risks that we're facing right now
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.420]   just to continue on this theme of investing
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.540]   for just a moment.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   I never, never imagined a situation,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.140]   as much as I've thought about risk,
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.260]   I never would have imagined a situation
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.540]   in which states would say to landlords,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.140]   "You cannot evict your clients, your tenants.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.380]   "You cannot evict your tenants."
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.980]   And in which states would say,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.940]   governments would say to utility providers,
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.980]   "You can't cut off services."
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.860]   I don't know.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.500]   Maybe somebody out there thought of that,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.340]   but I didn't think we were in that kind of world.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.900]   Well, fool me once, shame on me, right?
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.740]   Or shame on you.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.260]   Fool me, I'm butchering, my apologies.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.140]   I'm butchering every single one of my cliches today.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.300]   Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.860]   Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.920]   I'm not gonna make that mistake again.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.700]   It's an interesting argument for crossing jurisdictions.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.980]   Right, it's an interesting argument
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.860]   where if most of your rentals are in Illinois,
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.540]   there might be value in having some rentals
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.580]   in Indiana or Wisconsin, because there are different laws.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.140]   If all of your rentals are in New York,
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.600]   you might wanna also have some rentals in some other places.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.580]   So you think about that.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.580]   But we're facing risks that demonstrate
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.200]   the importance of diversification.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.800]   So learn from these things.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.460]   Build bigger income streams, build wider markets,
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.840]   try to work in markets where there's a bigger moat.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.920]   That was the point I was making
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.700]   when trying to work with wealthy people.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.300]   Wealthy people always have money.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.420]   Maybe you work in a market that is essential, right?
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.020]   That provides you with certain benefits.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.620]   Grocery store owners are not going bankrupt right now.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.440]   That's good.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.580]   Gym owners are, right?
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.420]   It's bad to go bankrupt, but think,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.180]   is there some way that I could adjust this to lower the risk?
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.400]   I don't know if there's a solution
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.860]   for every industry, for every business.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.260]   In fact, I know there's not.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.220]   But I know that intelligent, thoughtful people,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.180]   when they face serious risk,
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.060]   can think about the mitigating factors of that
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.020]   and make better decisions next time.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.780]   Let me pivot to some personal things that you can do.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.680]   I've talked a lot about business here.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.300]   There's clearly an opportunity right now
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.340]   and in the coming days for buying good investments.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.720]   So right now, if there are investments out there
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.700]   that you consider to be fairly priced,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.960]   get busy buying them.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.980]   Buy investments if you consider them to be fairly priced.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.540]   I think that we should all have basically a buy sheet
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.580]   of here are the kinds of things that I want to invest in.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.620]   Here is a list of investments.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.620]   Here are assets that I want to own
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.380]   and here is what I would consider to be a fair price.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.500]   Now, the reason why most people don't think this way
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.900]   is because we're basically,
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.540]   a lot of it is just modern portfolio theory.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.400]   We're baked into the idea that the way that you invest
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.020]   is through a mutual fund.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.300]   You dollar cost average into the mutual fund over time
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.560]   and you buy and hold forever
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.160]   because the market is efficient.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.840]   I'm not arguing against that necessarily.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.920]   If that's your theory, then you should be buying right now.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.200]   But I've always been more attracted to the value strategy,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.100]   the idea of this is what I think
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.600]   the value of this asset really is.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.760]   Here's my argument as to why I think
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.360]   this asset is this valuable.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.680]   And here's my buy price.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.640]   And I'll buy as much as I can at this price.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.060]   Now, every investment has that kind of valuation
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.160]   that can be done.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.620]   You can do that valuation on a company and on their stock.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.720]   You can do that valuation on a piece of property.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.160]   You can do that valuation on a pickup truck.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.600]   You can do that valuation on almost anything.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.560]   You can come up with a formula and you can say,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.880]   this is what this is worth to me.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.720]   And so if I see this for sale at this price, I will buy.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:51.960]   So I'm looking hard for those deals right now.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.040]   Now, the markets that I'm interested in
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.080]   may not be the markets that you're interested in,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.680]   but figure out what markets you're interested in and invest.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.200]   There are deals now available
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.080]   and there will be deals available all around the world
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.680]   in all kinds of interesting markets right now.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   This is a time that you can get busy investing
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.780]   if you're positioned for that.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:20.320]   One of the things that I have,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.840]   one of the things that 2008 convinced me of
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.200]   was the value of simply sitting back and waiting
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.660]   for the investment markets to be in your favor.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.640]   Over the past years, I've given advice
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.120]   again and again and again to people.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.240]   And I've said, listen,
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.600]   don't invest if it's not a good deal.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.180]   Just sit and wait, stockpile cash.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.600]   There's nothing wrong with stockpiling cash
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.280]   and sitting and waiting.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   Because when I think about the outcomes
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.900]   of good investing for individuals,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.240]   what I observe is that you only need
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.820]   a couple of wins in your life to be set up really well.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.240]   You're not managing a mutual fund.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.760]   You're not managing a hedge fund
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.640]   where your performance is gonna be reported
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.080]   and compared to all the other investment managers.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.640]   You're just managing your life.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.280]   And in your life, you probably only need a couple of wins.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.840]   You need a couple of good deals here and there.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.880]   And if you'll put together a couple of wins
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.080]   and not lose big in the interim,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.500]   you can be wealthy and you can stay wealthy.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:39.580]   Meanwhile, if you suffer a couple of big losses,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.140]   those losses can wipe you out for decades.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.680]   Which is why I increasingly think
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   it pays to be conservative.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.760]   Now, that word conservative is not perfect
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.200]   'cause it's so subjective.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.440]   I think there are times that you go all in.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.320]   And there are times that the losses are not so significant.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.200]   And you gotta think about those things.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.420]   You gotta judge those opportunities.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.560]   I'm not saying don't take advantage of an opportunity
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.400]   when you see it.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.800]   What I'm saying is take advantage of the opportunities
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.280]   when they're there, but don't chase an opportunity today,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.600]   this month, this year, if it's not there.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.920]   It's a mistake that so many people do.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.480]   They buy, buy, buy because they have to buy, buy, buy
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.980]   instead of waiting for buying to be
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.620]   the clearly correct thing to do.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:25.460]   Again, I like to use real estate 'cause it's so intuitive.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.660]   But if you just bought, bought, bought because you had to
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.320]   and went all in on Airbnb, if you didn't have enough room,
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.640]   sometimes things didn't work out.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.600]   I'd encourage you, talk to some older investors.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.400]   And what I find in talking to older investors,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.680]   more experienced investors,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.660]   is they're often willing to simply wait,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.000]   to simply observe and to wait
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.240]   and to judge where we are right now, but to be patient.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.180]   I deeply hate using Warren Buffett as an example.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.900]   He's so overused and I think any financial commentator
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.660]   can use Warren Buffett to prove any argument that they want.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.840]   But I'm gonna take that bait and just simply say,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.700]   observe how much cash Berkshire Hathaway was sitting on.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.140]   Now, part of that was uniquely their problem
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.620]   that they have so much, they're so huge,
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.260]   they have a hard time investing their cash.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.160]   But observe how much cash they're sitting on.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.400]   Why should you run your life any differently?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.680]   I sound like I beat the same thing constantly,
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.020]   don't be scared to sit on cash.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.000]   But if I overuse it, I'm sorry,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.880]   but it's because it's a lesson that I had to learn
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.800]   and unlearn from the difference between what I observed,
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.900]   what I learned from kind of pop personal finance world,
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.040]   which said, invest, make sure you put your money
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.120]   into your 401k every month.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.880]   And what I observed wealthy people doing.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.360]   And I observed that wealthy people would just sit on money,
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.600]   sit on cash, they were prepared for opportunity.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.440]   And they would wait for those buying opportunities.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.200]   And I became convinced for myself,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.740]   I became convinced that the key thing to do
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.720]   was to always have the ability, have the dry powder,
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.680]   have the ability to pounce when you see a really good deal.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.560]   And a couple of really good deals,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.080]   whatever good deals mean to you,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.800]   a couple of really good deals can make you for life
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.960]   and set you completely financially free.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.920]   But you can't force them.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.020]   You have to wait and be prepared for them.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.800]   And I think you'll see that proved out in the coming months.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.480]   So buy investments if you consider them
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.320]   to be fairly priced.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.080]   If you don't consider them to be fairly priced, then wait.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.840]   Next, shop for consumption items.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.500]   Start your shopping now.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.100]   If you've got some consumption items
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.360]   that have been on your list,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.100]   now is the time to start shopping for them.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.780]   We don't know how long this crisis will go on.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.480]   We of course hope it'll be short,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.320]   but whether it's short or long,
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.120]   there are opportunities for you.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.560]   Here's what I see happening as of April, 2020.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.560]   I don't see a lot of weakness in the used marketplace.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.280]   I don't see a lot of weakness
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.880]   in the used car marketplace yet.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.620]   I don't see a lot of weakness in the used boat marketplace.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.920]   I don't really see a lot of weakness
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.500]   in the housing marketplace right now.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.600]   I think this change has been so fast
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.280]   that most people are just sitting and waiting.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.540]   Where I do think there's starting to be weakness
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.000]   is in the new marketplace.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.140]   So if you've been thinking about buying a new car,
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.480]   this is the time that I'd be negotiating hard.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.660]   The new car business has completely fallen apart,
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.720]   and this is a time that I would be going in
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.040]   and I would be pressing every single button,
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.940]   getting every single dealer competing with one another.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.220]   The new boat business, similar things.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.060]   The new RV business.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.480]   These businesses have collapsed.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.260]   And think about the situation
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.460]   that most of these dealers are in.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.580]   The dealer, what does he have?
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.980]   He has what's called a floor plan.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.900]   And so most dealers buy huge amounts of inventory on credit,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.300]   on short-term financing called a floor plan.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   And they'll put out huge amounts of money
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.220]   and sign up for huge amounts of debt
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.380]   to maintain what's on their lot.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.060]   They have to move cars in order to make that system work.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.320]   Now, there are different levels of conservatism
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.820]   that the dealers are operating under,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.740]   but they have to move cars.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.180]   What has happened is the shock over the last month
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.700]   has been so severe that the number of cars
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.940]   that they've been able to move has just utterly collapsed.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.180]   And those dealers are starting to feel
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.700]   massive levels of pressure.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.620]   They need to move vehicles,
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.420]   and they need to move vehicles to service their payments.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.380]   They can cut staff, they can cut positions,
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.260]   that lowers their outflow.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:43.940]   They can reduce their payroll down
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.260]   to even just a minimum staff.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.700]   What they can't cut without getting rid of the inventory
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.900]   is their monthly payments.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.100]   And so they need cash flow.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.980]   And so right now, if you've been sitting
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.260]   and watching and waiting and said,
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   "You know what, I'd like to have this certain new car,
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.140]   "I'd like to have this certain new boat, or this RV."
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.220]   This is the time to be negotiating.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.540]   And what I'll tell you is especially focus
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.140]   on doing that negotiating across the country,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.060]   or even across the world.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.140]   Go wherever you need to.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.620]   And hey, if you're sitting at home anyway,
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.380]   they're used to working with you virtually.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.780]   They're not expecting you to show up.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.300]   And so this is the time to work the phones,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.060]   this is the time to work the email.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.220]   Look for opportunities.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.900]   Now, I'm not sure yet that the new house market,
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.500]   that the builders are feeling the pressure.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.420]   I haven't been able to get a good firm grasp on that.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.580]   But if you're interested in building a new house
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.260]   or buying a new house,
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.700]   I would definitely be investigating it right now.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.100]   Now, what about the used market?
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.740]   I don't know that we're seeing a lot of deals
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.660]   in the used market yet,
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.460]   because I think the job markets
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.340]   or that people are losing their jobs, it's so new.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.860]   And I don't see a lot of people panic selling anything.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.580]   Now, maybe if you're shopping for something specific,
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.220]   of course, when I say the used market, what does that mean?
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.340]   Does that mean the used market in Roomba vacuum cleaners?
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.900]   Does that mean the used market in hoverboards?
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.980]   The used market in jet skis or private airplanes?
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.100]   What are we talking about?
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   Every one of those is very different.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.820]   But whatever markets you're interested in,
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.220]   whatever toys you've been looking to acquire,
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.620]   I would be shopping them right now
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   and seeing what those deals are.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.340]   Because I think that if they're not there now,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.700]   they're just gonna start to be there pretty quickly.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.060]   So get into your, well, if your local pawn shop is open.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.740]   When your local pawn shop opens, get in there.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.060]   For now, be on Craigslist, be on OfferUp, be on Facebook,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.660]   be on, what do the Canadians say, Kijiji, right?
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.740]   Kijiji, I can't remember if it's the, I think it's Kijiji.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.100]   Whatever your local platform is, be on those platforms
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.780]   and start looking around and seeing.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.140]   Because there will come a time
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.480]   when people need to start liquidating stuff.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.780]   And so start getting a sense
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.900]   of how long the auctions are out there.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.780]   That's the key to buying well in any used market period
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.500]   is to know the market so that you can understand
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.860]   where you are in the market.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.460]   So you can understand when you have the chance
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.380]   to press somebody, when you say,
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.080]   eh, well, I'll come back in two months
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.460]   and then I'll talk to you.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.540]   So you need to know the speed, the days on market
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.260]   for the markets that you're involved in.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.420]   So get started shopping.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.060]   You're sitting at home, get started shopping.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.620]   What are the things that would make your life,
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.220]   your family's lifestyle better?
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.580]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.180]   Questions are asked of me.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.660]   Joshua, why do you think that you should have cash?
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.500]   One of the reasons I think you should have cash
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.280]   is usually just for opportunities.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.420]   If you, it'll be very hard for you without a huge income
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.780]   to be able to live well now and also be financially free
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.500]   unless you get good at buying cheap stuff
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.780]   for a great lifestyle.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.580]   The typical, you should see some air quotes,
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.740]   the typical high consumption lifestyle
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.460]   is insanely expensive.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.400]   It's very inefficient.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.340]   Let's say that you have a dual income household,
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.840]   both income earners work jobs.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.780]   That is the single most inefficient possible way
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.460]   that you can set up your lifestyle.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.380]   You are absurdly highly taxed in that situation,
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.620]   both income earners.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.060]   So yes, you have good household income,
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.820]   but you pay a brutally high level of taxes.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.340]   You have no efficiencies in your personal life.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.620]   And so you often pay very high retail prices for stuff.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.300]   You don't have time or energy to make a lunch
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.980]   or to cook from scratch.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.880]   So you go out to eat all the time, right?
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.660]   That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.480]   You don't have time to school your kids
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.020]   or hire a private tutor in your home.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.940]   And so you put them in expensive retail private schools.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.460]   You don't have time to research and travel off season.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.420]   And so you've got to travel
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:36.780]   on the same schedule as everyone else.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.500]   So you pay high prices for airfares,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.720]   high prices for hotels.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.140]   About the only savings that you could do there,
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.260]   I guess, is do some credit card hacking,
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.880]   if that's your thing.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.060]   You don't have time or inclination
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.420]   'cause you're not that class of person
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.180]   to go and shop on the used market.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.140]   So you go and buy brand new RV
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.300]   and keep it for a few years
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.500]   and sell it and destroy your money.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.860]   You lease cars, you buy new boats.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.060]   All these things just destroy your money
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.340]   at every single level.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.780]   And about the only thing you come out
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.220]   the other side with is a 401k along the way.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.180]   Now, can you do it smart?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.060]   Can you avoid that?
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.100]   Yeah, of course you can.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.240]   Anybody along the way can start doing smart stuff.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.300]   Just 'cause you work a job
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.860]   doesn't mean that you have to go buy brand new RVs.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.780]   Just 'cause you work a job
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.500]   doesn't mean you can't do credit card hacking.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.180]   Of course, that's silly.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.800]   It's not either or, that would be a false dichotomy.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.580]   But there are a lot of people who are stuck in that world
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.140]   and because of it, they never get ahead.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.300]   Now, if you go into the world of the conservers, right?
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.860]   The savers, you'll often find
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   that they buy really fancy stuff,
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.360]   but the total lifetime cost of their stuff is less.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.100]   So let's say you want a boat.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.700]   Well, don't go to the boat dealership
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.280]   and buy a name brand boat.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.800]   Buy the boat with cash from the guy next door
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   who's about to have the thing repossessed.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.600]   And he just needs to get rid of it.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.100]   Buy the RV from the distressed seller
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.360]   who's about to lose it.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.040]   Pick up the car off lease.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.900]   But in order to do those things, you need money,
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.060]   which means you'll have to save in advance.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.480]   And so whether cash just simply means
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.440]   going and writing a check
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.820]   or whether it means $100 bills on the hood of a car,
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.840]   you would be shocked at the deals you can find
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.020]   when you're ready to move fast and ready to buy stuff.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.640]   So this is the time to buy toys.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.580]   Think ahead, buy the toys
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.800]   that your family's gonna benefit from
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.660]   if you wanna have toys in your life.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:38.960]   If you can cut the total cost of ownership on toys
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.420]   based upon getting good deals,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.360]   you can live a much richer lifestyle at a lower cost.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.080]   And it is entirely possible
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.040]   for an intelligent, thoughtful buyer
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.100]   to make money on almost every single toy
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.140]   they have in their life.
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.620]   It's a skill set.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.380]   I haven't been perfect at it, but I've been pretty good.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.060]   And I've always inspired by people
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.480]   who can make money on seemingly everything in their life.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.320]   So consider.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.660]   Next, use this time of stress and crisis
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.480]   to renegotiate your obligations.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.760]   Renegotiate your bills, your expenses.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.080]   Now those can be the big ones,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.340]   those can be the little ones.
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.060]   If you haven't picked up the phone and called your landlord,
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.260]   I would strongly encourage you to do that.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.660]   Pick up the phone, call your landlord,
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.820]   renegotiate your rent, renegotiate your lease.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.440]   Ask for a discount.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.320]   One of those major skills to develop
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.420]   if you wanna really be wealthy
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.540]   is the skill of asking for a discount.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.300]   Consistently, every single time, may I have a discount?
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.500]   If you don't ask, you probably won't get one,
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.660]   but if you do ask, you sometimes get one.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.700]   So call your landlord and ask for a discount.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.320]   It's very much within your landlord's best interest
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.120]   if you're a good tenant to have you.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.560]   So go ahead and ask for a discount.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.400]   Now you can leverage opportunities in your life right now.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.060]   You can leverage the fact that you're worried about your job.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.980]   You can leverage the fact that your hours are cut.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.460]   You can leverage the fact that your wife got laid off.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.940]   You can leverage the fact that your business is struggling.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.400]   Don't lie.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.100]   But you can leverage those things.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.940]   And just say, hey, listen, my wife got laid off
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.660]   or my hours got cut at work.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.900]   I can still pay you and I do that,
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.100]   but I'm concerned.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.660]   Would you be willing to discount my rent,
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.500]   at least temporarily,
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   until we see if we can get through this thing?
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.620]   That's a much better scenario than you're not paying at all.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.380]   So see, can you renegotiate your rent?
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.860]   Can you renegotiate your leases?
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.820]   Now clearly, those in the commercial marketplace
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.180]   are much more accustomed to this,
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.220]   but use it as an opportunity to renegotiate your leases.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.560]   Use it as an opportunity to renegotiate your mortgage.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.960]   Consider refinancing your mortgage.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.160]   Change the terms in some way that benefits you.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.400]   Stretch out the payments, lower the cost,
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.520]   lower your cash flow.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.560]   Renegotiate things right now.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.840]   Even your other bills.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.560]   Many bills, many service providers
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.280]   are offering relief right now.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.920]   Everything from relief on your student loans
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   to no early term payments.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.100]   No early termination fees for a contract.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.340]   Those kinds of things.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.180]   So go through and renegotiate all your bills
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.020]   and your expenses.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.860]   Standard practice with things like an internet company
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.180]   or a cable company is,
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.300]   in order to get, because of the way they are so dumb,
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.940]   they treat good customers like dirt
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.440]   and treat new customers like gold.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.620]   One of the best things that you should do
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.420]   is make a list of that once a year.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.020]   Call your cable company and tell them you're gonna cancel
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.140]   and get the cancellation department
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.660]   to see if they can offer you a new package
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.800]   to keep your service going.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.320]   Now that's a strategy in difficult times
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.740]   and in non-difficult times,
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.920]   but there's no reason not to use it right now.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.760]   Renegotiate everything.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.120]   If you've got a $180 a month cell phone bill,
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.840]   then say, "Listen, man, I'm gonna go to Mint Mobile
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.200]   "if you don't lower this thing.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.040]   "What can you do?"
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.640]   And see what they can offer you.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.420]   You don't know if you don't ask.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.360]   So renegotiate everything.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.440]   Consider what you could have done
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.000]   if you had known in advance that this was coming.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.920]   Consider how flexible you would have wanted to be
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.360]   if you had known in advance that this was coming.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:34.960]   Sometimes you're not gonna get out of the deal right now.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.340]   You're not gonna get out of the contract.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.280]   You're not gonna get out of the lease.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.520]   You're not gonna be able to renegotiate it.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.540]   But if you learn from this,
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.340]   next time you'll make a better deal.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.560]   So I think a good, you know,
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.160]   I start disaster planning in my
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.280]   How to Survive and Thrive
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.160]   During the Coming Economic Crisis course.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.140]   I talk about starting with bankruptcy.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.720]   That's your starting point.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.280]   Let's do bankruptcy planning.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.320]   Let's say that you knew
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.120]   that you were gonna be forced into bankruptcy.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.200]   What would you need to come flying out
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.160]   the other side of the bankruptcy ready to rebuild?
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.180]   So you start there.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.800]   That affects the types of contracts you make.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.740]   That affects the where you keep your money,
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.860]   how you keep your money,
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.980]   the forms that you keep your money, et cetera.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.760]   And then once you start with bankruptcy,
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.260]   then you could just a matter of going up from there.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.220]   Let's give you a simple example, right?
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.640]   Business loans versus personal loans.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:33.720]   It's never made sense to me why individuals go and,
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   you know, borrow money in their personal name
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.280]   to start a business when they could borrow money
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.200]   in the business name
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.320]   or in the very least segregate those business debts out
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.480]   onto a separate credit card.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.640]   That's kind of 101.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.480]   So assume you start with bankruptcy and say,
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.320]   how do I protect myself coming out of bankruptcy?
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.680]   And then begin with that plan in mind.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:57.560]   So similar things, don't sign up for balloon payments,
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.200]   right, things that could bankrupt you.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.480]   Don't sign up for personal guarantees
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.860]   whenever you have the choice to avoid it.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.280]   Don't sign up even for long-term commitments
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.760]   or long-term contracts when you have the choice to admit it.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.680]   That way of thinking, sorry,
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.760]   when you have the choice to avoid it,
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.580]   that way of thinking will help you.
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.400]   The entry-level consumer option is
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.860]   don't sign up for a cell phone contract.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.240]   Use a prepaid plan.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.400]   That way you can just drop your cell phone service off
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.720]   at the touch of a hat.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.320]   I've found that to be so helpful.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:32.040]   I fear I make too much out of a small thing,
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   but for a lot of people,
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.720]   especially a lot of young entry-level workers,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.000]   their single biggest bill is their cell phone.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.360]   And this turns into just a crazy bill
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.480]   where you have a phone payment,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.840]   so you're making payments on a device that was expensive,
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.360]   and then you have a service payment
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.340]   that you're often locked into with a contract
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.000]   with a big hairy early termination fee.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.600]   Well, what happens if you get laid off?
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.320]   You lose the phone, you lose the service,
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.400]   you harm your credit sometimes,
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.640]   and now you don't have a phone
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.480]   which is gonna be one of your
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.560]   most valuable communication tools.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.880]   Now I believe that that phone
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   is probably one of the first things that you should buy.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.660]   If I were flat broke, completely broke,
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.520]   I would probably, I would skip meals
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.500]   until I could get a functional phone
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.200]   because that communication device opens up a world to you.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.120]   It's hard to get a job
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.280]   if you don't have a stable phone number.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.120]   But that doesn't mean that you have to be locked in.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.880]   Over the years, what I've done
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.800]   is I've moved everybody away from phone calls
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.560]   over to messaging apps.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.620]   This is kind of a funny thing,
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.240]   just a little bit of cultural insight
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.920]   into the United States versus much of the rest of the world.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   The United States functions on phones and phone systems.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.640]   Most of the world functions on apps, primarily WhatsApp.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.680]   And there's an interesting anthropological reason for this.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.240]   If you go back, and this is my analysis,
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.280]   I've never read this anywhere, it's just my opinion.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.840]   Feel free to disprove it if you want,
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.800]   but this is just Joshua observing the marketplace
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.820]   and thinking about why this exists.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.700]   But in the United States,
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.560]   you had an early adoption of telephone infrastructure.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.560]   You had the invention of the telephone,
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.240]   then the widespread installation of it.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.800]   And so the US American economy spent millions,
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.640]   billions probably of dollars,
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.760]   connecting everybody with a phone line.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.400]   But that phone infrastructure
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.600]   was specifically wired phone infrastructure.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.280]   And everybody got used to using their home phones.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.240]   So back in the early days of cell phones,
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.080]   when I was in high school,
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.040]   in the late '90s and the early 2000s,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.320]   you would call somebody on their cell phone,
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.840]   but it was considered very bad taste
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.480]   to call somebody for a long conversation.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.000]   You would call them if necessary,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.360]   but you always moved to a home phone
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.680]   because the home phones were a lot cheaper.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.440]   Even the home phones, though, were expensive.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:48.340]   I love reading old books on saving money,
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.380]   and I'll always chuckle when you read somebody
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.400]   talk about saving money
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.780]   because if you can buy a first-class stamp
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.840]   and send somebody a letter in the mail
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.000]   using a first-class stamp,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.560]   it was cheaper than making a long-distance phone call.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.000]   It just seems so antiquated now,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   but it was the real advice back then.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.840]   That was the personal finance advice that made a difference.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.420]   Well, in much of the world,
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.100]   that wired infrastructure was never installed,
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.480]   but there was an immediate leap to wireless.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.180]   And this has made a huge difference in many markets.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.800]   Many wide parts of Africa and some of Southeast Asia,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.960]   some of the Americas,
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.560]   they just completely skipped all the cost and expense
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.600]   of installing this massive wired infrastructure,
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.540]   and they went straight to cell phones,
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.280]   which was awesome for their ability
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.860]   to quickly get connected.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.560]   Really helped out many of the local people
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.440]   to gain access to the world of information.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.780]   But because of that, they started with cell phones.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.180]   So Americans always have needed this interplay
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.120]   between cell phones and wired phone connections,
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.780]   but most other individuals had cell phones.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.040]   And then very quickly, once data,
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.400]   once the smartphone came out,
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.040]   and then once data became more widely available,
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.840]   they realized, due to the need to conserve money
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.600]   and conserve costs,
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.240]   they realized that data was more efficient
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.000]   than voice communication, than text.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.840]   This was back in the days
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.440]   when you would pay 10 cents per text message, et cetera.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.400]   Data was a lot more efficient.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.320]   And so apps, communication apps, like WhatsApp,
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.120]   came to prominence very, very quickly,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.320]   and everybody moved to that,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.240]   and that became the standard system.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.800]   And so to this day, outside of the United States
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.120]   and outside of Western Europe,
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.780]   you'll often see that a business will put its WhatsApp number
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.040]   on the door of its store,
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.340]   and that's considered normal to ask somebody.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.720]   People answer their WhatsApp number
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.880]   even if they don't recognize the number.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   They respond to the messages.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.680]   And so what that means, though,
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.240]   is because WhatsApp is a service
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.440]   where you're not charged for the use of it,
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.580]   and because it only connects to data,
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.220]   then people have a much thinner relationship
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.360]   with their cell phone provider,
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.080]   'cause they're not tied necessarily to one number.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.200]   You can have a WhatsApp phone issued in one specific number,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.480]   and you can keep that number for years
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.600]   even if you don't keep that number alive.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.200]   And so a little bit of an aside there.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.640]   Hope you enjoyed kind of the insight
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.040]   into the development of it.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:07.880]   You can understand, though,
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.200]   the anthropology of this movement.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.480]   And what you can see is in the United States,
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.780]   if you can move away from the phone number,
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:19.040]   then you have the opportunity to lower those expenses.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.920]   And so you can cut out a very significant cost
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.740]   for young people.
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.000]   Now, if I'm running a business,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.560]   not a chance in the world I'm gonna try to make do
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.500]   with kind of cobbled together phone systems and cheap stuff.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.040]   Man, give me good service, give me stability, et cetera.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.960]   I'm not gonna try to run a business from pseudo app.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.080]   Not gonna work.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:43.720]   But for somebody who's an entry-level worker,
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.120]   not earning a lot of money,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.920]   the ability to keep communications
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:51.360]   but cut $150 out of their phone bill is a huge deal.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.780]   But that exact same principle applies at a different scale.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.940]   At a much higher scale,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.680]   it's a matter of negotiating your leases
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.040]   and thinking, what if I had to cut this lease out right away?
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.320]   How would I do it?
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.420]   It's a matter of negotiating your employment contracts
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.760]   and saying, what's the total cost?
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.120]   How can I shorten this up so that we can be more nimble?
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.060]   It's a matter of thinking about your infrastructure
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.280]   and how you design your business.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.760]   And that's too complex for me to give example after example,
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.320]   but it's the same level of thinking,
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.220]   just applied at a different scale
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:26.220]   with a different number of zeros behind.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:30.980]   Think through what you'd like to do.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.560]   For me, over the years, when I thought about that stuff,
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.440]   I realized that I was nervous.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.880]   I didn't, kind of allergic to the idea
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.680]   of being in a situation
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.520]   where I have a lot of long-term contracts.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.920]   The thing I didn't like about debt
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.960]   was I wasn't able to pivot quickly.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.480]   And so if I avoid it, then I can still pivot quickly.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.600]   The same thing applies to long-term leases,
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.040]   long-term commitments, contracts, et cetera.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:58.880]   I'd personally rather pay a little bit more
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:04.160]   in order to have the flexibility of canceling early
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.120]   rather than be committed for the long-term.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.480]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.260]   Close with this.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:16.400]   Think through this current disaster
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.400]   and think about what you'd like to have
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.020]   if this were really bad.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.820]   I think we're gonna avoid the worst case scenario.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.160]   My best guess at the moment
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.320]   is I think the medical issues are demonstrating themselves
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.880]   that they can be brought under control.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.200]   And at the moment, we don't know
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.280]   what the economic impacts are gonna be,
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.240]   but we're probably gonna avoid
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.880]   kind of the long-term worst case scenario.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.680]   It's still hard to know.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.280]   Another few weeks, we're gonna tell the story,
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.560]   but I'm getting the distinct impression
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.520]   that people are less scared of the virus
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.760]   than they were previously
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.160]   and that they're pretty much done with being shut down.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.560]   And so I think that,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.640]   although I don't know what that solution is gonna be,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.340]   I think it's probably gonna be widespread testing,
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:07.400]   antibody testing, and active infection testing.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.120]   I think that's probably gonna be the solution
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.800]   with more isolation for the at-risk.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.760]   That just seems like the most sensible solution
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.440]   and everybody else try to get back to work.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.120]   If that happens, I think this could be
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.880]   more of a more normal run-of-the-mill deep hard recession
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   rather than just global catastrophe.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.680]   I'm still hoping, maybe it's just wishful thinking,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.640]   but I'm still hoping that we avoid
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.720]   the global catastrophe scenario.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.760]   But I've been taking notes
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.640]   because I could still see
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.860]   that global catastrophe scenario happening.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.500]   And it's remarkable to me how fast it happened.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.920]   And so I've been taking notes.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.160]   All right, what would I need if this were really bad?
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.560]   How do I feel right now?
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.480]   You know, what am I learning from the situation?
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.560]   I was chatting with somebody recently,
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.040]   said, you know, the $100,000 emergency fund
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.560]   is gonna be the status symbol of choice
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.400]   for the next generation.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.860]   When all of a sudden you realize
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:09.060]   that we can go from practically zero, not actually zero,
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:13.060]   but very low unemployment numbers, a few percent,
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.740]   you know, practically 0% unemployment,
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.980]   up to 30% unemployment overnight in a few weeks,
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:21.380]   I never imagined that was possible.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.760]   I never imagined that.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.940]   But I'm gonna imagine it going forward.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.220]   All of a sudden now a three-month emergency fund
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.100]   or a six-month emergency fund
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.360]   just doesn't seem so robust.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:38.700]   I used to recommend it 'cause that was the CFP
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.060]   accepted standard, three-month emergency fund
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.180]   for dual income earners
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.580]   or six months for single income earners.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.420]   Well, I've not been quite comfortable with that for a while,
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.980]   but I mean, with the number of children I got,
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.740]   three months just doesn't seem all that robust anymore.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.900]   Maybe it's different for you.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.220]   So maybe you say, you know,
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.680]   my target is now a 12-month emergency fund.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.220]   I sleep better at night.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.780]   I don't worry, I don't have anxiety.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.100]   I have processed this event far differently
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.580]   than many other people have
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.260]   because I don't have any anxiety
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.340]   about the financial ramifications of it.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.100]   I'm well-prepared for it.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.820]   Again, not bragging, just trying to say
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.100]   that the decisions that you make today
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.220]   are gonna make a big difference
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.460]   in how you experience the next crisis.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.760]   And there's always going to be a next crisis.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.380]   And so that sense of peace, that sense of robustness
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.900]   in my business and my personal finances
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.300]   allows me to be at total peace
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.620]   and to focus on how am I gonna turn this thing out?
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.500]   How am I gonna serve millions of people?
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.900]   How am I gonna win?
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.700]   And those are pretty cool.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.380]   I think you should take seriously the lessons
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.620]   that you're learning from your investment portfolio.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.940]   I'll admit something that is not particularly popular,
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.740]   but it's something I've experienced.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.260]   I've learned that I haven't been sad
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.140]   to not own mass market stock mutual funds.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:04.520]   I haven't missed it, which was a strange revelation for me
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.500]   because I used to make a business out of training investors
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.480]   not to bail when times are bad.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.460]   I was never scared of volatility.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.980]   And my entire business as an investment manager
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.420]   was predicated upon the value proposition
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.400]   of helping people stay invested
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.220]   when everything within them is screaming,
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.100]   sell, sell, sell, sell.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.100]   But I haven't been out of that business for six years now,
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.580]   or six years.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.180]   I haven't owned stock mutual funds
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.140]   in probably four years, I guess, three or four years.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.580]   And it's been fascinating to just sit back
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.900]   with a kind of detached perspective.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.900]   And honestly, I've had to reassess.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.580]   I'm like, why put up with that stuff?
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.660]   Like, why put up?
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.940]   Everyone says, and if I were Nick Murray,
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.660]   I'm not subscribed to Nick Murray's newsletter right now,
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.460]   but I used to subscribe to his newsletter.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:59.460]   Right now, Nick Murray is guaranteed writing articles
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.500]   about how strong the American companies are
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.620]   on a global basis where they have this global income stream,
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.460]   et cetera.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.280]   And is it true?
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.440]   It's absolutely true.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.880]   But are these companies so fragile
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.980]   that they couldn't make it through a few weeks?
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.060]   Right, is Delta Airlines so poorly managed
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.420]   that they couldn't make it through three weeks
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.580]   with a shutdown?
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.500]   Now, I concede that an 80% decrease in traffic
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.900]   is a big, big decrease,
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.300]   and it's very hard to prepare for that.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.380]   But when you have year after years after years
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.780]   after years of making profit,
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.060]   like don't any of them set aside any money?
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.600]   Don't any of them save money?
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.540]   I think the millennial complaint is exactly right.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:46.380]   You know, everyone says,
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.940]   well, buy a little bit less avocado toast,
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.780]   and all of a sudden you'd be able to save some money.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.500]   Well, maybe if you save a little bit of money, companies,
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.300]   you wouldn't need such a fast bailout.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.100]   What a crazy system.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.820]   Now, I'm happy to accept
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.280]   that your rationality of the markets,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.820]   I'm happy to accept the unknowns.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.900]   Like, it's fine.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.820]   I think there's opportunities,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.660]   and I'm not, I think there are opportunities
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.380]   to profit long-term.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.020]   I haven't missed the volatility.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.020]   That's all I'm saying, just sharing my personal experience.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.020]   I haven't missed it.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:20.700]   Because it's such an opaque market to individuals
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.980]   that you can see the trades sometimes,
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.860]   but it just seems to me almost
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.360]   infinitely easier to run your own business,
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.680]   to be involved in your own scenario,
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.940]   where the market trends are more understandable to you.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:46.000]   I realized that, you know, I wish I had more gold.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.400]   One of, you know, it's the untalked about scenario,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.840]   and I own more gold than the average person, certainly,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.080]   but one of the things I realized,
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.640]   like, I wish I owned more gold.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.140]   It feels good in times of crisis to have assets
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.220]   that are not so determined by, you know,
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.140]   this crazy scenario.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.820]   It feels good to have assets that can move easily around.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.720]   So, you know what?
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.400]   I always felt crazy for buying gold,
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.580]   but I wish I had more gold.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.420]   There's an interesting investment argument,
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.220]   and there's just something about it.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.300]   Is it illogical?
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.180]   I think it is sometimes.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.860]   I think people have this illogical connection to it,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.860]   but is it real?
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.620]   It's no less real than anything else.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.480]   You know, I've talked to a number of people every now
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.420]   and then, 'cause I talk publicly about owning gold.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.360]   I talk sometimes to portfolio managers and whatnot,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.440]   and we talk about gold investing,
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.640]   and often I'll get people to invest,
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.240]   to admit to me privately every now and then.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.520]   So I'm like, you know, I bought my first gold coin,
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.720]   and I sat there, and I held the thing,
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.860]   and you know what?
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.280]   I realized I like this.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.600]   I don't wanna sell it.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.580]   It feels good.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.480]   And I never got that responsibility,
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.480]   that same emotion from owning a share of a company
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:08.760]   as I got from owning that physical coin,
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.000]   that one ounce gold coin.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.080]   Now, again, the logical side of my brain says,
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.880]   all right, Joshua, red alert,
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.320]   logical fallacy coming right up.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.160]   Pay attention.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.680]   This is probably not something that you should invest
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.760]   based upon emotions and feelings, but it's really true.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.920]   Those emotions and feelings matter.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.160]   And over the years, one of the ways
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.520]   that I've matured as a financial planner
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.880]   is I've come to take those emotions
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.520]   and feelings very seriously.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.080]   I used to tell people,
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.720]   oh, you shouldn't pay attention to your emotions.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.000]   You should educate yourself
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.320]   into a more enlightened position.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.680]   And then I started to have clients have bad experiences,
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.200]   and to these days, I've learned,
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.120]   like, dealing with the emotions is one of the first things
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.660]   to think about.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:53.040]   So just evaluate what you wish you'd do.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.120]   I have more stuff on my list than that.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.960]   In fact, I got a big list of things where I'm like,
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.160]   you know what, I'd really like to have that right now.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.720]   I won't go into that detail here, maybe another time,
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.280]   but for now, those things are things I wanna keep private.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.560]   But just evaluate, what do you wish you had right now?
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.960]   What do you wish you needed?
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.840]   If you've got a toilet paper shortage in your house,
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.160]   do you wish you had toilet paper?
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.080]   If so, pretty soon, it'll be easy for you to stock up.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.080]   Right now, you can buy all the commercial paper you want.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.640]   Just go get commercial rolls of toilet paper
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.060]   so at least you have the stuff.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.480]   But then in the future, just figure out
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.880]   how much toilet paper you always wanna have on hand,
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.760]   and then make sure you never go below that
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.040]   in your margin of toilet paper.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.360]   If it's a month, great, have a few packages.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.480]   If it's three months, whatever you use, just do that.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.160]   Do you not feel stupid for the fact
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.400]   that you're a millionaire,
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:42.300]   and yet you can't lay your hands on toilet paper right now?
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.840]   Forgive my harsh language,
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.980]   but that's the lesson to grasp from it.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.420]   Do you not feel short-sighted for the fact
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   that I've got thousands of dollars,
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.620]   I've got thousands of dollars,
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.700]   but I can't get toilet paper?
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.580]   This thing that I use every single day,
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.240]   do you not feel short-sighted for the fact
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.740]   that you're a thousandaire, or a 10,000aire,
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.940]   or a 100,000aire, or a millionaire,
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.480]   and you can't lay your hands on that?
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.340]   Which makes a bigger difference in your quality of life?
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.500]   The fact that you have an extra $523 in your 401(k)
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.200]   because you put your 401(k) before everything?
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.760]   Or the fact that your wife has plenty of toilet paper?
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.120]   If you feel exposed from the fact
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.560]   that you're a wealthy person,
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.980]   but you can't get your hands on toilet paper right now,
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.040]   you should feel exposed, and you should fix that.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.620]   But I think also what's interesting is right now,
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.660]   I think evaluate where you live, right?
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.220]   Evaluate your neighbors, your neighborhood,
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.560]   your house, et cetera.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.380]   Evaluate who you live with,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.160]   what that environment is like.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.140]   I hope you don't wind coming out of this crisis
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:55.980]   where you're stuck at home.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.980]   I hope you don't come out hating your kids,
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.260]   hating your wife, and I hope you don't wind up
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.340]   in divorce court after this.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.660]   People make jokes about it, but I think it's really sad.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.120]   I hope you really like the people that you like,
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.060]   but I'll tell you this, if you don't like your children,
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:12.040]   whose responsibility is that?
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.340]   If you don't like your children,
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.940]   why do you expect anybody else to like your children?
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:29.780]   Heard a parenting quote a number of years ago.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.300]   I don't know if it's true or not,
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.020]   but it had a ring of truth to it.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.660]   It was expressing something I think that's important.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:41.820]   You should train and discipline your children
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.960]   until you like them.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.580]   So if you find that you're spending hours and hours
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.740]   and hours a day with your children,
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.140]   and all of a sudden you don't like them anymore,
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.620]   that better be your goal, is to say,
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.620]   how can I change my practices as a father,
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.860]   as a mother, so that I like my children,
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.960]   so that I want to spend my time with them?
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.280]   Why is it that they become these creatures
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.500]   that I don't wanna be around?
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.020]   That is not normal.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.900]   (silence)
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.540]   If that's been your experience, I urge you,
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:28.540]   examine the fact that that is not normal,
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:33.180]   and it's your responsibility to change that.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:37.060]   What about your relationship with your wife,
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.340]   with your husband?
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:41.740]   If you don't like being at home
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.460]   and spending time with them now,
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.380]   why do you think you're gonna like being at home
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.980]   and spending time with them when you start your own business
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.000]   when you retire?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.860]   If you don't like being with them in your house,
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   are you really gonna like traveling the world with them
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.700]   when you're old and rich and retired?
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.340]   Now, I would recommend you not trade them in
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.200]   for a newer model.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.900]   I don't think that's a good plan.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.500]   I think the better plan is,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.860]   fall in love with them all over again,
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.460]   and help them fall in love with you all over again.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.620]   (silence)
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.980]   Is it easy?
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.900]   No, it's not easy.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   But is it worth it?
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.120]   I think it really is.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.220]   You can build a relationship into anything that you want.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.040]   That's your responsibility.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.140]   So can the stress exacerbate things?
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:38.980]   It can.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.280]   I'm not immune to that stress.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.380]   Neither are you.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.140]   We're all subject to it.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.940]   And I'm not trying to be excessively idealistic.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.000]   But there's a difference between the general tone
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.380]   of your life being disaster,
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.100]   interspersed with a few moments of fun and joy,
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:02.360]   versus the general tone of your life being fun and joy,
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.360]   and good, interspersed with a few moments of disaster.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.860]   (silence)
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.900]   You can change those things
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.460]   faster than you can change almost anything else.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:22.100]   You really can.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.200]   So consider what you can do in your situation
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.140]   to improve your family.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:31.300]   It would be a real disaster for you to get old and rich
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.620]   'cause you saved money and worked all the time,
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.240]   and then not to know your children,
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.340]   not to know your wife.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.060]   Evaluate where you live.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.260]   One of the things that's so fascinating
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.800]   about this particular crisis is the difference
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.980]   in how people are experiencing it
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.420]   based upon their different lifestyles.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.860]   If you have gotten locked in and quarantined
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:52.940]   in a little tiny apartment in Wuhan, China,
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.740]   where they welded the doors of your apartment building shut,
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.860]   you had one experience.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.260]   If you got quarantined in a cute little villa
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.820]   out in the Italian countryside,
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.920]   you got another experience.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.320]   If you got quarantined in downtown New York City,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.100]   you've had a third experience.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.620]   If you got quarantined on your 160 acre farm
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.200]   in the rolling hills of Virginia,
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.380]   you've had a very different experience.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:21.020]   Consider what that would mean to you.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.900]   Again, just sharing from good things,
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.800]   for us, our quarantine has been great.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:29.460]   I was telling my wife just this morning
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.700]   how thankful I am not to be living in an RV right now
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.060]   'cause that would be really tough
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.380]   to be quarantined in an RV.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.920]   There are travelers all around the world
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.160]   stranded right now.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.360]   People can't get to their boats.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.420]   They can't get out of the,
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:42.640]   they're locked in RV campground.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.120]   They can't move, they can't drive.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:44.960]   It's tough.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.640]   And I think there's time for that.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.440]   We can't always predict when disasters occur,
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.040]   but in general, your lifestyle is gonna be set up
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.900]   and it can be made better or worse.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:57.720]   You know, we live in a great house.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.820]   I got a great yard.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.040]   And so for us, we've hardly noticed it
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.680]   because we're kind of homebodies anyway.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.340]   It's just the quarantine for us
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:08.980]   has been a slightly smaller social sphere
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.920]   than it otherwise was.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.780]   Now, is that better or worse?
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.340]   No, just saying that it's been much more comfortable
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.180]   than other places.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:18.460]   And so one of the things that would be a big deal for me
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:21.980]   is if I ever needed to move into the city,
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.560]   I need to live in a small apartment in the city,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.860]   given this experience,
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.980]   I would never want to be locked down in the city.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.520]   That's always been important to me.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.360]   If I lived in a city,
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.100]   I gotta have a way to get out of the city.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.260]   The city can be a place of tremendous resources.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.420]   You're unlikely to starve in the city
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.020]   because they're gonna send all kinds of food there.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.800]   The grocery stores are gonna be stocked in the city
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.340]   before they are in the country.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.180]   But then there can become a stressing point
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.860]   where the city is not such a wonderful place to be.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.980]   Clearly, the city is not such a healthy place to be
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.780]   in some circumstances.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:55.060]   And so, you know, that 160 acre farm in Virginia
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:59.380]   or that half acre lot somewhere with a nice RV on it,
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.140]   with a yard the kids can play on,
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.700]   it's all of a sudden looking a little bit better
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.100]   versus being stranded in your 37th floor apartment.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.220]   Consider if there's an option there.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.860]   I've been fascinating to watch how different states,
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:13.580]   both states within these United States
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.980]   and also states as in governments around the world
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:19.320]   have dealt with the lockdowns and the quarantines, et cetera.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.540]   Man, living in a police state is not fun.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.220]   It's shocking.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:28.460]   I would not have predicted some of the civil liberties
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.380]   that people would give up,
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:30.500]   especially in the United States,
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.260]   again, where I have the most experience.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:36.260]   I never believed that the Americans would sit down
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.940]   and let themselves be arrested for paddle boarding
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.500]   and why they would put up with that.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.060]   I thought better of the Americans.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.740]   But man, there's a big difference
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.780]   in how these things are done from state to state.
[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.220]   So pay attention.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.340]   And then just simply, you know,
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:53.740]   how do you assess the safety of the place that you live?
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:55.540]   You have a community that you like being a part of.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.620]   Just assess those things.
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.420]   And if there are any changes, think about making them.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:05.220]   In closing, times of difficulty are times of opportunity.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:15.020]   Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn.
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.620]   It's possible that you are not in a position
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.660]   to profit from this current event.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.060]   It's possible that this is going
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.180]   to devastate you financially.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:30.580]   There's no reason for us to be unrealistic in our thinking.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.660]   There are millions and millions of families
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.060]   in the United States of America
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.940]   who are heading into bankruptcy in the coming years
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.900]   because of this.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.540]   Businesses heading into bankruptcy.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.580]   People fighting right now
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.420]   to see if they can avoid that outcome.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.500]   There are hundreds of millions of people around the world
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.260]   wondering where their food is gonna come from next week.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.020]   (birds chirping)
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.220]   What we're living in right now
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.620]   is wreaking devastation across the globe.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.060]   It's hurting people.
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:08.180]   Is the economic hurt, the economic uncertainty
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.180]   better than the physical hurt and the risk of the virus?
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.580]   I don't know.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.340]   And it doesn't matter if I know or not.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.540]   I'm not in any position to do anything
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.100]   other than set my family aside.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.820]   And I think all of us just have to take care of our own affairs.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.700]   I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.900]   I don't know if it's better or worse.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.460]   I don't see why I have to make a judgment on that.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:31.580]   What I would say is that millions
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.380]   and hundreds of millions of people right now are hurting
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.620]   and scared.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.260]   And they're not gonna be sitting aside
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.020]   ready to invest in, you know,
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.820]   make a fortune or buy a boat.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:50.140]   If that's you, resolve to learn from the pain.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.300]   Resolve to say, I'm going to go through this pain
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.860]   and it's going to be bad,
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.020]   but I am going to learn how to never again
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.420]   be here in my life.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.740]   Once I get out of this,
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.140]   I am never again going to be here in my life.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.380]   And so if that's the way that you win
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.500]   from this current disaster, that's good.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:23.140]   Start there.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:28.980]   You'll have a chance to do things differently.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.540]   I was struck this morning.
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:38.340]   I watched a, I was looking at a news article
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.380]   and I was, it's from the Daily Mail.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.980]   And the headline, it says,
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.740]   "Stark photos show miles long row of cars
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.620]   waiting outside a Florida food bank
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.340]   as demand surges by 600%
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.340]   and more than half a million residents
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.620]   file for unemployment."
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.700]   And so there's pictures, drone pictures of the cars.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.860]   And what's fascinating to me
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.100]   is to see how fancy the cars out are.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.340]   Now this is a South Florida phenomenon
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:11.100]   where especially Miamians, like Miami people
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.660]   will live in a roach infested single wide trailer
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.540]   while driving a $100,000 car.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.180]   They will starve so that they can drive their car
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.820]   because it is the status symbol.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:25.140]   But it's hard to find a broken down cheap car in this.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.700]   And what I think about this,
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.060]   certainly there's a component of which you say,
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.300]   should you make a better decision?
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.980]   But there's not a shame in seeking help if you need help.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.420]   Right, that's why food banks exist,
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.140]   which is why those of us who have the means,
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.780]   we need to donate to those, to a food bank.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.140]   Whether it's a food bank organization,
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.340]   they need money, they need food.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:46.700]   And so let's support those to help people in need.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.660]   And if you need help, go and seek it out.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:54.660]   But there is clearly a crazy prioritization here
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.180]   where somebody is out of food
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.580]   or feels that they need food
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.700]   in potentially less than a month after a disaster.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.940]   That is, I don't wanna say text,
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.220]   the textbook definition of insanity, it's certainly not,
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.140]   but it's crazy.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.180]   It's crazy.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:16.540]   If you look at the cars in this line,
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.660]   not all of them, some of them are basic
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.900]   entry-level transportation, few thousand dollar cars.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.780]   But there are many 40, 50, $60,000 cars
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.740]   sitting in this line that I can clearly identify
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.620]   from the drone photos.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.380]   That's a big deal.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:33.700]   The fact that somebody with a new car,
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.300]   here's a Mercedes SUV,
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.140]   being loaded with donated food in the back of it.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:45.380]   That should be a shocking picture
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:50.380]   of a complete and total misunderstanding
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:53.020]   of the proper priorities of life.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:57.260]   Don't resolve that that is never you.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.540]   Resolve that that is never you going to a food bank
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.020]   after potentially a month of unemployment
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.260]   to pick up donated food driving
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.500]   in your expensive Mercedes SUV.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.340]   Resolve that that's not you.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.580]   Have some self-pride and some self-worth
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.540]   and some foresight to make sure that's not you.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.500]   So if all you gain from this is a chance to learn,
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.460]   okay, learn.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:25.860]   Learn as to how you can improve for next time.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.140]   Learn so that you're not here again.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.660]   But if you do have some resources
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.460]   and you've been waiting for this time,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:37.220]   get busy looking for opportunities.
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:40.300]   Get busy looking for that new job, that new career.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.300]   Get busy seeing, can I take a little bit of training
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.340]   and qualify myself for something new?
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.140]   Get busy focusing in on, hey, how are my competitors doing?
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:48.620]   Can I buy my competitors out?
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.500]   I coach a number of entrepreneurs.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.620]   The lesson right now is,
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.420]   have you touched base with your competitors?
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.860]   'Cause right now is the chance to be talking to them
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:01.180]   and saying, hey, listen, I'm ready to,
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.340]   do you want to sell?
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.420]   Let's get some discounts on buying some new businesses
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.180]   and expanding our operations.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.380]   On buying the equipment at the bankruptcy sale
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.260]   from the businesses going out of sale.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:15.500]   See, bankruptcy is incredibly important in a marketplace.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.540]   It's incredibly important
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.500]   because it provides an opportunity
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.220]   for old businesses to get washed out
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:31.700]   and for them to be replaced with newer businesses.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.460]   And that happens very effectively at a bankruptcy auction
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.540]   when a new business can come in and buy the equipment
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.220]   and such for businesses going out.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.700]   It gets rid of all the dead weight,
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:43.700]   all of the broken promises and such
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.180]   and provides new opportunities
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.020]   to the new competitors the chance to come in.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.020]   So look around and see,
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.180]   is there a way that I can profit from this?
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.820]   Be positioned to win.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:58.020]   And I think there'll be some opportunities for you.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.100]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.260]   Hope this has been helpful for you.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:05.140]   I hope, I want you to come away from this show
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.860]   with a sense of hope and a sense of optimism.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.700]   And I want you to look for the opportunities in your life.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:15.380]   I've tried over the years to focus on
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.580]   preparing for disaster,
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.540]   preparing for financial disaster,
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.060]   societal disaster, whatever disaster means.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:22.980]   Because if you're prepared,
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:24.700]   if you've at least thought through it,
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:29.700]   then you're positioned to win on the other side of it.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:34.020]   So hopefully you've done your preparations.
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.220]   If you haven't, learn the lessons.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.900]   But now that you've done those preparations,
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.900]   disaster is here.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.500]   And now it's time to start looking for opportunity.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.540]   There are many, many ways
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.060]   that you can profit from this opportunity.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.900]   So get busy looking for them.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.540]   Be creative.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.860]   Constraints force upon you creativity.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.580]   They provide you new opportunities.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.380]   Reorganize your business.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.580]   Tackle a new market.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:03.140]   Look creatively for anything that you can do
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.540]   to improve your circumstances and situation.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.100]   If you start looking for things,
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.260]   it's been my experience that you generally find them.
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.060]   Pretty much find what you go out looking for in the world.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.940]   Hope that's helpful for you.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.140]   Thank you for listening.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.220]   I would encourage you,
