[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   You're so worried about not offending someone
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.380]   or not hurting someone's feelings
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000]   that you fail to tell them something
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.740]   they'd be better off knowing in the long run.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.300]   And that is what I call ruinous empathy.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.220]   You wanna start out by making sure
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.540]   that you're soliciting feedback more than you're giving it.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.620]   If I criticize you publicly,
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.980]   you're likely to go into fight or flight mode
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.340]   and then you physically cannot hear what I'm saying.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.500]   We kind of have this bad instinct about disagreement.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.540]   We think that a disagreement is gonna pose a risk
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.700]   to our relationship.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.980]   - I imagine many people listening aren't familiar
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.540]   of your first book, "Radical Candor."
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.500]   So how would you introduce that concept to people?
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500]   - One of the things about "Radical Candor"
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.700]   is that sometimes people hear the term
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.780]   and they assume it is licensed to act like a jerk,
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.820]   which it is not.
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.380]   - How do you start to make change?
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.340]   And then maybe after that, how do you help others?
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.120]   - So the thing that I have done
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780]   that has helped me more than anything else is...
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.540]   - Kim, thanks for being here.
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.620]   I'm a big fan of your work
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.420]   and I'm excited to have you on the show.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.420]   - Thank you so much.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.580]   I'm really excited for our conversation.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.420]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.280]   So I imagine many people listening aren't familiar
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.220]   with the concept of your first book, "Radical Candor,"
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.880]   which I've heard you define as both caring personally
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.100]   and challenging directly at the same time.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.300]   And then I've also heard you say
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.280]   it's best understood for what it's not.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.120]   - Yes.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.020]   - So how would you introduce that concept to people?
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.980]   - All right, so one of the things about "Radical Candor"
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.140]   is that sometimes people hear the term
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.220]   and they assume it is licensed to act like a jerk,
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.080]   which it is not.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.540]   So if you think about caring and challenging
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.060]   at the same time,
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940]   those two things, caring and challenging,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.380]   they don't really seem so radical.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.660]   So why do I call it "Radical Candor?"
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660]   I think part of the reason is that
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.860]   everyone I've ever met struggles with feedback.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.760]   They struggle hearing it and they struggle giving it.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.900]   And so if you think about,
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.100]   I love a good two-by-two framework.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900]   So draw in your mind a vertical line,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.380]   and that is the care personally dimension of "Radical Candor."
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.860]   And a horizontal line,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.340]   that's the challenge directly dimension.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.020]   In the bottom right-hand box where you are challenging,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.540]   but you're not showing that you care,
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.320]   even if you do care, you're not showing that you care,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.540]   that is what I call obnoxious aggression.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480]   And in the first draft of the book,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.340]   I called that the "Asshole Quadrant,"
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.020]   'cause I don't know, it seemed more radically candid.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.500]   And I stopped doing that for a really important reason,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.140]   'cause I found that when I did that,
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.260]   people would start writing names in boxes
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.440]   in this two-by-two.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.340]   And I beg of you and all of your listeners,
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.180]   please don't do that.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.680]   This is not another Myers-Briggs personality test
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.140]   or something like that.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.820]   Use this kind of framework to guide specific conversations
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.260]   with specific people to a better place.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500]   So you don't wanna be obnoxiously aggressive
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.580]   because it hurts other people
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.180]   and also because it's inefficient.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.940]   Like if I'm a jerk to you, Chris,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.520]   then you go into fight or flight mode,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.700]   and then you literally physically cannot hear
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.820]   what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.220]   So I think there's also though,
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.580]   not only those two problems with obnoxious aggression,
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.420]   but there's a third more subtle problem,
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.060]   which is, at least for me,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.760]   so you can tell me, Chris, if this happens to you too.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.060]   But when I realized that I'd acted like a jerk,
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.980]   it's not actually my instinctive response
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.460]   to move up on the care personally dimension
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.420]   of radical candor.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.060]   Instead, it's my response
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.300]   to go the wrong way on challenge directly
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.260]   and say, oh, I'm sorry, it's no big deal.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.420]   I didn't really mean it, but it is a big deal,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.500]   and I did mean it, you know?
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.100]   So now I'm basically lying.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.340]   And so now I've landed in the worst place of all,
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.860]   manipulative insincerity.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.380]   This is where passive aggressive behavior,
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.800]   political behavior, all of the things
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.700]   that really erode trust
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060]   in any kind of relationship creep in.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.140]   - And that's the bottom--
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.020]   - The bottom left quadrant, you know,
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.620]   where you're neither caring nor challenging.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.020]   You haven't gone the right way on care personally,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.420]   you've gone the wrong way on challenge directly.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.180]   And if you think about what goes wrong in relationships,
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.700]   especially what goes wrong in relationships at work,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.180]   you're gonna talk a lot about obnoxious aggression
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.100]   and manipulative insincerity.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.700]   If anybody watches "The Office,"
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.540]   they're gonna see a lot of episodes
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.540]   about those two behaviors,
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.260]   'cause that's where the drama is
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.980]   and the ridiculousness is.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.140]   However, I don't think these are our most common mistakes
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.980]   in most relationships.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.220]   In my experience,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.700]   and I'd be curious to hear what you think, Chris,
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.740]   but in my experience,
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.780]   the vast majority of us
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.020]   make the vast majority of our mistakes
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.700]   in this last upper left-hand quadrant,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.620]   where you do remember to show that you care personally,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.460]   'cause you know what?
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.140]   Most people are actually pretty nice people
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.820]   when it comes right down to it.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.940]   So you do remember to show that you care personally,
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.820]   but you're so worried about not offending someone
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.700]   or not hurting someone's feelings
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.340]   that you fail to tell them something
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.060]   they'd be better off knowing in the long run.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.900]   And that is what I call ruinous empathy.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.460]   And if there's one big reason why I wrote "Radical Candor,"
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.260]   it's to help us all be less ruinously empathetic,
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.100]   'cause it's not a good thing.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.220]   It feels nice, but it's actually mean in the long run.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.260]   Yeah, I think my wife has consistently given me feedback
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.220]   on my managerial skills of like, "You're being too nice."
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.460]   And I feel like that's another way
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.460]   of saying ruinously empathetic.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.300]   Exactly, sort of another way to think about it
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.580]   is to think about what's the difference
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.460]   between nice and kind.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.420]   Nice usually isn't so nice in the long run,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.220]   but kind is what we're really shooting for.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.060]   And I want people to be kind, but kind is radically candid.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.180]   When I think of too nice, I think there's,
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.940]   I grew up in the South, and there's this anecdote
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.860]   about someone went to finishing school,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   and they were taught to say, "How nice," instead of, "F you."
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.540]   And that's really what's going on often
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.100]   when people are being too nice.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.540]   Not intentionally, but sort of unintentionally.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.540]   You hurt people with that kind of ruinous empathy.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.380]   Yeah, I think a lot of people have just been raised
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.140]   that like, you know, keep your mouth shut
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.380]   if you don't have anything nice to say,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.300]   and all of these things that,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.260]   I guess, leave us in that quadrant.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.620]   I mean, certainly my parents said that to me.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.820]   If you don't have anything nice to say,
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.860]   don't say anything at all.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.100]   And then all of a sudden, I was having this career
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.540]   where I was teaching people, oh, the problem,
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.580]   the thing that lands us in ruinous empathy
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.460]   is we have parents who say,
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.820]   "If you don't have anything nice to say,
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.300]   don't say anything at all."
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.260]   And then I myself had kids who would say
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.580]   these incredibly horrible things when they were two.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.220]   And I found myself saying that to my children too.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.900]   So compassion for my parents and all the parents
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.220]   who said that to their kids, but it doesn't help.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.980]   And we've talked a little bit about work and managing.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.940]   How important are these skills just in life,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.740]   or is this really just a workplace skillset?
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.380]   This is all relationships.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.220]   In fact, my publisher really wants me to write a book
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.780]   called "The House of Radical Candor,"
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.340]   where I talk about how important this is
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.260]   in your personal relationships.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.540]   In fact, one time I was giving a radical candor talk
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.900]   and somebody came up to me afterwards and they said,
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.380]   "Oh my gosh, if I had heard this five years ago,
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.300]   I wouldn't be divorced right now."
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.260]   And that's true.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.540]   I mean, in fact, I would say I wouldn't be married right now
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.660]   if it weren't for radical candor.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.380]   You want the story?
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.860]   So when I was dating this guy, who's now my husband,
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.980]   he had spent the night over at my house.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.420]   And the next morning,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.180]   I used to like to do yoga in the morning.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.980]   And so I went into another room to do yoga into,
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.380]   I had a one bedroom and a living room.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.060]   So it was like a two room situation.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.180]   So I went into, he was still asleep
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.940]   and I went into the living room to start doing yoga.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.660]   And as I was doing it, he came in and picked up the paper
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.820]   and started reading the paper.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.900]   And in the same room where I was trying to do my yoga.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.740]   And I was like,
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.140]   "Oh my gosh, this is why I can't be in a relationship."
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.060]   You know, and I was ready never to see him again.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.900]   And then I'm like,
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.980]   "Why don't I just ask him to leave the room?"
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.260]   And I said, "You know, I really can't do my yoga
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.660]   with you sitting there reading the paper."
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.700]   And he said, "Oh, I'm sorry."
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.740]   And he left the room and I was like,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.460]   "Oh, I could be in a relationship."
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.540]   So, and the rest is now there's two children
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.660]   and, you know, 16 years of marriage.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.740]   Wow. Okay.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.620]   And so that's one example,
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.260]   but if you think broadly about the kind of impact
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.020]   embracing radical candor could have on your life,
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.100]   your relationships, you know,
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.860]   is it more productive, you know, happier?
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.100]   How do you describe that impact?
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.060]   I would describe it as first,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.820]   I mean, what's most important to me
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.460]   is a deep relationship with people.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.500]   It's the relationships, I think,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.980]   that give both life and work meaning.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.340]   And so you have deeper relationships
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.900]   and there's plenty of evidence that shows
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.140]   when you have better relationships,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.220]   you're happier in life, but also you're more productive.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.700]   I have found in particular at work,
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.660]   when we have a couple of good relationships at work,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.660]   especially if that relationship is with our boss
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.380]   or our employee, like if it's in the context of a hierarchy,
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.940]   that is what unleashes our capacity
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.340]   to do the very best work of our lives.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.220]   Because it's the relationships at work
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.220]   that often give the work its meaning
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.180]   rather than the work itself.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.140]   I mean, for some people it's the work itself,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.500]   but often it's the relationships at work.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.740]   And I also think that when you have a bad relationship
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.380]   at work, especially if it's with your boss,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.900]   it has a huge impact.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.900]   I just read somebody posted on LinkedIn,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.060]   a statistic, you know, I haven't validated this,
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.780]   but if it's not true, it ought to be.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.660]   A statistic that showed that your relationship
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.460]   with your boss has a bigger impact on your health outcome
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.380]   than the quality of your doctor.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.980]   And I certainly have found when I've had bad bosses,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.860]   I don't, you know, I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.660]   or at one point I had a boss who was sort of belittling
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.020]   and I literally shrank half an inch.
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.300]   My doctor was like, what is going on?
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.020]   You know, I was only 30 and I'm only five feet tall.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   Like I didn't have half an inch to give.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.660]   And then I quit and I gained my half an inch back.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.540]   It can, a bad relationship with a manager
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.980]   can really have a physical impact on your life.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.340]   I worked with someone else who was working for a boss
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.700]   who was a bully and they broke out in hives.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.300]   You know, they got like a physical rash.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.460]   It's a big deal.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.660]   There's also a lot of research that shows
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.460]   a bad relationship with your boss makes you more prone
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.100]   to have a heart attack.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.340]   So it is, it really matters.
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.660]   It's not like something you just have to tough out.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.220]   Okay, so it matters.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.700]   I imagine for a lot of people it's uncomfortable.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.060]   We talked about how a lot of people
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.140]   are kind of people pleasers.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.700]   How do you figure out, you know, where you are?
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.180]   Is there some kind of diagnostic?
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.460]   How do you start to make change?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.020]   And then maybe after that, how do you help others?
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.140]   So I will say that you probably are in all of these boxes
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.580]   all of the time.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.260]   So again, when I said
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.940]   this is not another Myers-Briggs personality test,
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.620]   like try not to write your own name in a box either,
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.620]   but just try to be aware when you've drifted into the box.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.380]   So the thing that I have done
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.900]   that has helped me more than anything else
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.140]   is to think back over the course of my life
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.540]   about a time when I was, for example, ruinously empathetic.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.980]   'Cause that's, we'll start there
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.500]   'cause that's the most common mistake that we make.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.860]   And to give that story a name.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.820]   And then when I'm tempted in the future
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.260]   to be ruinously empathetic, to think about that story.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.420]   So let me, you want me to tell you a story?
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.700]   I'll lay it on you.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.180]   So this happened.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.860]   I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.420]   So this is my Bob story.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.460]   His name was not actually Bob.
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.420]   And I liked Bob a lot.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.260]   Bob was smart, funny, charming.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.500]   He would do stuff like we were in a manager offsite
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.820]   playing one of those endless get to know you games.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.060]   Ever played one of those?
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.540]   And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.140]   and to say, I can tell everybody is really stressed out
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.300]   and that everybody kind of wants to get back to work.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.740]   I've got an idea.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.420]   It will help us get to know each other
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.940]   and it'll be really fast.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.660]   Whatever his idea was, if it was really fast,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.060]   we were down with it.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.620]   So Bob says, let's just go around the table
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.620]   and confess what candy our parents used
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.060]   when potty training us.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.820]   Really weird, but really fast.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.700]   Weirder yet, everybody remembered,
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.300]   Hershey Kisses right here.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.020]   And then for the next 10 months,
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.700]   every time there was a tense moment in a meeting,
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.940]   Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.180]   for the right person at the right moment.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.020]   So Bob was a little quirky,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.220]   but brought some levity to the office.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.060]   Everybody loved working with Bob.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.420]   There was one big problem with Bob.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.100]   He was doing terrible work.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.980]   He would hand stuff into me
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.620]   and there was shame in his eyes.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.620]   And I was so puzzled,
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.540]   I couldn't understand what was going on
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.300]   because he had this incredible resume,
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.660]   this great history of accomplishments.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.740]   I learned much later,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.780]   the problem was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.620]   three times a day,
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.980]   which maybe explained all that candy
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.700]   that he had all the time.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.460]   But I didn't know any of that at the time.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.220]   All I knew was that he was handing in
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.380]   this terrible work to me.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.740]   And I would say something to him along the lines of,
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.340]   oh, Bob, this is a great start.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.780]   You're so awesome.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.140]   Everybody loves working with you.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.220]   Maybe you can make it just a little bit better.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.180]   Kind of the thing that we do
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.420]   when we're being too "nice".
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.500]   And it's worth kind of double-clicking on this too nice.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.180]   Like, why was I doing that?
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.340]   I think part of it was truly ruinous empathy.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.980]   I really did like Bob
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.820]   and I really did not want to hurt Bob's feelings.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.300]   But if I'm honest with myself,
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.980]   there was also something more insidious going on there
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.820]   because Bob was popular
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.060]   and Bob was also kind of sensitive.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.900]   And so there was part of me that was afraid
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.260]   if I told Bob in no uncertain terms
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.500]   that his work wasn't nearly good enough,
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.620]   that he would get upset.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.020]   He might even start to cry.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.700]   And then everybody would think I was a big, you know what?
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.140]   And so the part of me that was worried about my reputation
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.300]   as Bob's boss was the manipulative insincerity part.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.140]   That's why I was reluctant to give him honest feedback.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.180]   Open, radically candid feedback.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.140]   And then the part of me that was worried
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.660]   about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.140]   And this went on for 10 months
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.700]   and eventually the inevitable happened.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.300]   And I realized that if I don't fire Bob,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.500]   I'm gonna lose all the best performers on the team
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.820]   because not only have I been unfair
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.100]   and really unkind to Bob not to tell him,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.140]   I've been unfair to the whole team
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.260]   because not only is Bob not getting any better,
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.100]   but their deliverables, everybody's deliverables are late
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.060]   because Bob's deliverables are late.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.700]   Everybody on the team is not able to spend as much time
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.020]   as they need to on their work
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.140]   'cause they're having to redo Bob's work.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.300]   And the people who are best at the job are gonna quit
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   and go work somewhere where they can do their best work.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.740]   And so when I realized this,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.420]   I sat down to have a conversation with Bob
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.020]   that I should have started, frankly, 10 months previously.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.060]   And when I finished explaining to him where things stood,
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.580]   he pushed his chair back from the table
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.420]   and he looked me right in the eye and he said,
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.220]   "Why didn't you tell me?"
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.300]   And as that question was going around in my head
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.180]   with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said,
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.900]   "Why didn't anyone tell me?
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.940]   "I thought you all cared about me."
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.300]   And now I realized that by not telling Bob,
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.500]   thinking I was being so nice,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.700]   I'm having to fire him as a result of it,
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.820]   not so nice after all.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.820]   But it was too late to save Bob.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.860]   Even Bob at this point agreed he should go
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.540]   because his reputation on the team was just shot.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.300]   All I could do in the moment
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.860]   was make myself a very solemn promise
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.260]   that I would never make that mistake again.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.540]   And that I would do everything in my power
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.300]   to help other people making that mistake
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.260]   'cause we all do it.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.380]   We do it not only at work.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.780]   We do it, I mean, think about,
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.900]   there was one time a guy came up to me
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.220]   after I'd given a talk and he said,
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.740]   "Yeah, you know, I got married
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   "and my wife tended to clink her teeth with her spoon
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.900]   "when we were eating cereal in the morning
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.300]   "and it bugged me, but I didn't wanna be,
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.860]   "you know, I didn't wanna say anything."
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.580]   And like five years later,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.500]   she clinked her teeth with her spoon.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.580]   I'm like, "I need a divorce."
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.740]   I'm sure there was other stuff going on,
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.940]   but it happened, like we do this in all aspects of our life.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.220]   - It's so funny 'cause I have a similar one with my wife.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.660]   I'm like, "Use your lips to get this food off the spoon,
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.340]   "not your teeth, especially 'cause your teeth chip
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.180]   "all the time."
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.860]   - Yeah, but you told her at least.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.700]   - I did tell her.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.020]   Yeah, well, so it's funny 'cause I think sometimes
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.620]   I go down one path, maybe in my manager hat,
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.500]   I go down the ruinous empathy path
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.460]   and obnoxious aggression maybe feels a lot,
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.380]   but sometimes I'm in a point where I'm like,
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.220]   "When someone's doing great, like even at home,
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.700]   "like I love my wife, she's great."
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.540]   Like, I noticed three things.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.780]   I'm like, "Oh, I wanna tell you these three things,
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.180]   "but it just seems so like rude."
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.180]   And like, "You know I love you,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.860]   "so you know it's coming from a good place."
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.940]   But like, you know that whole kindness sandwich
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.780]   or something where it's like,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.180]   "Oh, if you wanna give, deliver bad information,
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.120]   "it's like something nice, something, you know,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.580]   "to improve, something nice again."
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.620]   What about when we're on that side of like,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.740]   we wanna give people this feedback,
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.540]   we wanna make sure they know we care,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.860]   even if we think they do, how do you deliver it?
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.420]   Yeah, yeah, so a couple of things.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.980]   I would say, you know, Radical Cantor's
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.180]   not about nitpicking.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.300]   A good friend of mine got married and her,
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.260]   I guess it was her, I don't know,
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.580]   her uncle or somebody stood up at the rehearsal dinner
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.620]   and she got married on this island
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.900]   with a very weak septic system.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.020]   And so there were signs over all the toilets,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.820]   "If it's yellow, let it mellow.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.780]   "If it's brown, flush it down."
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.540]   And her uncle stood up and he said,
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.820]   "These are words to stay married by."
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.660]   You know, like, "You only need to say something
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.140]   "if it really matters."
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.380]   And so if something's really bothering you a lot,
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.900]   even if it's a small thing, by all means say it.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.340]   But if it's a little thing and you can let it go,
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.340]   I think it's fine to let some stuff go.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.540]   So if it's yellow, let it mellow.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.660]   If it's brown, flush it down.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.220]   But let's imagine you've decided it's brown.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.580]   So you wanna say the thing.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.860]   I think that you wanna start out
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.180]   by making sure that you're soliciting feedback
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.460]   more than you're giving it.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.460]   You know, you don't wanna dish it out
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.500]   until you prove you can take it.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.540]   So, and you also wanna make sure
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.660]   that you understand the other person's perspective.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   I think sometimes, especially when we're in relationships
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.100]   that we've been in for decades,
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.180]   it's easy to think you already know
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.860]   everything this person thinks, but we never do.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.580]   Like, you can never be married long enough
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   to really know someone, what they think all the time.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.620]   So make sure there's an order of operations.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.140]   Make sure that you're soliciting feedback.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.380]   And then, you know, you mentioned the feedback sandwich.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.540]   Am I allowed to curse on your podcast?
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.340]   I mean, there's the warning for anyone listening
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.620]   that is in a car with their children.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.260]   Turn the radio down for a second.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.980]   Turn the volume down for a second.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.860]   Nobody likes a shit sandwich.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.500]   Like, if you say, "Oh, Kim, you know,
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.020]   "I love your bookshelf.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.300]   "I hate your book, but I like your orange hoodie."
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.620]   Like, that doesn't make me feel any better, you know?
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.820]   So you wanna make sure that you're focused
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.420]   on the good stuff, but in a way
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.820]   that is specific and sincere.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.060]   So you do wanna give more praise than criticism, for sure.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.660]   So the next step in the radical canter of operations
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.860]   after soliciting feedback is giving praise.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.500]   But if it's something you would say to your dog,
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.220]   it's not good praise, you know?
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.500]   "Oh, good job."
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.700]   You know, that doesn't really help anybody.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.700]   So you wanna make sure that you're sort of using this,
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.100]   you know, I hate acronyms.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.860]   I was just talking to Bob Sutton,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.300]   who wrote "The No Asshole Rule,"
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.380]   and he talks about jargon monoxide.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.300]   So if this sounds like jargon monoxide, I apologize.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.500]   But it's useful sometimes to have an acronym
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.540]   to remember in the moment.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.340]   So when I'm thinking about praise,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.060]   I try to think about core,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.620]   context, observation, result, next step.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.020]   I don't call it corn because I did a Google search on that,
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.980]   and it means something else to other people,
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.660]   so I call it core.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.700]   So context, like in the meeting, observation,
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.540]   when you argued both sides of the case,
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.060]   results, you earned credibility,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.500]   next step, do more of that.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.820]   So that's what I mean by core.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.740]   Don't just say good job,
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.580]   but make sure you're telling the person specifically
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.780]   what was good and what they could do more of.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.860]   Like the purpose of praise is to let them know
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.700]   what to do more of.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.940]   In fact, if you think about radical candor
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.660]   as helping someone else scratch an itch
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.940]   on an unreachable spot in your back,
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   you gotta say, yeah, that's good or no, that's not good.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.660]   And you need to be able to say both.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.460]   So praise is really important.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.860]   But let's say this is not praise.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.340]   This is a little criticism.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.900]   You wanna give someone who you love
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.540]   and who knows that you love them.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.380]   Hopefully you know them well enough
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.060]   to know how things land for them.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.420]   So you wanna go in and you wanna be,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.940]   make sure that you're humble,
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   that you're not sure you're right.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.580]   To me, I call it candor and not the truth.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.860]   'Cause if I go to you, Chris,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.540]   and I say, I'm gonna tell you the truth,
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.300]   I'm kind of implying like, I've got a pipeline to God
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.540]   and you don't know beep from Shinola.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.220]   And that's not a great way to, I beeped out.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.340]   So you don't have to turn the volume down.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.580]   So to me, candor implies,
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.500]   here's how I understand the situation.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.140]   I'm also really curious to know
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.660]   how you understand the situation.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.260]   And so you wanna be humble.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.020]   You wanna state your intention to be helpful.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.220]   I think sometimes when people get, receive criticism,
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.660]   they receive it as though you're trying to like be dominant
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.340]   or show you're smarter than they are.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.100]   And so you wanna make sure
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.380]   that you're getting on the same side of the table
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.300]   with the person.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.540]   I can tell you really care about this dish
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.220]   you're cooking for this dinner party.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.780]   And I have an idea that I think will make it even better,
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.980]   whatever it is, state your intention to be helpful.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.860]   You wanna do it right away.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.180]   You don't wanna hold on to stuff,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.060]   especially if it's critical feedback.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.660]   I think we've all had relationships
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.740]   where someone told us about something
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.980]   that we did six months ago that really upset them.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.660]   And you're like, you've been holding onto that
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.500]   this whole time?
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.940]   Like, why didn't you tell me six months ago?
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.340]   So you wanna tell them right away.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.380]   And if you're like so angry
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.820]   that you don't think you can say it right, you can delay.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.780]   But usually when I say in my mind,
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.700]   oh, I'm gonna wait for the right moment.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.140]   What I'm really telling myself
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.840]   is I'm never gonna say that thing.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.020]   So you wanna say it right away in general.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.020]   You also want to make sure that if possible,
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.540]   you're having this conversation in person.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.740]   If not possible,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.900]   you wanna have a conversation on the phone.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.220]   Do not send an email, do not send a text.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   Slack is a radical candor train wreck waiting to happen.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.580]   You don't wanna criticize people
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.780]   in front of other people and in writing.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.540]   And the reason why I say have a phone call
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.100]   or an in-person conversation
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.980]   is because a big part of success is gauging how it's landing.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.460]   And if you broadcast it with a text message,
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.620]   you have no idea how your words are landing
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.740]   for the other person.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:53.420]   And if it's praise, of course do it in public,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.040]   but you gotta criticize in private.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.860]   If I criticize you publicly,
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.220]   you're likely to go into fight or flight mode
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.580]   and then you physically cannot hear what I'm saying.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.060]   So once again, I'm wasting my breath.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.940]   And so don't do that.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.620]   And also use core with criticism,
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.940]   context, observation, result, next step.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.420]   So I had a boss who told me in the meeting,
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.660]   that's the context.
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.860]   When you said, "Um," every third word,
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.500]   that's the observation.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.580]   The result, it made you sound stupid.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.100]   Go visit this speech coach.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.820]   So that's core criticism, you know.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.340]   But there's a world of difference
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.100]   between saying in the meeting,
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.500]   when you said, "Um," every third word,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.820]   it made you sound stupid,
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.940]   here's a speech coach you can visit.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.060]   There's a world of difference between saying that
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.780]   and saying, "Oh Kim, you're just too stupid to do this job."
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.540]   Like that would be awful.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.860]   And a lot of people object to the use of the word stupid,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.740]   which is some criticism I've gotten about that story.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.020]   And so maybe it's better to say, you know,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.180]   something else, say, you know, you lost credibility.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.900]   But in my case,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.220]   that was the word that really got my attention.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.980]   And my boss knew me well enough to know
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.380]   that that was the okay word to use with me,
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.660]   that it wasn't gonna crush me,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.500]   but it was gonna get my attention.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.420]   - Yeah.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.660]   Okay, so I'm gonna back up a little because you said
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.940]   you wanna start by soliciting feedback.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.500]   Are there easy ways to do that?
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.700]   I feel like sometimes,
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.420]   even when I'm recording an episode at the end,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.500]   I'm like, "Oh, do you have any feedback?"
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.020]   And people are like, "Nope, that was great."
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.340]   - Yeah.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.220]   - What tips do you have
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.860]   when people are not easily able to give good feedback?
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.140]   - Yeah, which nobody is easily.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.100]   I mean, except your teenage children.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.340]   If you have a teenager, they're really good at this.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.060]   This is a service they offer with alacrity.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.340]   But other people are very reluctant to give you feedback.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.300]   So I have found if I say, "Do you have any feedback for me?"
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.500]   The answer is invariably, "Oh no, everything's fine."
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.340]   So I have four bits of advice for soliciting feedback.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   The first is you wanna ask the question
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.780]   in a way that sounds like you.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.140]   So I'm gonna tell you the question that I like to ask,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.220]   but do not write it down.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.140]   'Cause if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself,
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.580]   the other person's not gonna believe you want the answer.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.220]   So the question I like to ask is,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.220]   "What could I do or stop doing
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.580]   that would make it easier to get along with me?"
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.940]   And that's a question.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.580]   I mean, I've been married since 2007, so for a while,
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.140]   but I still occasionally ask my husband some version,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.220]   what could I do?
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.540]   What could I have done or not done in that situation
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.740]   so that you wouldn't be so mad right now?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.380]   'Cause my goal is obviously not to make you mad.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.580]   And so, but don't write down that question
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.620]   because if those are not the words you would use,
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.740]   the other person is gonna be like,
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.820]   "Did you just listen to some podcast?"
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.940]   And so, in fact, I was working with Krista Quarles
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.060]   when she was the CEO of OpenTable.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.820]   And she said, "Kim, I could never imagine
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.580]   your words coming out of my mouth."
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.500]   She said, "The question I like to ask is,
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.980]   tell me why I'm wrong."
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.660]   Okay, that's fine too, that's what worked for her.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.020]   But there were a couple of people in Krista's life
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.500]   that that question didn't work for
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.660]   because it seemed too aggressive to them
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.020]   and it kind of shut them down.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.820]   So she had to adjust.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.380]   Being authentic doesn't mean ignoring the impact
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.260]   you're having on other people.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.380]   And you can say the same thing to one person
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.100]   and it's gonna be awesome with that person.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.060]   The exact same thing to somebody else
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.540]   and they're gonna feel,
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.380]   they're either not gonna hear what you said
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.340]   because you weren't out far enough
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.540]   on the challenge directly dimension
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.140]   or they'll be crushed by it
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.620]   'cause you said it in a way that you meant as funny,
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.500]   but they didn't find funny at all.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.220]   So you gotta adjust for the other person.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.660]   So that's number one,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.140]   is think about your question very consciously.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.580]   Have a go-to question that you usually ask
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.700]   and then adjust it for whom you're asking it up.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.940]   And the other thing about the question
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.340]   is that it shouldn't be able to be answered
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.140]   with a yes or a no.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.980]   So what could I do or stop doing
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.660]   that would make it easier to work with me?
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.940]   Not, is there anything that I could do?
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.260]   And in fact, if you read the book,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.660]   you'll notice I wrote, "Is there anything?"
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.260]   And a reader gave me some feedback.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.300]   Great thing about radical writing about feedback
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.380]   is you're gonna get a lot of it
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.700]   and said, "It's better to ask what?"
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.620]   And I realized that is a good point.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.380]   So there you go.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.260]   So think about how you're gonna ask.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.300]   Now, no matter how good your question is,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.540]   the other person doesn't wanna answer it.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.900]   They're still gonna feel uncomfortable.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.100]   And the only way out is through.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.780]   You've just got to embrace the discomfort.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.820]   That's the second step, embrace the discomfort.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.180]   Really simple technique here.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.660]   Close your mouth and count to six.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.220]   (silence)
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:07.740]   We made it to six.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.420]   You're the first person who didn't jump in
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.060]   and say something.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.140]   - It's so hard.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.140]   - It is really hard.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.300]   Six seconds is a really long time.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.500]   So if you can manage to stay silent for six seconds
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.860]   and the other person is like smiling at you
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.460]   and then they're kind of wincing at you,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.260]   like just stay silent.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.780]   They'll probably say something.
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.940]   So now you've dragged this poor soul
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.060]   out on a conversational limb
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.140]   they never wanted to go on, right?
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.420]   It's crucial that you take the third step,
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.740]   which is to listen with the intent to understand,
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.820]   not to respond.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.860]   Because even though you just solicited feedback,
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.140]   you're probably gonna feel a little bit defensive
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.340]   when you get some.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.540]   And that doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.980]   or that you're shut down to feedback.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.940]   It just means you're human and that's all part of this.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.540]   And so you wanna think about maybe,
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.380]   here's a tactic for this third step,
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.100]   which is asking a follow-up question.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   So for example, my daughter said to me at breakfast one time
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.220]   "Mom, I wish you weren't the radical candor lady."
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.140]   And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.220]   And I thought, oh, I'm spending too much time at work.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.100]   She wants more time with me.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.780]   And then I thought, well, I should ask a follow-up.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.460]   I should take my own advice here.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.140]   Ask a follow-up question.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.220]   So I said, "Well, who do you wish I were?"
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.100]   And she said, "I wish you were the lady
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.180]   who minded her own business."
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.660]   So I was very, I could spend a little more time at work
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.380]   as far as she was concerned.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.780]   So you wanna make sure that you're really open
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.140]   to whatever it is the person is saying
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.980]   and that you have some kind of technique
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.620]   for managing your own defensiveness when you get it.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.980]   Now the fourth step.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.620]   So first was have a go-to question.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.700]   Second was embrace the discomfort.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.860]   Third was listen with the intent to understand,
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.700]   not to respond.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.580]   The fourth thing you need to keep in mind
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.860]   is that you've got to reward the candor.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.260]   Because when someone gives you critical feedback,
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.060]   they take a big risk, no matter who they are in your life.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.020]   And if you're gonna make a risky investment,
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.940]   you expect a big return.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.100]   And you can think about critical feedback
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.780]   as a very risky investment from that other person.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.900]   And if you do not reward them richly,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.260]   they are never gonna give you feedback again.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:37.140]   So you gotta make sure that you are,
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.500]   if you agree with the feedback,
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.140]   that you don't just say thank you,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.060]   but that you take the next step and fix the problem.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.100]   And then tell them that you fixed the problem,
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.380]   that they brought to your attention.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.020]   What do you do though, if you disagree with the feedback?
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.540]   This is tricky, 'cause you just solicited feedback,
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.660]   they told you, and you actually think,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.100]   you're not defensive, but you actually think they're wrong.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.940]   So in that situation, what I recommend doing
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.060]   is taking a look at what they said and what you think
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   and finding that five or 10%,
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.580]   there's some little bit of overlap between what they said
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.260]   and what you think that you can agree with.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.260]   And give voice to that, just to demonstrate
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.820]   that you're not instinctively shut down the feedback
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.340]   and to make your listening tangible.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.100]   And then what you wanna do next is you wanna say,
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.740]   so I agree with that, as for the rest,
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.020]   I wanna think about it and get back to you.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.980]   And then you must get back to them.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.660]   And you gotta offer them a respectful explanation
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.420]   of why you disagree.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.380]   I think that we kind of have this bad instinct
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.660]   about disagreement.
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.700]   We think that a disagreement is gonna pose a risk
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.660]   to our relationship.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.300]   But actually many of my best relationships,
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.420]   both in my personal life and at work,
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.820]   started with a really respectful disagreement.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.820]   And I have found that what really hurts a relationship
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.180]   is unspoken disagreement.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.060]   'Cause that's where resentment builds up,
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.140]   it builds up and then it explodes like a dirty bomb
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.380]   all over your relationship.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.220]   So talk to them and explain why you disagree
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.620]   and be willing, let them try to persuade you
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.940]   that you're wrong.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.500]   And you can't argue endlessly.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.420]   At some point you gotta listen, challenge, commit.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.820]   But don't skip the listen and challenge part
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.340]   before you get to some sort of commitment.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.500]   I like finding the overlap.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.940]   'Cause I can imagine a conversation between a couple
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.100]   where someone's like, "You never listened to me."
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.420]   And it's like, "Well, I do."
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.860]   But it's probably better to say, "Well, you know what?
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.540]   "I was distracted this afternoon.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.300]   "I'm gonna acknowledge that there was some overlap
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.060]   "in what you think and how I feel,
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.780]   "but I do listen to you sometimes."
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.340]   And you can kind of continue down that path, so.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.100]   Yeah, anytime somebody says never,
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.060]   there's some questions.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.180]   Those absolute rules are,
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.620]   and I say this to my kids all the time.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.900]   And what about the other side of that?
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.140]   What about when, let's say I'm delivering feedback
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.980]   and it's very clear to me
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   that the other person completely disagrees?
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.980]   Yeah, I think there's that Jerry Maguire movie
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.180]   and there's that scene where he's yelling,
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.500]   "You think we're arguing,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.020]   "and I think we're finally talking."
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.540]   And so I think one of the things
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.740]   that I have found disarming is to say,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.740]   "I can tell you totally disagree with me.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.540]   "Like, tell me why."
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.820]   And let them disagree with you
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.340]   and try to understand why they disagree with you.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.780]   And if the person is,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.220]   sometimes it happens that the person is disagreeing with you
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.500]   in a way that's obnoxious,
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.420]   like they're yelling at you or something.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.300]   And that is your cue to move up
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.860]   on the care personally dimension.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.380]   But it's kind of hard to care personally
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.620]   about someone who's yelling at you.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.940]   And so it's really useful in that moment
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.300]   to try to get curious, not furious.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.460]   Like, try to really understand
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.100]   why the person thinks what they think.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.460]   Not necessarily because you're gonna agree with it,
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.900]   but because it's interesting to understand why.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.460]   Okay.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.060]   And I'm starting to think about various people I know
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.180]   and conversations I've had.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.060]   And I have a bunch of friends in Israel
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.860]   who seem to be very direct and that's comfortable.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.820]   And we've spent some time in Japan and it's very different.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.340]   How do you start to think about using this language
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.420]   and skillset with people where maybe culturally
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.580]   they're not ready for it,
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.300]   or maybe culturally they're so ready for it,
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.580]   it's kind of uncomfortable for you?
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.900]   Yeah, at one point I was managing teams all over the world.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.820]   And believe me, radical candor in Israel
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.380]   or in the Netherlands sounds very different
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.740]   from radical candor in Japan.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.220]   In fact, with the team in Japan,
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.900]   I called it polite persistence
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.580]   because polite was how they liked to show
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.220]   that they cared personally.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.140]   And persistence was an easier way
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.420]   for them to think of challenge directly.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.340]   And once I had reframed it for them in that way,
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.460]   then believe me,
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.300]   they were relentlessly politely persistent.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.380]   And I heard a lot from them and learned a lot.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.460]   And we improved the product
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.980]   as a result of their polite persistence.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.660]   But if I had gone to the Netherlands or to Israel
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.180]   and said, be politely persistent,
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.420]   they would have interpreted that as me saying,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.340]   sort of be manipulatively insincere.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.580]   And because challenging directly
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.060]   was very much part of those cultures
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.540]   and really a sign of respect in those cultures.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.580]   And so I think it is useful to remember
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.980]   that radical candor gets measured,
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:02.140]   And that means that even though if you abstract up enough,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.780]   radical candor is about love and truth at the same time.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.700]   And those are pretty universal human values.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.860]   Not everybody, but most of us honor love and truth.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   But the way that we express love and truth
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.300]   is culturally relative.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.220]   And so you've got to adjust for the culture
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.140]   where you're operating,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.180]   but you also have to adjust for the individual
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   to whom you're speaking.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.420]   Like if you're being radically candid with me,
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.140]   I'm kind of stubborn and I'm not always the best listener.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.220]   So you're probably gonna have to attend more
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.180]   to the challenge directly dimension of radical candor,
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.420]   'cause I might just brush you off.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.260]   And you may have to say it again more clearly.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.340]   I'm aware of this feedback and I'm working on it,
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.260]   but that's just, but if you're managing my brother,
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.940]   who is a great listener
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.100]   and probably more sensitive than I am,
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.100]   you're gonna need to attend more
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.740]   to the care personally dimension.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.580]   You don't need to go as far out
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.300]   on the challenge directly dimension.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.580]   So sort of being aware of which vector to choose
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.900]   as you move forward in these conversations
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.300]   with different people and in different cultures.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.620]   And similarly on the note of different cultures,
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.060]   I have an assistant who lives in Sri Lanka
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.620]   and we overlap for a few hours a day.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.620]   But one of my challenges right now,
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.460]   yeah, I've gotten two pieces of feedback from you.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.020]   One, address things quickly.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.060]   And two, don't do them asynchronously,
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.300]   do them synchronously.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.100]   And I'm like, well, what about when someone's sleeping
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.580]   and I wanna get them feedback before they work,
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.060]   but I'm gonna be asleep.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.700]   Or just generally in a lot of work scenarios now
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.860]   where we're distributed,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.460]   people work different times, different days.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.780]   Are there any ways to be more radically candor
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.860]   when you're writing a private Slack message or an email?
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.820]   Or surely the answer can't always be
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.340]   to get on the phone or an email to give,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.860]   or sorry, a video to give feedback.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   Yeah, so I recommend finding time to get on the phone.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.580]   And the reason, it always feels more efficient
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.220]   to just fire off the message.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.220]   And it also feels easier
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.420]   'cause then you don't have to gauge how it landed
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.460]   because you don't have to know, you just fire it off.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.740]   If you think about the number of times though,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.820]   when you sent someone an email or a text
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.820]   and they totally misinterpreted what you were trying to say,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.460]   or they got incredibly offended because you used a word.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.180]   If you were having a synchronous conversation with them,
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.260]   you could have fixed it in the moment.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.100]   But once they read that
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.900]   and they're pissed off for 12 hours
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.380]   before they talk to you, like now it's exploded
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.300]   and it takes way more time actually to undo the damage.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.860]   We've all seen this happen with email and text and Slack.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.900]   And so I really think that it's worth,
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.660]   if you notice something in a meeting
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.780]   and you know that you only overlap
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.180]   for a couple of another hour,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.620]   I would say, send the person a text and say,
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.740]   "Can we have a two minute conversation?"
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.500]   Most radical candor conversations literally are two minutes.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   And so it's fast.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   And if you can gauge how what you're saying is landing,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.980]   like nine times out of 10,
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.820]   the person will just say,
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.060]   "Oh, thank you for pointing it out."
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.300]   And you'll be like, "I probably could have sent an email."
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.860]   But for that one time out of 10,
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.540]   where you really have offended someone
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.940]   and done a lot of damage to a relationship,
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.900]   it's gonna take a lot.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.940]   You can fix it usually in the two minutes
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.220]   if you're actually speaking to them synchronously.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.900]   And there's a lot of evidence that shows
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.940]   that there may be more noise than signal
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.700]   in facial expressions and body language over video.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.860]   And so I recommend the phone,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.260]   not another Zoom call, actually.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.500]   Just get on the phone.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.340]   'Cause then you're listening to the words
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.940]   the person is saying,
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.580]   and you're not misinterpreting their facial expression
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.340]   or body language.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.340]   So like, for example, if I get really angry,
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.020]   I'm more likely to tear up than to yell.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.380]   But you may think I'm sad, but I am not sad.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.940]   I'm really mad, you know?
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.580]   And if we're just talking on the phone,
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.540]   like that whole round trip doesn't even have to happen
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   'cause you don't have to notice facial expression
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.900]   or body language.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.220]   And even if you're gonna have the conversation in person,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.660]   I recommend taking a walk together
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.620]   instead of sitting across from the other person,
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.620]   you know, at a table or something.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.220]   There's something psychologically
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.780]   about walking in the same direction that's very useful.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.700]   There's also a lot of evidence that shows we think better
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.740]   when we're moving our bodies instead of just sitting there.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.100]   And you're not staring at the other person,
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.620]   misinterpreting their facial expressions and body language.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   And also sometimes looking, this is very mammalian,
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.020]   but when a mammal stares another in the eye,
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.100]   that can like be a sign to attack.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.660]   And so walking in the same direction
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.100]   can sometimes be a little more effective.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.260]   Yeah, for me, it's like,
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.620]   if I'm just sitting at my desk on the phone,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.020]   I feel like I have to be doing something.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.100]   I can't just be on the phone, it's very hard.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.340]   But if I'm just walking,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.820]   now it like checks the box in my mind of,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.140]   now I'm doing a thing and talking and it's clear,
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.980]   but it's nowhere near as distracting as, you know,
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.940]   reading emails or anything like that.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.380]   Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.140]   As soon as you're doing something,
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.340]   if you're sitting at your desk,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.460]   like there's some notification,
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.740]   no matter how good you are
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.860]   about turning all your notifications off,
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.980]   some notification is gonna come along and distract you.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.580]   And what do you think about just calling out
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.940]   the radical or the kind of care personally side of,
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.540]   hey, I noticed the work you've been doing lately
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.140]   hasn't been up to par.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.780]   I'm telling you this because I believe in you
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.020]   at this company and I think that I've seen work
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.420]   that shows that you can do it
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.940]   and just like calling it out in the feedback.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.700]   100%, 100%.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.660]   I think that that's part of like stating your intention
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.900]   to be helpful.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.020]   You know, humble and helpful
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.140]   are the most important parts of this.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.820]   And saying, you know,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.460]   I can tell you really care about this project
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.820]   and that's why I wanna tell you this thing
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.700]   is hugely important.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.780]   And telling the person you believe in them
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.700]   is like, that never goes awry.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.980]   I mean, unless you're lying and you don't believe in it,
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.820]   but that's a whole other topic.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.940]   - Yeah, yeah, of course, you have to believe it.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.500]   - Yes.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.700]   - Okay, so you mentioned earlier
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.740]   that one of the fun parts of writing a book
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.580]   about radical candor is that you get a lot of feedback.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.460]   - Yes.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.340]   - You know, I first came across your work
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.700]   five, six years ago when I was working at a company
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.860]   that managing a team, what's changed, right?
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.980]   I think the world's changed a bit.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.380]   What kind of feedback have you gotten?
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.740]   Where do you take some of these lessons from now?
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.980]   - Yeah, so hands down,
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.180]   the best feedback I got about radical candor
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.660]   happened shortly after the book came out.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.820]   I was at a tech company in San Francisco
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.380]   giving a radical candor talk
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.940]   and the CEO of that company had been a colleague of mine
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.020]   for the better part of a decade.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.100]   And she's a person who I like and respect enormously.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.660]   And she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.900]   And when I finished giving the presentation,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.540]   she pulled me aside and she said,
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.060]   "Kim, I'm really excited to roll out radical candor.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.180]   I think it's gonna help me build
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.260]   the kind of culture that I want.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.100]   But I gotta tell you,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.380]   it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you."
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.300]   And she went on to explain to me
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.220]   that as soon as she would give anyone
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.340]   even the most gentle, compassionate criticism,
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.300]   she would get slimed with the angry black woman stereotype.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.220]   And I knew this was true.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.940]   And as soon as she said it to me,
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.620]   I realized kind of four things at the same time.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.060]   The first was that I had not been a kind of colleague
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.340]   that I imagined myself to be.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.100]   I had failed even to notice the extent
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.900]   to which she had to show up unfailingly cheerful
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.180]   and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together,
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.300]   even though she had what to be pissed off about
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.020]   as we all do at work in six and a half years.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.580]   But she was not as free as I was to say.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.820]   And I was not as free as my husband
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.940]   was to say when I was, you know.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.820]   So I'd failed to notice,
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.020]   I'd failed to be an upstander really to her.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.460]   The second thing that I realized
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.300]   was that not only had I been in denial
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.780]   about what was happening to her,
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.660]   I had been even deeper in denial
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.980]   about the things that had happened to me
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.780]   as a woman in tech.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.100]   And kind of hard for the author of a book
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.300]   called "Radical Canner" to admit that I had been in denial.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.900]   But I had pretended throughout most of my career
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.020]   that a whole host of things were not happening
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.860]   that were in fact happening.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.420]   And I think the reason I had been in denial
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.740]   is that I hated to think of myself
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.020]   or of my colleague as a victim
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.060]   because we have such a strange attitude
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.100]   towards that in our society.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.660]   But even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.060]   did I wanna think of myself as a culprit.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.580]   So the third thing that I wrote,
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.700]   this was a big moment for me.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.580]   The third thing that I realized
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.980]   was that I had been even deeper in denial
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.860]   about the times in my career and in my life
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.740]   when I had been biased or said something
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.820]   or done something that was prejudiced or bullied someone.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.980]   And we all play those roles.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.980]   Sometimes we're the person who observed the thing.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:44.060]   Sometimes we're the silent bystander
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.300]   when we wanna be the upstander.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.180]   Sometimes we're the person to whom it happened.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.180]   And other times we're the person who did the thing
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.540]   even though we didn't, I never intended.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.260]   I never woke up and I don't think anybody really does
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.660]   or many people really do wake up and say,
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.700]   ah, I wanna be biased today.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.140]   I wanna be prejudiced today.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.620]   I wanna bully someone today.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:08.420]   Like that's not usually what causes those things to happen.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.020]   And then the fourth thing I realized was that as a leader
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.140]   I imagined I had created these workplaces
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:18.340]   that were sort of like these BS free zones.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:21.220]   But because I was refusing to notice bias, prejudice
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.580]   and bullying that was happening on my teams
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.980]   I hadn't built the kind of culture that I wanted to build.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.300]   So all of those realizations prompted me
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.900]   to write my next book, "Radical Respect."
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:36.660]   And there's been a lot written about this stuff.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.660]   Actually a lot more written about it
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.180]   since I started writing that book
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.020]   than when I began writing that book.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:48.060]   But we haven't solved these problems by a long stretch.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:52.180]   So hopefully "Radical Respect" will help people
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.780]   make things a little better.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.300]   - And I know it's not out yet
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.700]   so people can definitely pre-order
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.300]   but what are some of the things we can start to do
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.180]   for people who are like, okay, give me a little bit.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.020]   - So I think one of the things that is really helpful
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.700]   is to distinguish between bias, prejudice and bullying
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.260]   because there are three very different things
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.300]   but I think we tend to conflate them.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.820]   So I'm gonna leave you with super simple definitions.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.580]   Bias is just not meaning it.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:22.260]   So that's my definition, not meaning it.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.420]   And it's usually unconscious.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.460]   When we stop and think about the implications
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.700]   of what we just said or did,
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.660]   like that's not what we really consciously believe
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.020]   but often we're not aware of what's going on
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.140]   in our own brains.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.900]   Kahneman's book, "Thinking Fast and Slow"
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.100]   is really good on this.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.780]   So that's bias.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.980]   Prejudice on the other hand is very different.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.740]   It's meaning it.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.900]   So not meaning it, meaning it.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.340]   And prejudice is usually a very consciously held belief
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.340]   usually reflecting an unfair stereotype.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.100]   And bullying on the other hand,
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.340]   there's no belief conscious or unconscious really going on.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.980]   Person's just trying to be mean.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.140]   So not meaning it, meaning it, being mean.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.900]   So what do you do if it's bias?
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.660]   And I think this is really important
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.580]   because the right response to bias
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.780]   is just to hold up a mirror,
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.740]   to point it out to the other person
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.260]   and to do it in a way that is supportive of the other.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.740]   You're not trying to punish someone
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.300]   for something they're unconscious of.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.140]   You're just trying to make them aware.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.780]   So one of the things that I recommend
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:30.180]   is with the people who you're close with
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.580]   either in your personal life or at work,
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.140]   I come up with some kind of shared vocabulary.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.300]   So with the people who I work most closely with,
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.620]   we all have these little purple flags
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.180]   and we'll wave a purple flag if we're on Zoom
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:46.380]   or we'll say purple flag if we're on the phone.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.260]   And that gives the other person the opportunity
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.380]   to either say, "Oh, thank you.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.220]   I get it.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.780]   You know, I'm working on not saying that thing."
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.940]   Or to say, "Thank you for pointing it out,
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.660]   but I don't get it," you know?
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.060]   And learning how to say that,
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.340]   "Thank you for pointing it out.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.860]   I don't get it," is really hard
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.740]   because, you know, I don't know about you,
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.060]   but when someone points out to me
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.580]   that I've said or done something biased,
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.060]   I feel deeply and profoundly ashamed.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.340]   Like I can tell you-
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.660]   Can you give an example for people
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.660]   who are maybe not able to kind of really
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.060]   get what you're, some examples?
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.780]   Yeah, I mean, for example,
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   I was working with a team
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:34.140]   or kind of around helping folks roll these ideas out.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:37.380]   And I said in a meeting,
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.860]   "I am a slave to my calendar."
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.700]   And someone said,
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.020]   "Oh, do we really need a slavery metaphor there?"
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.340]   You know, and no, we did not need a slavery metaphor there.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.300]   And one of the people on the team is black
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.620]   and it especially was, you know, offensive to her.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.100]   And the last thing I wanted to, you know,
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.740]   it's easy enough for me to change the word.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.580]   So she waved a purple flag and I was like,
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.580]   "Oh, thank you."
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.500]   Like, I got it immediately in that case.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.260]   There was another time when I was working
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.340]   with a team of people and I said to someone,
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.140]   "Can we have lunch after this?"
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.260]   And someone waved a purple flag and I felt like,
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.300]   "What, what, what, what was wrong with that?"
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.100]   And they said, "I'll tell you after the meeting."
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.380]   Like we went on and then they reminded me it was Ramadan
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.300]   and this person was fasting.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.500]   And so those are the kinds of things where we,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.780]   you know, we say it wasn't like the worst thing
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.300]   in the world, but I would rather know than not know.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.300]   And that's why I find like disrupting the bias
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.500]   or whatever, the slightly offensive thing
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.340]   or maybe even extremely offensive thing you just said
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.060]   is so useful to deepen relationships.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.860]   I think, you know, one of the problems
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.980]   that a lot of teams have told me that they had
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.260]   with like unconscious bias training
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.980]   is that it felt a little bit like boiling the ocean.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:09.340]   There are so many different examples of unconscious bias
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.420]   that may or may not be relevant
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.100]   to a group of people working together.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.660]   If we can just work on the ones
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.660]   that the people in the room are experiencing,
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.340]   like that's great, that's a great next step.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:24.420]   Which is why I think disrupting the specific biases
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.900]   is really useful.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:30.860]   Like for example, I was working with a CEO
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.700]   who tended to stand up in front of his whole team
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.540]   and say, all right guys.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.740]   And you know, some of the women on the team didn't mind that,
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.660]   but others did.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.060]   And he's like, why don't I say, all right team
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.380]   or all right, you know, folks or something.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.700]   All right, y'all, I'm from the South.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.980]   So y'all comes trippingly off my tongue,
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.900]   doesn't come trippingly off everyone's tongue.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.940]   But like, it's easy enough to change the words
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.580]   that we use to work better with other people.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.660]   So why not be aware of them
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.740]   and help each other to be aware of them?
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I have a couple of things come to mind,
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.020]   but one is, you know,
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.460]   especially when I was working at a startup,
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.820]   there's just, it feels like right now,
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.060]   I'm thinking, okay, well, do we need flags?
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.860]   Like how do we run the meeting?
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.100]   What kinds of things do I need to make sure I do?
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.340]   At some point, is there,
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.660]   does this get in the way of actually doing the work?
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.300]   Or is it really a way to make doing the work more efficient?
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.580]   You know, as part of understanding.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.900]   - I think it's way more efficient
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.660]   to get the elephant out of the room
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.740]   than to leave the elephant in the room.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.820]   And usually if someone is saying
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.340]   or doing something that is biased,
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.340]   it is getting in the way of a team's ability
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.540]   to work well together.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.980]   I'll give you an example.
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.660]   I had this guy who I had just hired him.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.700]   This is when I was working at Google.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:02.380]   And he referred to the women on his team as girls.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.700]   And I knew that they found it offensive.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.180]   It bugs me when people refer to as, you know,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.700]   men as men and women as girls,
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.300]   but I didn't say anything to him.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.860]   I was his boss and it was my job to say something to him,
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.140]   but I didn't because it seems I was busy.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:19.980]   We were stressed.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.620]   It was a new relationship.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:25.220]   And then he went to meet with my boss,
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.140]   who was Sheryl Sandberg.
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.900]   And he referred to the women on his team as girls.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.420]   And she did not hesitate to tell him.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:38.460]   And he came into my office afterwards.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.820]   And I was sitting there with two other people on my team,
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.900]   both of them men,
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.260]   who I had worked with at a previous startup that I had done.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.580]   So I had known them and I had warned them
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.340]   not to call women girls.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.900]   And he came in and he was kind of pale.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.420]   And he was like, this thing just happened.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.820]   And instead of like doing what I should have done,
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.900]   which is own the fact that I had failed him as his boss.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.980]   And what I should have said is, I'm sorry.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.660]   I should have told you, it was my job to tell you.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.780]   And I didn't.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   Instead, I kind of burst out laughing.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.140]   And I turned to these other two guys and I was like,
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.780]   see, aren't you glad I told you?
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.580]   'Cause we had had this argument before.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.780]   And they started laughing.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.300]   And he's like the new guy on the team.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:26.300]   And he said, why in the world, like, did you not tell me?
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.260]   And I did what has been done to me.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.740]   Oh, it's no big deal.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.300]   Don't worry about it.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.380]   And to his credit, he said, look, I would say
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.500]   when you meet your boss's boss for the first time
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:43.500]   and she spends 40 minutes reaming you out for a word,
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.300]   it is a big deal.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.580]   Like you should have told me.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.100]   I would have not used that word
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.420]   if you had given me a heads up.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.940]   And so that was an example of me as a leader
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.940]   failing to disrupt someone's biased language
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.300]   in a way that was hurtful to him.
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:01.740]   And so it was my job to tell him and I failed to do my job.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:05.420]   And I think that's why, if we go back to the story
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.940]   that prompted me to write this book,
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.620]   it's so useful to think about
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.060]   the different roles that we have.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.340]   'Cause like, if he had called me a girl
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:17.140]   and I found it offensive and I wasn't his boss,
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.380]   I could choose to remain silent if I wanted to.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.060]   But because I was his boss,
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.780]   I had more obligation to him to tell him.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:30.780]   And so I think that is helpful to think about as well.
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:35.460]   And what advice would you give to the person who,
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.220]   let's assume it's biased 'cause it's not intentional,
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.940]   but who is in a situation like you've been,
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.340]   made a comment, people are offended.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.220]   You didn't mean it.
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.500]   What's the right way to handle that situation?
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.620]   Because I think I've met people whose perspective is like,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.500]   this is not a big deal, let's move on.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.020]   But the reality is clearly it was a big deal to someone else
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.860]   and it's gonna make the relationship you have
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.660]   with that person not great if you can't resolve it.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.220]   So how do you kind of address that appropriately
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.460]   and kind of be productive?
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:13.140]   Yeah, so I had a boss once who said,
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:17.420]   every single person on this planet has a red word.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.420]   And what he meant by the red word is,
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.380]   if you use that word with that person,
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.300]   they're not gonna hear another word that you say.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.940]   And so one of the things that I tell people
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.340]   is to identify what's your red word.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.740]   So for example, I was working with a group
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.740]   of investment bankers and they really,
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.660]   I think they had, people tend to have an unconscious
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.060]   or maybe conscious bias about investment bankers
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.500]   that they're all assholes.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.380]   And so as soon as you said the word asshole,
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.740]   like that was a red word to these guys.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.380]   They really did not like being,
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.380]   and so I was careful not to use that word with those guys,
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.020]   even though I love the word asshole,
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.580]   but like if my goal is to communicate with those guys,
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:04.860]   I wasn't gonna use the word asshole,
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.180]   even though I'm using it now, I hope they're not listening.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.180]   And so I think it's useful to think about what like,
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.380]   for me, calling me a girl is kind of a red word.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.420]   I don't know why it bugs me so much, but it does.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.860]   So just please don't do it.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:23.020]   Sometimes I'll be working with somebody and I'll say that,
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.860]   and they'll be like, well, so-and-so doesn't mind
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.700]   when I call her a girl.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.620]   And I'm like, well, you're talking to me right now,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.740]   not to so-and-so.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:34.100]   So I think some of this is like just remembering
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.380]   that good communication gets measured,
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.220]   not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:45.220]   I will also say that it's useful to think about
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.820]   what happens when someone else points out bias.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.020]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.380]   but when someone points out to me that I've said
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:57.260]   or done something that's biased, I feel ashamed.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.740]   And when I feel ashamed, I go into like,
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.260]   again, this fight or flight mode.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.460]   Like I can tell you in my body where I feel it.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.060]   I feel a tingling in the backs of my knees.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.700]   It's the same feeling that I get if my children
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.260]   walk too close to the edge of a precipice,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.380]   and I'm afraid they're gonna fall.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   Like it is a real primal sort of fear response.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.100]   And when we're in that kind of shame brain,
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.020]   we rarely respond at our best.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.860]   And so one of the things that I've tried to teach myself
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.660]   to do, and that I try to teach people
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.500]   who I'm working with to do,
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.220]   is to figure out like, what can you do to move?
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.540]   You gotta move through that shame
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.540]   and re-engage your executive function.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.020]   And so sometimes I find it's useful just to have this
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.260]   sort of talk track in my mind.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.780]   Thank you for pointing it out.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.300]   Like that allows me to like buy a little bit of time,
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.740]   like breathe a couple of times.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.260]   And then either I get it, I'm working on not saying it again,
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.020]   but point it out if I fail again.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.700]   And that's an important point also.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.580]   I think that very often when we're trying to change
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:07.460]   deeply ingrained words or patterns of speech,
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.380]   it takes a while.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.500]   And so we have to be patient with ourselves,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.540]   but also persistent.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.900]   So thank you for pointing it out.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.740]   I'm working on it.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.660]   Please tell me if I do it again.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.500]   Or the second thing, thank you for pointing it out.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.980]   I don't know what I did wrong.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.420]   As in the case of, can we have lunch?
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:25.180]   And that's, again, that's a really hard place to be,
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.340]   'cause I'm ashamed because I've upset someone,
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.620]   which wasn't my intention.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.220]   And I'm ashamed because I'm ignorant,
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.660]   which I hate to think of myself as.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.060]   And so learning how to say,
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.460]   can you explain it to me after the meeting?
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.460]   And the reason why I say after the meeting
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.660]   goes back to what you were saying.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.260]   Like, I'm at a startup, I'm busy,
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.740]   I don't have time to have a long conversation.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.500]   The bias disruption needs to be really fast,
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.300]   like just purple flag.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.700]   And then if I don't get it,
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.820]   we can talk after the meeting, not in the meeting,
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.500]   so that we're disrupting the bias,
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.900]   but not every single meeting we ever have together,
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.020]   every single conversation.
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.660]   Wow, okay.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.420]   I feel like my team right now happens to be my wife
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.740]   and my assistant.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.940]   So it's gonna blur the lines,
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.420]   which actually comes back to one topic
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.580]   that before we wrap, I wanted to ask,
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   which is, I don't know how often it gets asked.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.980]   Are there ways you run,
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.380]   whether it's meetings or conversations
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:24.180]   or planning sessions with the family,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.620]   with your husband or conversations with your children
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.740]   that might be a little bit different,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.780]   but embrace some of this?
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.900]   Honestly, if you told me every week
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.980]   I run a meeting with my husband to plan our lives,
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.740]   I'm curious what happens in that meeting,
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.580]   but I'll leave the floor open.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.020]   Yes, so my husband and I also run a business together,
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.140]   so, which I love.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   The way that we do it
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.220]   is we try to take a walk every day together,
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.380]   which is really nice.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.300]   And we talk about all kinds of stuff on the walk,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.700]   including stuff on it.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.500]   So that's kind of when we go through our,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.540]   it's not exactly a meeting,
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.300]   but it's when we kind of make sure
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.940]   that we touch base on the stuff that we're talking,
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.260]   that we need to talk about.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.580]   Like, ah, did you do this?
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.500]   Did you do that?
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.580]   Or should we do this?
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.660]   Or should we do that?
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.380]   Like, is it worth it to hire this PR firm?
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.380]   Or that was a topic of a recent walk and talk that we had.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.180]   So I would say before Andy and I were working together,
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.620]   we were just married.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.140]   And before that we were dating.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.620]   So like I already told you the story about yoga,
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:38.340]   like the little things I think you address
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.860]   in these impromptu two minute conversations.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.500]   Don't save them up,
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.020]   but say the good thing or say the praise,
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.100]   say the criticism right away.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.900]   One of the things that I did right when we got married
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:55.860]   was I kept a gratitude journal.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.020]   And I would write down before I went to sleep
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.500]   all the things that Andy had done that day
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.100]   that I was grateful to him for having done.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.580]   And then I realized this is ridiculous.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.980]   Like, I don't need to write a journal.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:08.820]   I'm married.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.340]   I need to tell him these things.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:16.220]   And so I would make a point to tell those things.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.900]   I think gratitude is a really important part
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.980]   of any good relationship.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:25.900]   And gratitude often takes the form of giving praise.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:30.220]   To me, it's kind of the same thing.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:34.540]   I also try to make sure that I'm asking Andy
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.100]   on a regular basis.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.620]   Like sometimes I'll say something and I can tell
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.740]   it didn't land the way I intended it to.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.060]   And I'm like, what are you thinking?
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.220]   Don't imagine just 'cause you've been married
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.220]   for 15 or 20 or 30 years
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.100]   that you know what that other person is thinking.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.740]   Like I barely know what I'm thinking half the time.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.140]   I definitely don't know what he's thinking.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:59.100]   So I think soliciting feedback, giving a lot of praise
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.700]   and not letting things pile up,
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.060]   like not holding onto things for very long
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.980]   is really important.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.260]   You wanna make sure that you talk about something
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.500]   that bugs you while it's still a little thing.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.060]   Don't let it become a big thing.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.900]   I think radical candor should feel sort of like,
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.420]   it should not feel like a root canal.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.460]   It should feel like brushing and flossing,
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.980]   like basic relationship hygiene.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.660]   And the way you know you're succeeding
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.220]   is that when you don't say the thing,
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.540]   you feel a little gross.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.700]   Kind of like you feel if you leave the house
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.420]   before you've brushed your teeth.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.260]   It needs to become sort of a habit, I think,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.700]   of a relationship.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.700]   And then you don't have to have these big, deep,
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.540]   crucial conversations,
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:51.180]   'cause you've had a lot of little conversations.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.620]   And I think most of us,
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.780]   especially if there's a little conflict to resolve
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   or a little criticism to share,
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.180]   we'd rather have a lot of little conversations.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.500]   Than, you know, one big one.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.340]   And when you have kids,
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.780]   it's time for a big conversation.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.900]   Where are you gonna find it?
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.780]   Golly, you don't have.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.380]   You definitely don't have.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.260]   And with your children, I would say this.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.940]   Like I made a joke earlier that nobody in your life
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.700]   wants to give you criticism except your children.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.940]   Like, welcome that.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.260]   That is really, this is how we move forward as a species.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:28.460]   Is that it is the job of the younger generation
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.860]   to criticize the older generation.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:34.300]   So I think the more you can be open to criticism
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.180]   from your, you don't have to agree with them.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.380]   I mean, you are wiser than they are,
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.660]   but they have a fresh new perspective
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.340]   and trying to be open to that
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.300]   can make it really, really useful.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.780]   I will also say that one of the gifts
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.060]   that my children gave me when they were two,
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.060]   when they were like in that toddler rage stage.
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.940]   Mine are one and three, so I'm there.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.180]   Okay, so this is for you, yeah.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.900]   So I found that, I mean, they have such intense emotions,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.860]   like from zero to 90.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.540]   And I learned, you know, when they flail,
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.940]   lay down on the floor of the grocery store
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.900]   and start kicking their legs and screaming,
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.060]   that it is really useful just not to react,
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.900]   just to like count to 60, not to six, but to 60.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.180]   Like if you can manage not to react for 60 seconds,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:33.180]   they won't be able to maintain that pitch of emotion.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.860]   So it's just like, let it wash over you.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.180]   And then once they are calmer,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.900]   you can kind of re-engage with them.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.060]   So, and I found that so helpful
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.420]   in my CEO coaching practice as well.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:51.060]   Senior leaders often behave very much like two-year-olds.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.100]   And so that was one of the many gifts
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.540]   that I got from my children.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.380]   I love that.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.340]   - If you ever write "The House of Radical Candor,"
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.620]   I'm excited to read it, but this has been fantastic.
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.620]   Where do we want to send people
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.500]   who are excited about all of this and want more?
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.820]   - Yeah, check out radicalcandor.com.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.100]   I am not much on Twitter anymore,
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.100]   but I do a lot of posting on LinkedIn.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.180]   So you can find me, Kim Scott, on LinkedIn.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:25.180]   And there's also a website, radicalrespectbook.com.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.720]   But if you want to find everything in one place,
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.060]   radicalcandor.com is probably the best place to go.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.420]   - Awesome, I'm excited for the book.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.900]   It comes out when?
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.620]   - May 7th, but you can pre-order it today.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.740]   So don't wait.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.220]   - Awesome, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.460]   - Thank you, really enjoyed the conversation.
