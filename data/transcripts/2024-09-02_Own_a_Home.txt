[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.960]   Join the experience at visitparkcity.com.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.480]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.160]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.840]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.600]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.960]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.680]   and today on the podcast, we continue our series
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.840]   of financial goals that everyone should set.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   This is a series dedicated to shortish,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   simple podcasts devoted to one single foundational concept
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.480]   of a goal that everyone should set.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.540]   These are as close to universally applicable goals
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.640]   as I can come up with.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520]   And the idea behind this series is that
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.720]   by giving you clear and specific goals,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.200]   you are more likely to accomplish a financial abundance
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.040]   by someone simply telling you here's a goal you should set,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   and here's why.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.880]   So let's have a quick recap,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.760]   'cause it's been a little while
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.440]   since we have visited this series.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.480]   Goal number one was get a job.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.440]   All else being equal, if you wanna make progress financially,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.460]   you begin by getting a job.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.440]   Goal two is when you get that job,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.260]   set a goal to live on half your income.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.580]   Spend no more than half your income.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.180]   Save half, spend half.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.480]   Just from the beginning, 50% of your income.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.760]   If you're not able to do that in the immediate here and now,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.380]   work towards that.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.040]   Goal number three was give away 10% of your income.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.660]   We talked a lot about the enormous benefit
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.080]   of consistently giving money away.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.360]   So goal three, give away 10% of your income.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.520]   Do it consistently, reliably from the very beginning.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   Goal four, begin a job or career that has the potential
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.600]   to help you to become, in the fullness of time,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.420]   a top 20% income earner.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.000]   Basically, if you're working at a dead-end job,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.420]   then set a goal to start a job
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.560]   that could lead to your earning top 20% wages
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.160]   for your context.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.200]   You wanna have a growth path in front of you.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.000]   So you can switch from your dead-end job
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.960]   to a job that has a long-term potential.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.480]   And that way, over the next decade or the next two decades,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.860]   however long it takes you,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.240]   you will know that you have the ability to grow
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.880]   and to become a top 20% earner,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.400]   which in the fullness of time,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.320]   will solve virtually all of your financial problems.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.720]   Goal number five, get as much
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.200]   of the highest quality education that you possibly can
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.880]   as soon as you can.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.920]   Education, more education, is always a good idea.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.480]   And so you should get as much of it,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.620]   of the best quality education, as quickly as you can,
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.240]   as early in your life as you can.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.760]   Goal number six, fully fund a Roth IRA.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.880]   We talked about the power of a Roth IRA.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.200]   That was the first of these discussions
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   that is US-specific.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.640]   So for my international listeners,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   you will have some version of that in your area,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.400]   and we'll come back to other kinds of retirement accounts
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.320]   later in the series.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.880]   Goal seven, I encourage you to own a dwelling place,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.200]   free and clear.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   And I use that weird word, dwelling place,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.920]   to include a house,
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.680]   but I specifically talked about the value
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.240]   of just having some place that is safe.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.840]   And that safe place, for some people,
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.720]   might be a car that you could live in,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.280]   or a tent that you could set up.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   For some people, it might be a small cabin somewhere.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   And for most of us, it will be a house that you own,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.360]   a place that you own consistently.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   But I wanted to make it clear
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.200]   that if you don't yet have the ability to own a house,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.960]   you should at least have some kind of dwelling place
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.720]   that you can live in,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.280]   or that you could retreat to
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.840]   if your current rented space doesn't work out for you.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.960]   Goal eight, I talked about being debt-free for life.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.880]   And I said that if you avoid borrowing money,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   everything works better in life.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.920]   And so we talked extensively
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.560]   about becoming debt-free for life.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.000]   Today, we're gonna give goal nine,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   and probably this is gonna be 9A,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.320]   but I'm just gonna characterize it as goal nine,
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.360]   which is buy a house.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.640]   Now, everything I said in goal seven
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.320]   of dwelling place still applies,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   but here specifically today,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.040]   I'm going to talk about the value
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   of your simply buying a house.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.560]   And to define my terms,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.280]   what I mean is that you are the owner of a residence.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.480]   I think that for most people,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.320]   the goal should be to buy a house,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280]   a separate single family house of some kind.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.000]   That's the type of real estate structure
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.520]   that has the longest potential
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.440]   and the best long-term potential
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.680]   for most people in most areas.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   There will certainly be many contexts
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.040]   in which that's not really doable.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.200]   And so if you need, given your context,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.720]   to hear the term house as buy a condominium to live in,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.640]   buy an apartment that you can live in,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.680]   or something else, that's fine.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.360]   But I don't want you to just buy a box truck
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   and live in that.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   I think it's nice to have a box truck
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.880]   that you could live in.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.080]   And for somebody who's living in an apartment,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.960]   having a box truck stuck away somewhere
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   that you could live in
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.200]   is probably a really useful backup plan.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.360]   And it could be really fun
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.880]   in terms of being part of your life.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.120]   It could even be a fun thing,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   meaning what I mean is you go and travel with it,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.400]   and maybe that provides you with a comfortable place
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.000]   that you can work on the road.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.440]   It can be a fun adventure to do something like that
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.480]   for a couple of years, to live in an RV,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   or to live on a boat.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   But in the fullness of time,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.160]   you're most likely going to want to buy a house.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.800]   I've been doing this for a little while,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.000]   and one of the things I've noticed
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.840]   is that for people who make the idea
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   of just a dwelling place,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.760]   and they're open to any idea,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.360]   they make that their goal and they stop there,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.680]   things change over time.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.520]   As much as I myself think it's cool
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   to live on a narrow boat,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.800]   or to live on a sailboat,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.760]   or again, live in an RV,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.440]   or do some kind of unique alternative lifestyle,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   I think that's cool,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.880]   but it's not a great long-term plan
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.320]   for the vast majority of people.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.080]   Most people long-term are going to be best provided for
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.560]   by owning a house,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.280]   a traditional house that's connected
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   to the earth in some way.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.920]   So use those other strategies as a great backup plan.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   Use it as a great launching plan.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.040]   In the previous episode,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.680]   I talked about a firefighter
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.880]   who was living in his back of his pickup truck.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.360]   He did that for a couple of years,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.800]   saved probably a couple hundred thousand dollars,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.920]   then used it to go on and move on to the next step.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   So use those things strategically.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.400]   But you should have a goal to buy a house.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.080]   Whenever I think of universally applicable advice,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.960]   I always argue both sides or all sides of the issue.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.400]   And so the first thing I think of is simply,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.480]   when is it not a good idea to buy a house?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.560]   Generally speaking, there are very few scenarios
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.120]   that I can create, hypothetically,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.880]   in which it's not a good idea to buy a house.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.280]   If I were going to create such a scenario,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.600]   it would include many of the obvious factors
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.120]   that you intuitively know.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.600]   For example, you might be broke.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.160]   Well, if you're broke, you probably shouldn't buy a house,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.680]   but that's why we've already talked about these other goals
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.320]   and why I positioned this at goal nine, not at goal one.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.120]   So if you're broke, you don't have any money saved,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   you don't have a job, you don't have any income,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.920]   then this advice is out.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.480]   It should be a goal for you to do
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.440]   after you've accomplished that.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.280]   If I were going to create a scenario
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.800]   in which it were a bad idea to buy a house,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.280]   I would have to inject a huge amount of uncertainty
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.800]   because buying a house for a very short-term period
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.880]   is usually not a great idea.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.520]   So if you know that there's a good chance
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.920]   that I'm going to move across the country
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.720]   three months from now to take a new and exciting job,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.760]   you wouldn't buy a house.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   If you knew there's a good chance
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.120]   I'm going to get divorced in six months,
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.800]   you wouldn't buy a house.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.160]   If you have any sense of clear impending uncertainty,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.120]   then you wouldn't buy a house.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.920]   The third set of hypothetical situations
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.720]   that I could design in which it might be a bad idea
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.920]   to buy a house are actually the hardest for me,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   meaning I have to acknowledge and concede
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.160]   that these things could be true
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.240]   while simultaneously saying
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.920]   they're probably not true for you,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.320]   and that is market conditions.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.720]   There can clearly be some kind of market condition
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.240]   where it would be a bad idea to buy a house.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.080]   If housing prices are very, very high
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.440]   and there's some reason why those housing prices
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.320]   are going to fall catastrophically,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.560]   then you would say it's a bad idea to buy a house.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.920]   And for my generation,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.600]   this is basically the defining characteristic
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.440]   because many people in my generation
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.480]   bought their houses for the first time
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.600]   somewhere around the Great Recession,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.920]   the great real estate crash of the 21st century,
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.120]   at least the first one so far.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.840]   And many people went out,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   bought houses they couldn't afford,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.600]   note the first hypothetical I said,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.280]   and wound up losing those houses
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.960]   because the house has plummeted in value.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.200]   Now, interestingly now,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.840]   we have enough distance from that event,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.600]   from those events, to see that on the whole,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.920]   if you could just keep the house,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   things would have worked out.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.400]   And this is why we come back to it being,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.840]   in essence, a universally good idea
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.440]   for you to buy a house.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.960]   If overall you have general stability
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   in your life and your plans, where you live,
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.080]   what you're doing, what job you're doing,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.360]   and if overall you can afford to buy a house,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.600]   you should move forward and simply buy a house.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.040]   Statistically speaking,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.360]   if it winds up being a financial mistake,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   it's most likely going to be a modest financial mistake.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.720]   A modest financial mistake would be the kind of thing
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.680]   where you buy a house, you have all the fees to get it,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.360]   you put some money into getting it livable,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.680]   and then a year later, you turn around and move.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.400]   That might cost you some money,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.080]   and you may have been better off renting,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.280]   but on the whole, that would have been a modest mistake.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.080]   In virtually all other scenarios, though,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.120]   you're going to be better off having purchased the house,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.440]   lived in the house, and in the long run,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.960]   you're going to be really well off
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.200]   by that one simple decision.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.600]   Now, astute, very long-time listeners
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.720]   of "Radical Personal Finance" should be pointing out
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.240]   at this very moment that this is different
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.240]   from the tone and attitude and advice that I gave
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.120]   in the early history of "Radical Personal Finance."
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.960]   This is one of those significant things
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   that I've changed my perspective on in time.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   Early in the podcast history,
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.180]   I recorded podcasts about why purchasing a house
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.680]   very well might not be a good idea,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.720]   and I talked about things like flexibility.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.160]   When people own a house, they might be less likely
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.260]   to be willing to move across country to take a better job.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.280]   I talked about the costs of a house.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.840]   In some cases, living in a rented house
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.280]   can be significantly better than a purchased house
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.200]   because of all of the straight-up costs
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.120]   of purchasing a house.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.360]   I went into the calculations of purchasing a house,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.440]   and I showed how, if you factor in the pure costs of a house,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.080]   things like insurance and property taxes
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.240]   and even interest payment on debt,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.840]   in many circumstances, those pure costs
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.440]   are similar to the cost of renting.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.720]   And while that analysis wasn't entirely wrong,
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   what I wound up doing by going down that pathway of advice
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.400]   was underestimating the long-term value of owning a house,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.440]   and that's why I have changed this and corrected this.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.920]   One of the books that I really appreciated
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.740]   that helped me in this process
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.840]   was a book written by John Reed
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.160]   called "An American Principal Residence
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   "Is the Most Advantaged Investment on Earth.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.880]   "Maximize Yours."
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.800]   And I want to share with you a few of Mr. Reed's comments
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   from this book in the context of purchasing a house
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.400]   to live in from a financial perspective,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.360]   to say nothing of the lifestyle benefits.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.760]   Let's begin with a little bit of Mr. Reed's story.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.240]   He writes, "When I was a cadet at West Point
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.100]   "from 1964 to 1968, I changed my mind
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.480]   "about making a career of the Army.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.160]   "I also wanted to get started studying
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.440]   "whatever civilian career I was going to choose
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.840]   "while I was still at West Point and in the Army.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.980]   "When my senior year at West Point started,
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.020]   "no civilian career had captured my fancy.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.020]   "So I decided I needed to force a choice.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.520]   "I knew I wanted to get rich young,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.500]   "financially independent, I called it.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.720]   "So I researched how to go about that
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.460]   "in the West Point library."
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.260]   Admittedly, a far cry from what the Army had in mind
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.300]   when they decided cadets needed a library.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.900]   "One article ended up being my main influence.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.400]   "In 1967, I believe, Time Magazine did a cover story
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.240]   "about young millionaires.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.360]   "One was the guy who started Airstream Trailers.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.260]   "Another was a Manhattan sandwich shop
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.600]   "with a line around the block during weekday lunches.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.060]   "At the end of the article,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.860]   "a summation paragraph said the way to do this
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.660]   "was to have your own business or to invest in real estate."
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.720]   Couple of comments here.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.580]   I think that this is something that many people,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.080]   many young, aggressive young men often do.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.620]   As they say, I wanna get rich.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.780]   So what's the most direct pathway to getting rich?
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.220]   This is something that I myself did.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.620]   I had many friends who did it.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.580]   And as Mr. Reed talks about,
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.920]   you often wind up in the areas in which information
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   and inspiration are most easily sold.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.140]   You wind up taking a real estate investment seminar,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.180]   a stock trading seminar,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.420]   an options or futures trading seminar,
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   or business seminar of some kind.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.600]   And this, by the way, I find very frustrating
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.620]   because while those could be pathways,
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.460]   I think generally they're pathways for people
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.440]   who don't have other good options.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.700]   And so we really should give more attention
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.780]   to good career planning
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.460]   because you can become wealthy in the fullness of time
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.940]   through almost any career.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.980]   And in many cases, much more easily
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.440]   than pursuing one of these sensationalized careers.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.800]   Back to the story.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.600]   Army officers cannot have their own business.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.280]   Upon graduation from West Point,
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.620]   you become a second lieutenant in the army.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.500]   When I graduated,
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.440]   you had to be an active duty officer for five years.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.260]   So my plan was to study real estate investment
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.620]   in my spare time as a cadet and as an officer.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.900]   Then get out of the army
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.900]   on the fifth anniversary of my graduation, June 5th, 1973.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.260]   I also planned to buy my first real estate investment,
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.160]   a duplex, which I did on April 15, 1969,
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.300]   while I was a second lieutenant in the army.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.500]   I never lived in it.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.580]   It was 16 Harvard Avenue
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.740]   in the town where my mom lived, Collingswood, New Jersey.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.260]   And she received the rent
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.700]   and occasionally called someone to get something fixed
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.020]   while I was in Vietnam.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.140]   One thing you'll notice from the story, by the way,
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.580]   is that most things in life favor those who take action.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.940]   And in general, people who own real estate, things work out.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.180]   And so you'll always see that as a consistent pathway.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.020]   The key is to be the kind of person
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.860]   who goes ahead and takes action.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.980]   When I'm counseling somebody
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.820]   who's thinking about buying a piece of real estate
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   or buying a rental or not buying,
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.260]   I usually advise, buy it, try it.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.300]   Because in general, it's simple and understandable.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.740]   It's hard to mess it up entirely.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.180]   And you'll learn a lot from the actual process of doing it,
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.380]   lessons that can't be gained in any other way.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.320]   Fixers, the basic plan I was following was to buy income,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.900]   rental properties in need of fix up, fix them,
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.100]   raise the rents and thereby the property value,
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.680]   then trade up to another more expensive income property
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.980]   and repeat.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.940]   An income property is an apartment building
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.560]   or a smaller rental property like a duplex or triplex.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.900]   William Nickerson wrote several books on that.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.840]   And I was following his formula.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.880]   If you're interested in that,
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.180]   I recommend my own book, "Fixers" to you.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.940]   Nice, but I wanted to be big time.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.220]   Just owning a duplex made me feel special,
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.980]   but I was anxious to move up to apartment buildings.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.380]   Then I would be commercial, a big shot,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.020]   a mogul, not a mere duplex owner.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.260]   Joe Schmo owns a duplex.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.140]   I wanted to be big time.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.700]   This book is about only owning a principal residence
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.780]   throughout your whole life.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.640]   It is a manifestation of my concluding from hard experience
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.500]   that the only property I needed to buy
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.700]   or should have bought was a series of principal residences.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.900]   I did buy and live in a series of homes.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.980]   1972, a home in New Jersey.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.140]   1973, another home in New Jersey.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.400]   I'm going to skip all the addresses.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.580]   1974, a home in New Jersey.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.740]   1980, a house in California.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.260]   1983, a home in California.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.620]   My wife and I designed Bryan Drive,
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.260]   the final house that he purchased,
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.420]   and had it built as a brand new home,
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.460]   raised our three sons there, and we still live in it.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.300]   But I also owned a duplex in Collingswood, New Jersey,
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   another in Haddon Heights, New Jersey,
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.780]   a 12-unit apartment building in Mount Holly, New Jersey,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.580]   a 37-unit apartment building,
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.140]   the Greenbrier in Corsicana, Texas,
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.980]   the 25-unit Cottonwoods Apartments in DeSoto, Texas,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:08.700]   the 33-unit Las Brisas apartment in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.180]   So we can see from Reed's accounting
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.220]   of his history of property ownership that he did it.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.520]   He accomplished the dream
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.180]   of owning dozens and dozens of doors.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.020]   He hit the big time.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.620]   Tenants and employees are too often a pain in the neck.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.660]   We got sued.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.080]   We had to fire bad employees
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.960]   and try to replace them with good ones.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.160]   The main problem was the savings and loan debacle
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.060]   in Texas in the 1980s.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.380]   To make a long story short,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.980]   we lost $750,000 in apartment buildings in Texas.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.660]   And I checked and learned that if,
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.420]   instead of the apartment buildings I owned there,
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.700]   I had owned single-family homes across the street
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.320]   from my apartment buildings,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.260]   I would have lost little or no money.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.700]   That is when I decided my wanting to be a big shot,
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.100]   mogul, commercial, apartment building-owning guy
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.900]   was the biggest financial mistake of my life.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.000]   Classmate and I bought at the same time,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.660]   but different results.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.940]   More recently, a college classmate and I
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.900]   each bought separate, unrelated homes
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.840]   in the San Francisco area for about the same price
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.260]   in the same month in 1983.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.060]   My wife and I bought Bryan Drive,
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.780]   the brand new house I described above in Alamo,
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.860]   a suburb of San Francisco.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.920]   My classmate and his wife bought an old house
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.600]   in one of San Francisco's more prestigious neighborhoods,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.300]   St. Francis Wood.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.780]   Another long story short,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.900]   when they sold theirs for over 4 million in the mid-20 teens,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.860]   ours was worth about $1.8 million.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.060]   Why the difference?
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.220]   Partly, they did more fix-up on their old house
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.940]   than we did on our new one.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.060]   Mainly, the Silicon Valley economic boom
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.660]   affected the city of San Francisco
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.300]   more than our East Bay suburb.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.660]   I was happy for them.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.860]   I preferred our new house in the nice weather,
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.580]   uncongested East Bay hills
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.660]   to the cold, blustery old neighborhood they lived in.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.840]   They sort of felt the same way,
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.460]   and that was why they sold it.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.220]   They relocated to La Jolla,
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.120]   a gorgeous oceanfront neighborhood in San Diego.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.980]   But think about the numbers.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.480]   They made more on that one house
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.420]   than I made and lost on my apartment buildings.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.540]   Hell, so did I with my less spectacular gain
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.980]   in one suburban house.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.060]   Plus, I had no tenants and no employees
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.900]   and no lawsuits with my principal residents.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.660]   Now, pay careful attention to this next section.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.740]   I should have only bought principal residences.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.820]   The light bulb went on.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.900]   I should have bought nothing but single-family,
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.460]   owner-occupied principal residences.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.460]   My principal residences cost $32,000, $30,000,
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:21:00.860]   $36,000, $122,000, and $356,000, if I recall correctly.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.740]   But during that time, I also bought 68 rental units.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.100]   If I had put all those down payments
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.900]   and negative cash flow into my personal residences,
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.060]   I could have bought something like double
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.700]   or triple on the last three houses,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.020]   call it 2 1/2 times bigger.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.660]   That would have been $90,000, $305,000,
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:29.660]   and the $890,000 purchase in 1983 in Greater Silicon Valley
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.660]   would today be worth something like $10 million.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.100]   Suppose I had pursued that strategy my whole adult life
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.940]   knowing what I know now.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.660]   I can't do that now because I am 74 years old.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.580]   But with my help in the form of this book, you can.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.500]   And maybe my three sons can, too.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.700]   Also, the list of advantages of an owner-occupied
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.180]   single-family principal residence is extremely long
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.380]   and beats not only apartment buildings,
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.860]   but also stocks, bonds, commodities,
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.860]   and almost all other investments.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.260]   The only reason to invest in other types of assets
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.100]   is to diversify against the risks of principal residences.
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.980]   They do have some risks, and there
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.940]   is a chapter about those risks in this book.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.420]   Now, I'll give you the list of advantages in just a minute,
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.580]   but I want you to pay attention to that.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.980]   Reed made his business first by investing in real estate
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.540]   after he got out of the army.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.540]   Then he became a real estate guru,
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.380]   publishing books on real estate and maintaining
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.820]   an active real estate newsletter.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.140]   And here at the end of his career, at 70 years old,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.160]   he discovers that all he had to do was buy a house
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.820]   and live in it, and then systematically upgrade
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.380]   that house over time.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.500]   And that's basically the essence of his book.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.140]   When I read that book, combined with other influences,
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.220]   I realized I cannot short circuit these benefits.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.900]   And that's when I became a much more consistent advisor
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.580]   to say you should purchase a house and live in it.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.000]   Now, one more paragraph here, and then the list of benefits.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.140]   Main asset for most older Americans.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.500]   For most Americans in their 60s, their net worth
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.420]   is composed mainly of their principal residence, equity.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.220]   A website called newretirement.com
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.740]   says in 2020, the average American 65 to 74 years old
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:34.100]   had $51,948 in savings and $153,300 in home equity,
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.460]   amounting to 72% of their net worth.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.380]   Only about 36% of retirees have an IRA.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.340]   Those have an average balance of $123,973,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.060]   although those held over 20 years
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.740]   have an average balance of $283,200.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.220]   The average 401(k) for people in their 60s has $182,100.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.720]   Why is home equity the largest asset most seniors have?
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.900]   Three main reasons.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.420]   One, mortgage amortization is forced savings.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.780]   Two, appreciation.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.100]   Three, leverage.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.700]   Each time you make a mortgage payment
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.380]   on a 30-year fixed-rate self-amortizing mortgage,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.340]   you pay down the balance of the mortgage loan.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.740]   That is like savings, but no one makes
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.660]   you put money into savings.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.140]   Your mortgage lender most certainly
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.900]   does make you pay the mortgage payment.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.260]   That's good for you, like exercise and watching
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.020]   your weight, although you should also keep your home equity
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.660]   percentage of the current value of the home as low as is still
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.500]   safe at all times because appreciation is generally
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.380]   far larger than amortization.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.140]   By the way, you can set up automatic deposits
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.060]   into your savings account by various means, and you should.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.900]   So the key fact that we need to wrestle with
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.060]   is if you look at the actual finances of Americans
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.260]   in the back part of their life, you
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.860]   find that their home equity is generally
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.300]   the single most valuable asset for them.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.860]   Now, when I was younger, I found this very hard to believe
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.660]   because I was obsessed with stocks and retirement accounts
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.620]   and all the many benefits of that.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.140]   I dramatically underappreciated the value
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.300]   of a forced savings system, of making mortgage payments,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.900]   and of stability, of just living in a place
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.940]   and letting assets grow.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.940]   I was intoxicated with the idea of high returns.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.780]   Today, with a few more years under my belt,
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.580]   a few hundred more financial consultations,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:36.500]   and I realize the enormous importance of owning a house
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.900]   that you live in, and I believe that it's entirely
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.460]   appropriate for you to count that house as part
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.140]   of your financial savings.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.500]   Now, Reed continues and talks about why home equity is
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.100]   the biggest asset for most seniors
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.860]   and talks about all kinds of the benefits,
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.500]   and he lays out the basic strategy
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.940]   that he wants you to focus on.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.220]   This book urges you to maximize your principal residence value
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.580]   and to minimize your equity percentage safely
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.300]   throughout your adult life.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.540]   But there are three ways to do that,
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.500]   and I only want you to use the first.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.500]   The three ways are one, location; two, size; three,
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.780]   finish and amenities.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.700]   Some of the houses that cost a million dollars
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.380]   cost that much because they're in a great location,
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.580]   even though they have a normal size lot, say a third of an acre
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.220]   and normal finish.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.140]   I want you to stick to normal size houses,
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.980]   1,500 to 3,500 square feet, and normal size lots,
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.980]   fifth of an acre to one acre.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.340]   Finish refers to extravagant fixtures like gold faucets
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.020]   or extravagant amenities like an indoor basketball court
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.860]   or pool or multiple kitchens or a restaurant-type kitchen.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.420]   In other words, I want you to buy more and more expensive
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.500]   houses, but I want that increased value
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.060]   to be in the location, not the size of the building
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.380]   or the lot, and not in terms of lavish, extravagant fixtures
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.140]   or amenities.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.460]   For example, in my area, San Francisco,
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.500]   your final $10 million or so house
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.020]   would probably be in Palo Alto, where many Silicon Valley
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.940]   billionaires live, or a view property on San Francisco
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.620]   Bay, like in Tiburon or Belvedere.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.700]   And it would be a 2,500 or 3,000-square-foot house
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.260]   on a half-an-acre lot.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.380]   It goes on, talks about the benefits of a house.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.780]   You can live in it, store things in it, work in it.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.860]   You don't have to sell it to use it.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.260]   Gives all kinds of ideas on active profit strategies.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.740]   And then the rest of the book--
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.060]   that's just from the initial chapter of overview--
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.420]   the rest of the book is dedicated towards all kinds
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.060]   of detail and advice on how to do it.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.620]   The benefits of homes over other assets, leverage, use value,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.700]   active profit strategy, price variations, life phases,
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.300]   transaction costs, risks, working at home, school
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.500]   district, climate, property taxes, energy, insurance,
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.580]   telecommunications, parking, living off your land,
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.620]   durability, pool, and a conclusion.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.660]   It's a good book, as are most of his books.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.820]   But the basic lesson is buy a house
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:05.100]   and factor that into your overall planning portfolio.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.660]   Younger Joshua, in the early days
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.220]   of radical personal finance, said to himself and also
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.020]   in public that we should exclude the value
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.820]   of personal consumption assets from our financial planning
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.540]   framework.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.660]   So if I have a house that I'm living in,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.260]   I should think of that as just simply a consumption asset,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.060]   not as an investment asset.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.620]   This is basically an extrapolation
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.540]   of the classic Robert Kiyosaki idea of assets
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.300]   and what they actually-- and liabilities.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.460]   And while there's usefulness in thinking that way sometimes,
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.620]   it understates how valuable buying a house
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.700]   is in the long term.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.260]   So to make it simple, I think you
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   should set a goal of owning a home, buying a home.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.380]   And if you don't have all the money that you need for it,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.340]   then I think you should be perfectly
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.140]   fine with taking out a mortgage and financing the property.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.580]   And you should have a goal of owning a home.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.060]   This decision should be the default choice for all people
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.060]   who have an income and who have a little bit of money saved
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.260]   and who are at least somewhat consistent in their lifestyle
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.700]   and have at least basic expectations of what
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.980]   the next few years could be.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.880]   So let's walk through a life cycle,
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.620]   and let's talk about the applications of this.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.740]   If you are young and you start working when you're young
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.860]   and you start saving money when you're young,
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.940]   and let's assume that you become an adult
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.580]   and you're thinking about going to college,
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.060]   I think that you should consider very seriously owning a home.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.180]   Some colleges may have rules about your living
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.380]   on campus the first year.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:40.900]   That's fine.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.580]   Go live on campus the first year.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.860]   But after the first year, buy a home near the campus.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   And then go ahead and get a couple of roommates.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.180]   Live off campus, own the home, have your roommates pay you
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.060]   a rental payment, and enjoy the benefits of having an asset
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.060]   that you now own instead of purely renting or paying money
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.340]   to the school for the school's real estate.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.620]   That's a good strategy.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.420]   Now, when you finish college, you can sell it
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.700]   or you can keep it.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.940]   That's always the choice that you have when you're
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.820]   ready to move out of a house.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.260]   And while you can go both ways, you
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.740]   don't have to generally choose in the short term.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.500]   So you finished up college, great.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.340]   Keep the apartment.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.180]   Keep the house.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.140]   Keep it rented out to college students.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.180]   Have a management company or do it yourself from afar.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.820]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.900]   Let's say that you're moving around getting a job.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.820]   No problem.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.940]   If you move to a new city, stay in a long-term Airbnb
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.700]   for three months or six months.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.740]   That's fine.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.020]   But in the meantime, if you're looking around
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.500]   and you have a job and you think,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500]   I could be here for at least a few years,
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.020]   go ahead, purchase a home.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.100]   That's actually a great time to go ahead and list
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.640]   the first house that you bought when
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.300]   you were in college for sale.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.260]   After all, you're living in an Airbnb.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.280]   So you can just simply take that time
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.140]   to go through the selling process
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.700]   and then go ahead and purchase your second house
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.140]   while you're still deciding, is this job going to work out
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.980]   going through the probationary period.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.380]   If you know that you're only going to be somewhere for a year
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.020]   or 18 months or two years and you're
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.440]   sure that you're only going to be there for a short time,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.580]   then that's a good reason to rent.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.640]   Better to just rent inexpensively
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.780]   or, if necessary, pursue some kind of alternative housing.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.740]   But if you're going to a place and you're
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.420]   not sure if it's going to be two years or four years,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.780]   go ahead and buy a house.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.380]   It'll probably work out.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.540]   And if it doesn't, you probably won't lose much.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.100]   Going on through life, be willing to just simply repeat
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.100]   that process.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.380]   And each time you sell a house, trade up.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.340]   Trade up to a house that is in a better location.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.960]   And make sure that you generally always own a home.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.500]   If you are renting, it should be a strategic decision
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.180]   for a specific reason.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.980]   I'm only here for one year for a contract.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.600]   I'm specifically looking for a house,
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.020]   but I've just moved to a new area,
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.020]   and I don't know where specifically I want to live yet.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   It should be a strategic move to rent
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.700]   rather than the default option.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.740]   The default mindset that you should instill and install
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.340]   into yourself, into your children,
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.620]   and into anyone around you that you want to win with money
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.300]   is that all people should have a goal
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.420]   to purchase and own a home.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.120]   Do that process consistently over a lifetime,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.740]   and there's a pretty decent chance
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.040]   that you will have millions and millions of dollars
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.140]   of real estate equity that will perform
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.500]   a very valuable function for your financial planning
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.180]   in the fullness of time.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.560]   There's much more that could be said.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.660]   Comments about the tax deductions,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.940]   the leveraging ability, the security, the asset protection.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.820]   I could make this podcast four hours.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.700]   I'm choosing to make it 30 minutes
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.700]   in hopes that it will reach more people
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.460]   and allow you to interact with those you love around you.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.300]   So in conclusion, goal number nine,
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.560]   goal that everyone should set,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   own a house, a home for yourself and your family.
