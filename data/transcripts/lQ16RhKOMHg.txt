[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.760]   The Son of God claimed rightly to be the light of the world.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.840]   The Son was sent to be the atonement for our sins.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.360]   God is saying by the darkness that the cross is a place of divine judgment.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.020]   And that divine judgment is falling on that very person hanging on that cross.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.340]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.860]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:57.320]   I want to thank you for joining me today.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.100]   I want to draw your attention back to Matthew 27.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.760]   This will be a kind of meditation to prepare us for our time together in the Lord's table.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:24.800]   I want to look in particular at just one brief section, and that starts down in verse 45.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.300]   Matthew 27, 45.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.360]   Let me read these verses to you.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.300]   Now from the sixth hour, darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.120]   About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying,
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.080]   Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.300]   That is, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.100]   And some of those who were standing there when they heard it began saying,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.700]   this man is calling for Elijah.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.280]   Immediately one of them ran and said,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   take him away, take him away.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.

[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280]   And Elijah said, take him away.

[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.960]   And I want us to look at the features in the account that I just read that reveal God's
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.140]   own commentary on the cross while it was happening.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.500]   There are a number of things that explain the significance of the cross.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.360]   Let's go back to verse 45 and see the first one.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.240]   And this is God giving us at the very time of the narrative.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.960]   The meaning of it.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:37.320]   Verse 45, a very simple statement: "From the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   until the ninth hour."
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.420]   Now this is the first divine act, supernatural darkness, supernatural darkness.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.200]   This is not natural.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   There is no human explanation for this.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:03.080]   This is a divine miracle, and as such is a divine commentary on what is happening there.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:11.220]   Now remember, the Son of God claimed rightly to be the light of the world, John 8:12: "I
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.120]   am the light of the world; whoever walks in Me will not walk in darkness."
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.540]   He is the light that comes into the world.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.620]   John begins his gospel that way.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.160]   "And all who are in Him are saved."
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   "In the light."
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.800]   "We have fellowship with Him in the light," John says in his epistle.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.260]   So our Lord was identified as light, the light of knowledge, divine knowledge, and the light
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.200]   of virtue, divine virtue.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.160]   But from the sixth hour to the ninth hour, darkness.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.680]   That would be 12:00 noon to 3:00 in the afternoon Jewish time.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.120]   Mark 15:25 says He was actually crucified.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.960]   The third hour, that's 9:00 a.m. in the morning.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   So for three hours He has been hanging on the cross, suffering physically, suffering
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.640]   physically, and certainly emotionally.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.500]   During those first three hours He said three things.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:21.480]   First thing He said is to those who had crucified Him and were standing around the cross, "Father,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.080]   forgive them.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.580]   For they know not what they do."
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.480]   Luke 23:34.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   And then He said to the thief who said, "Would you remember Me when you come into your kingdom?"
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.980]   He said, "Truly this day you will be with Me in paradise."
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.440]   Also Luke 23:43.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.040]   And then the third thing He said in the opening three hours was to Mary and to John.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.620]   He said, "Woman, behold your son.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.120]   Son behold your mother."
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.280]   And He was giving His mother into the care of the apostle John, as recorded in John 19:26
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.260]   and 27.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:13.620]   So the only thing that broke the silence in the first three hours were those three statements.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:23.000]   Each of them is a statement of grace, grace to offer forgiveness for His executors.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.720]   Grace offered to a thief to bring him to heaven, and grace offered to His mother and
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.000]   His disciple John.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.920]   Only words of grace broke the silence.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:48.740]   Then comes the second three hours, and it begins at noon when essentially the sun is
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.960]   at its zenith, and it is a shock.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.760]   Because that second three hours begins with darkness falling on the land.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.580]   The word "ge" in the Greek could mean the earth.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.640]   It could mean simply darkness covered the planet.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:17.540]   It was already dark on half the planet; perhaps darkness covered the rest as well.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.780]   What was God saying by the darkness?
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.920]   Darkness in the Scripture is darkness.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.600]   It is a symbol of judgment.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.900]   It is a symbol of judgment.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:36.600]   God is saying by the darkness that the cross is a place of divine judgment.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:44.720]   And that divine judgment is falling on that very person hanging on that cross.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:52.880]   And to make it very simple, God only judges one thing, and that is sin.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:02.240]   So this is divine wrath unleashed against sin.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:09.820]   And what makes this so unique is the one hanging on the cross is sinless.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:16.560]   But God has imputed the sins of His people through all of redemptive history to His Son.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.360]   1 Corinthians 15:3, "Christ died for our sins."
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.260]   He was made sin for us, as I quoted earlier.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:33.500]   1 John 4:10, "The Son was sent to be the atonement for our sins."
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:43.660]   So what you have in the darkness is essentially a massive expression of divine wrath and fury
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:52.320]   as God pours out the same kind of wrath promised in the day of the Lord.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.140]   Only He pours it out on His Son.
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:02.520]   The moon goes dark, the sun goes dark, the stars are put out.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.260]   So the first commentary by God on the cross is supernatural darkness.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:17.220]   And what it tells us is the Lord Jesus is being punished by God in a massive way for
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.180]   sin.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.280]   And because He had no sin, He was punished.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   He was punished.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.880]   He had to be punished for someone else's sin.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:37.180]   The second thing that is an amazing commentary by God is in verse 46.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.000]   About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.220]   - that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.460]   This is another act by God.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.240]   First He makes the earth dark.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:04.680]   Second, He separates Himself from the Son of God.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.160]   This happens in the ninth hour, right at the end of the darkness.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.260]   As the darkness ended, so did the life of our Lord.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.440]   The fury of God is almost spent.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   But the horror of the experience was not the same.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:29.700]   It was not just the wrath of God, it was the absence of God.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.540]   And Jesus cries with a loud voice.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.540]   Actually the word means He screamed.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:42.520]   Six hours of agony, three of those hours in the darkness as He was bearing the fury of
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.440]   God against all the sins of all who would ever believe through human history.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.160]   But as the sin-bearing judgment comes to its conclusion, He gathers all His people, and
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.340]   He gives all His strength, and screams the deepest agony of His holy heart, "My God,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.120]   My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:09.380]   And He quotes in saying that Psalm 22:1, Messianic Psalm.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:19.280]   The cry reveals the separation from the Father that He was experiencing.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.120]   He was not separated from the nature of the Father.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:31.620]   But He was separated from fellowship with the Father.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:40.940]   When He said that, the mockery that had already been going on at Calvary reached a new level.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:46.840]   Verse 47: "Some of those who were standing there when they heard it began saying, 'This
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.080]   man is calling for Elijah.'"
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Look, they knew Psalm 22.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.400]   They knew the Messianic promise, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.440]   This is just malicious sarcasm.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.580]   The people knew that the Old Testament promised Elijah also was to come before Messiah, according
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.040]   to Malachi 4.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   So they mock Him on the notion of the joke that He thinks He's the Messiah.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:31.960]   And at this point, Jesus says, "I thirst."
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.700]   That fulfills Psalm 69:21.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.540]   In response to that cry, verse 48 says, "One of them ran, took a sponge, filled it with
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.960]   sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.000]   He gave a drink of cheap wine, probably the kind the soldiers had.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.600]   But the rest of them said, "Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.200]   This is sarcasm.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   This is mockery.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.160]   This is scorn.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:13.060]   And here you have the second profound, divine commentary by God on the death of His Son.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.740]   And it is this: God must separate Himself.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.960]   He must forsake Jesus.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:31.320]   Because God is holy, and Jesus is carrying all the sins of His people to the cross.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.140]   This is what hell is.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:40.700]   Just as hell is the separation of the sinner from God, Jesus is experiencing hell, bearing
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:51.920]   our sins, separated from God, fellowship broken.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.500]   He is the one who is bearing our sins.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   He is the one who was a victim of our sins.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   He is the one who is not a victim of our sins.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   He is the one who is not a victim of our sins.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   He is the one who is a victim of our sins.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   He is the one who is not a victim of our sins.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   He is the one who is a victim of our sins.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   The point of the separation is to prove that Jesus was bearing sin.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:16.180]   God would never have separated from Him if He hadn't borne our guilt.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.880]   Separation proves that our sins were placed on Him.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.840]   Even as He bears the curse for His people, He longs for it to end, and fellowship to
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.880]   be restored to the Father.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.600]   So by the supernatural darkness, God tells us - this is judgment - and by the separation,
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:50.400]   He tells us that Christ is actually bearing sins and is being punished.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.840]   Then there's a third commentary.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.660]   "He has been taken away from God," in verse 50.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:02.900]   And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His Spirit.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:09.920]   The darkness is dispelled, and light begins to be restored, and Jesus screams out again.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.020]   "Krodza" is the word.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:19.640]   He screams with a loud voice, still strong, still strong.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.800]   People lingered on crosses for days before Jesus.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:30.340]   Before they were basically asphyxiated by the inability to push themselves up and breathe.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.880]   Jesus still has plenty of air, air enough to scream with a loud voice.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.260]   He was not going to slowly die like other victims.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.340]   He was not going to die by exhaustion or blood loss or asphyxiation.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.440]   And what did He cry?
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.780]   "It is finished!"
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.760]   He cried with a loud voice.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.380]   "It is finished!"
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.380]   From John 19.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:07.060]   And then said, "Father, into Your hands I commend my spirit," and yielded up His breath.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.720]   He dismisses His own spirit.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:18.660]   He sent His own life away into the presence of God by His own will.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.720]   John 10:18, "No one takes My life from Me.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.100]   I lay it down by Myself."
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.960]   Such a quick death.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.320]   Mark 15 says Pilate was shocked.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.720]   People didn't die that soon.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.940]   And particularly someone like Jesus, who would have been the epitome of what manhood would
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:51.680]   be: sinless, therefore strong physically in a way we wouldn't even be able to comprehend.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:19:01.040]   The divine miracle here is that the cross didn't kill Him, the Romans didn't kill Him,
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.320]   the Jews didn't kill Him.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.120]   He willingly gave up His life.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:19.680]   So what you have at the cross is divine judgment on sin, and you have sacrifice that is willing.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   He bore our judgment.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   He took our guilt.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.520]   He died willingly out of love for us.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:37.780]   There's a fourth commentary: "And behold" - verse 51 - "the veil of the temple was torn
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.640]   in two from top to bottom.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.380]   In the darkness you see judgment.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:51.300]   In the separation you see sin and guilt; in the willingness to give up His own life and
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.680]   yield to the will of God.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:20:05.920]   In the
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   wilderness you see the Lord's love and His own sacrifice."
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920]   And here, in verse 51, you see satisfaction.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   "Was God satisfied?" is the question, with the sacrifice of Christ.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.540]   Did He accomplish what the Father wanted Him to accomplish?
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:21.680]   Did He successfully accomplish a substitutionary death in which He took on our guilt?
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.980]   And God judged Him for our sins.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   Did He do it?
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.260]   Verse 51 is the answer: "The veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom."
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:42.700]   Thirty feet wide and thirty feet high, four inches thick.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:51.680]   And Josephus says, "Horses pulling against each other couldn't tear that curtain."
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.500]   That curtain barred people from God, right?
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.140]   Who could go behind the curtain?
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.680]   The Holy of Holies, only the high priest once a year.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.120]   And before he went in there, he had to make sure that he offered a sacrifice for his own
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.220]   sins.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.660]   The way to God was barred.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.680]   But when Christ died, God ripped the curtain.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.780]   Top to bottom, to show it wasn't done by any human being.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:35.680]   God ripped it from top to bottom because Christ's death satisfied God's requirement and opened
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.260]   the way into His eternal presence for all who come through Christ.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:51.680]   And there's no more Holy of Holies, and there's no more barrier, and there are no more sacrifices,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.600]   no more priesthood.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:02.120]   Imagine this happens at three o'clock on Passover in a crowded temple.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:10.040]   The curtain rips from top to bottom, and the Holy of Holies is exposed, the very symbol
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.980]   of the abode of God.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:19.320]   No more temple, no more holy place, no more Holy of Holies, no more sacrifice, no more
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.480]   priesthood.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.680]   Why?
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:31.620]   Because the way to God was thrown wide open by the sacrifice of Christ, and that robber's
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:38.260]   den and that temple would soon be reduced to rubble.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:51.680]   And that is why the writer of Hebrews in chapter 10, verse 19 says - and these are welcoming
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.120]   words - "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:06.640]   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He inaugurated for us through the veil that
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.220]   is His flesh, and since we have a great high priest over the house of God - " listen to
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.580]   this - " - let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and full assurance of faith,
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.680]   having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience, our body washed with pure
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   blood, and our hearts filled with the blood of Jesus Christ, we will be cleansed by the
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   blood of Jesus Christ."
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.460]   And so the writer says, "If we have been cleansed, not by a laver or some kind of animal
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:33.680]   sacrifice, but if we have been cleansed by Christ, we can walk right into the presence
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.240]   of God."
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   God then at the cross, by ripping the curtain, declares that Jesus has provided full access
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.680]   into His presence.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:24:05.180]   And there's a fifth part of this scene that gives divine commentary on the event.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:15.920]   Verse 51: "The earth shook, the rocks were split, the tombs were opened, and many bodies
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.680]   of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.340]   they entered the holy city and appeared to many."
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   Final astonishing divine act at the cross.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:47.680]   The final interpretation of the death of Christ by God is that it made possible our - what?
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   - resurrection.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:25:00.660]   The final bodily resurrection came through the cross, and God gave a preview of it by
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:07.360]   raising the dead who didn't show up publicly until Christ was raised because He was to
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.660]   be the firstfruits.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.180]   I'm glad we have Isaiah.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.880]   I'm glad we have Paul.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.220]   I'm glad we have Peter and John to explain the cross.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.400]   God explained the cross while it was happening.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.680]   The wrath of God against sin.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.060]   Sin is seen in the darkness.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.860]   The holiness of God in turning away from sinners is seen in the separation.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:36.260]   The love of God is seen in the self-sacrificial death of God incarnate.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:45.180]   The satisfaction of God is seen in that the Holy of Holies is thrown wide open, and no
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:51.680]   priest is ever needed again.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:00.280]   The hope of eternal resurrection is seen in the sudden raising of the saints.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.620]   This is God's commentary on the cross.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:10.580]   What an incredible scene it was.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.580]   Let's bow in prayer.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:21.680]   Father, we are again amazed and stunned by the wonder of Your divine revelation.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.980]   We are so enriched by these realities.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:35.080]   Your Word literally overwhelms us with its truth and its power.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.640]   If there's anything in our lives that dishonors You, Lord, take it out.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.400]   Forgive it and remove it.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:51.680]   That's our prayer as we share in this table.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   We are so blessed to have You in our lives.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   We are so blessed to have You in our lives.
