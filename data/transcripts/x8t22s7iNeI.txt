[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520]   - We dip into the Ask Pastor John podcast inbox today.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.280]   Pastor John, my name is Jake from Mexico.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.800]   What does 1 John 5.18 mean?
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.480]   That's the end of the question from Jake
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040]   and I'll go ahead and read the text from the ESV.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.360]   It says, "We know that everyone who has been born of God
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.300]   "does not keep on sinning,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.060]   "but he who was born of God protects him
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.680]   "and the evil one does not touch him."
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.580]   Pastor John, what does this text, 1 John 5.18 mean?
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.980]   - I'm not sure what part of this verse
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920]   Jake is stumbling over.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.100]   There are three he could stumble over.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.100]   One would be those born of God do not keep on sinning.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.560]   Another one would be he who is born of God protects them.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.680]   What does that mean?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.080]   Or a third would be the evil one does not touch him.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.460]   Whoa, really?
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.300]   What does that mean?
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.300]   I'm not sure which of those three he's stumbling over,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.300]   so maybe I better say a word about each one.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.080]   What I'm thinking is maybe Jake is reading
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.260]   the King James Authorized Version
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.840]   or the New American Standard Version of that first clause
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.120]   because it is even more perplexing.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   It says, "We know that whosoever is born of God
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.920]   "sinneth not."
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.060]   That's the King James or the New American Standard says,
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.900]   "We know that no one who is born of God sins."
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920]   So I would join Jake if I read those and say,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   "Huh, really Christians don't sin?"
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.220]   Now that sounds truly problematical.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160]   Christians never sin.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.240]   I met a woman one time who believed that.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.800]   And she threw this verse in chapter three, verse nine at me.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   And I said, "Well, what do you call the bad things you do?"
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.200]   And she had invented a lot of names for her sins.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.060]   Like she called them mistakes and flaws
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.160]   and shortcomings and imperfections, but she was adamant.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.060]   I don't sin.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.120]   Now, the ESV is right to translate
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.760]   "We know that everyone who has been born of God,"
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.840]   and then it translates, "does not keep on sinning,"
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.120]   which helps a little bit maybe.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.260]   Chapter three, verse nine, same issue.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.820]   "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning,
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.680]   "for God's seed abides in him,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.460]   "and he cannot keep on sinning
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.240]   "because he's been born of God."
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.760]   Now, I could pull rank with Greek here, which I will,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.080]   and then I'll back up and say,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   "Don't, that's not the key issue."
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   The idea of the Greek present tense
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.640]   is that those who are born again
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.760]   and have the Spirit of God in them
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   cannot ever make peace with sin, settle in with sin,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.960]   make sin a friend, be okay with sinning,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   just go on with sinning as though
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.700]   no war needs to be made against it
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.680]   and nothing will come of it if we do.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.360]   The present tense says, "No, you can't do that.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.420]   "You can't make a practice of sinning like that."
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.600]   But if you don't know Greek,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.280]   you don't have to trust me at this point
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.540]   because there are a couple of other reasons
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.240]   why non-Greek readers know
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.440]   that this text does not mean
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.560]   Christians don't ever do anything wrong.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   Verse 16, what's that, two verses earlier in chapter five?
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.520]   "If anyone sees his brother,"
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.200]   okay, what's a brother, a Christian?
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.120]   "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin,
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.160]   "not leading to death, he shall ask God
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.080]   "and God will give him life."
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.900]   So he can't mean, he cannot mean that Christians don't sin
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.400]   'cause he just gave instructions
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.160]   for how to help Christians who do sin.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.320]   Same thing in chapter one, verses eight and nine.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520]   "and the truth is not in us.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.260]   "If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.600]   "to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.960]   "from all unrighteousness."
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.240]   If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.560]   and his word is not in us.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.960]   So the meaning of 1 John 5:18,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.680]   "No one who is born of God sins,"
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   is that, and you get two possible things
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.640]   and both are probably the case.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.920]   If you just go with the context where he said,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.300]   "There is sin that is unto death
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.660]   "and there's sin that is not unto death.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.460]   "Pray for the sin that is not unto death
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.120]   "and God will deliver and the sin that is unto death
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.720]   "is gonna lead to destruction."
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.880]   So I think here in the context,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.280]   the first and obvious meaning would be,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.380]   does not sin unto death.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.380]   The one who is born of God does not sin unto death.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.640]   That is, we don't make peace with sin.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   Settle into a pattern of sinning
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   that will destroy us in the end.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   Prove that we are not truly born of God
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   and are not truly Christians.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.460]   Christians walk in the light.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.840]   And according to chapter one, verse seven and eight,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.200]   walking in the light is not sinlessness.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.520]   It is walking in a way that you have eyes to see
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.040]   in the light, the ugliness of what you just did
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.620]   and you are sorry for it.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.240]   You confess it, you keep short accounts with God
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.300]   and you move on.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.240]   So I think does not sin means doesn't commit the sin
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.800]   unto death and doesn't settle into a pattern of sinning
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.000]   that proves you have no spiritual life in you.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Second issue, he who is born of God protects him.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.540]   I think that means that Christ,
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.680]   who is called the one born of God,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   the only begotten of God, the eternally virgin born spirit,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.200]   born by the spirit son of God,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.680]   Christ guards us from the devil.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.920]   He intercedes for us.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.720]   And he is with us to the end of the age, helping us.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.480]   And his blood covers us and keeps us safe
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.680]   from Satan's accusations 'cause none of them can hold
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.840]   because Christ has died for us.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.880]   And then lastly, the evil one does not touch him.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   Means the devil's accusations and temptations
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.240]   and harassments may indeed give us great trouble
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.520]   but they can never destroy us.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.760]   There's no deadly touch.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.000]   There's no poisonous touch.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.280]   His fangs were removed at the cross
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.280]   and his lethal poison is taken away from believers.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.160]   He cannot destroy us.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.480]   So I take cannot touch us to mean
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.600]   can't touch us with any deadly touch.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.560]   He can hurt us terribly.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.320]   I don't wanna minimize Satan's reality in this world.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.120]   He can hurt us terribly.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   He can throw us in prison and he can move others to kill us
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.720]   according to Revelation 2.10,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.640]   but he can't hurt us ultimately.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.200]   He can't touch us with the touch
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   of destruction and damnation.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.400]   That's been taken out of his hand by the blood of Jesus.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.280]   Jesus did that when he died on the cross
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.680]   according to Colossians 2.15.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.600]   He disarmed the principalities and powers
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   when he died and shed his blood.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   So the only begotten of God is indeed our perfect
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.000]   and everlasting protector.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.800]   - That is glorious truth, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.600]   And if you have a concise and specific question
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.400]   for John Piper like Jake did,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.920]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.880]   and look for the button that says submit a question.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.480]   You can also easily send us questions
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.080]   through our mobile apps as well.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.120]   If you get familiar with the features there,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   you can one-click send us a question.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.520]   We're back tomorrow to talk about
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.320]   why the practice of consistent spiritual discipline
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.600]   is not legalism.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.440]   And we'll take a life lesson from the life of Daniel
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.680]   in the Old Testament.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, I'll see you then.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.840]   (upbeat music)
