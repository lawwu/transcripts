[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   We have two tubes that are right next to each other in the throat.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.240]   One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot, whatever you're going to swallow.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   All of that stuff must go down the esophagus, the food tube, and end up in
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.160]   the stomach. And right next to the esophagus,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.920]   millimeters away, is the windpipe or the trachea, which goes
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.560]   down to the lungs. Throat, heart, feces, genitals. Every organ
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880]   from moment to moment keeps us alive and ensures our survival. The genitals are
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.120]   in a way the opposite. How would you improve the penis and the vagina?
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.280]   The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman, a physician
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.600]   and writer of The Unseen Body, a doctor's journey through the
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.760]   hidden wonders of human anatomy. He has practiced medicine
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.720]   in some of the world's most remote places, including
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.800]   the Alaskan and Russian Arctic, Antarctica,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To

[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.600]   description. And now, dear friends, here's Jonathan Reisman.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   You wrote a book called Unseen Body, all about the human body, the messy, the
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.720]   weird, the beautiful, and the fascinating details. So, from an
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.840]   evolutionary perspective, are most parts of the human body a
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.640]   feature or a bug? Is it like the optimal solution or just a
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   duct tape solution? Great question. I think that most of the
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.280]   time, the way the body works is the best solution. I haven't seen many
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.440]   alternatives, so it's hard to compare. But I think, you know, there's some
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.520]   parts of the body that make more sense than others. You know, the way our hands
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.720]   work, for instance. You know, the muscles are up in the
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.360]   forearm and then the tendons kind of come down like
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.960]   strings on a puppet. And just the dexterity it gives our hands is just
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   really amazing, and it's hard to imagine a
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.600]   better tool than the human hand to do everything from, you know, hold
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.280]   things to play piano and do a million other daily
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.960]   activities that we do. One thing I talk about in the book,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking that kind of brilliant
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   design, such as the throat, you know, where the
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.560]   food, drink are swallowed and air is inhaled, and they
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.680]   kind of, those two paths come within millimeters of each other.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.280]   And you slip up once, you laugh while eating, or you
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.040]   speak while trying to swallow, and you die from choking. So it
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400]   seems less than optimal, though I'm not sure it could be better from
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.600]   the way we're kind of formed in the womb, as a
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.280]   beginning as this tiny little tube. I don't think it could have been done any
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.040]   better or there's any other way to do it, but it is an unfortunate thing that,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.480]   you know, does lead to some problems. So the hand, if I could just
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.440]   linger on that for a second, you talk about the wisdom of a design
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.680]   in the book. What are the important things about the hand? It seems like very
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.280]   useful for many things, and it seems to be quite effective.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960]   A lot of people think the thumb is foundational
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.040]   to human civilization. Is there any truth to that?
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.240]   I think that is true. Actually, one of the ways in which the importance of
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.080]   individual fingers comes to attention is when people have
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.120]   severe injuries to their fingers. For instance,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   I have a story in the book about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.640]   by his dog's leash. And, you know, when plastic surgeons, who are often the
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.600]   ones to repair that--sometimes it's orthopedic surgeons--
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.320]   they will debate, you know, how important is it to save this finger, or how
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.240]   important is it to save, you know, let's say the kind of tip,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.920]   the one-third, the tip one-third of one of your fingers. You know, it depends on
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.640]   the length that you'll lose, it depends on which finger.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so the thumb really is the most crucial,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.360]   just, you know, for your occupation in most cases to
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.200]   just daily life and your ability to get around, take care of yourself and others.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.680]   So, you know, they'll be more--they're
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.280]   willing to go further, do more surgeries, more aggressive therapy
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.760]   to save a thumb, let's say, than, you know, the tip of your pinky finger. So in that
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.160]   way, I do think the thumb, you know, does seem
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.600]   like the most important in many ways. It's nice that there's backups. I wonder
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.880]   if that's part of the feature, or is it just the symmetry that nature
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.960]   produces? You think the two hands is like--is it
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.560]   about the symmetry, or is it about backup? We'd be much less
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.840]   formidable hunters, gatherers, survivors in any way
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.800]   if we only had one hand. So I think that is important to have two, so we can,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.560]   you know, even everything from kind of spearing an animal, to firing a bow and
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.160]   arrow, to butchering an animal, you really need two hands to do it very effectively.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.520]   But can you do a better job with three? Great question, and we'll never know,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.960]   perhaps. You tweeted--now I'm gonna analyze your
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.080]   tweets, like it's Shakespeare sometimes. You tweeted that, quote, "Millions of years
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.520]   of sex and death design the human body." It's like poetry.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.200]   Are those two basic activities basically summarize everything that
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.400]   resulted in humans on earth? So is that a good summary of
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   the evolutionary process that led to this conscious, intelligent being?
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   Is death and sex? In a way, yeah. So sex is how more of us get made,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   obviously, and death is how we get weeded out, or the gene pool gets
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.640]   weeded out, and certain genes survive and others don't. And
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.120]   you know, the age at which we die, whether it's before we've,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   you know, had sex and reproduced ourselves, is a big factor in who
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   survives, who doesn't, who passes on their genes, and what the future
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.320]   of the body looks like. You know, who lived and who died
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.920]   before they were able to be at reproductive age a million years ago
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.160]   was pretty important in what we look like now, and perhaps
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.080]   how we have sex and die now will determine what we're shaped like,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   unless technology has an even bigger role in that, you know, a million years
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.680]   from now. So you think that's fundamental to, like, if there's
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.760]   alien civilizations out there that have the same order of magnitude of
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   intelligence or greater, do you think that we will see something
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.040]   like sex and something like death? So the reproducing and this
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.120]   selection process, plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.200]   Is that kind of foundational to life? I would think so. I mean, it sure seems to
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.800]   be on Earth, you know, perhaps in some distant future when
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.400]   medicine is nearing, you know, perfection and people can live a really long time,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   maybe we won't even need to reproduce as much,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   or something like that, you know, it's hard to even know what
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   life will be like in the distant future, but I would guess that any alien
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.560]   civilization will have the same dependence on
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.160]   who has sex and who dies. Well, that's the problem with immortality, how are we
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.840]   going to clear out the old to make room for the new, which is
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.400]   kind of a framework of adaptability to changing environments.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   So as long as the environment is changing, and it seems to always be,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.800]   because this the entirety of the Earth system is a complex system,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.560]   it seems like you have to adapt, and to adapt you have to kill off the stubborn
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.400]   old ideas, and unless there's a way to like not
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.280]   become stubborn and old, but it feels like the nature of wisdom
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.640]   is stubborn and old, like that's what wisdom is, it's like the
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.200]   lessons of life, the lessons of experience solidified,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.120]   and the solidification is the thing that actually prevents you
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   from reinventing yourself to adapt to the new
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.160]   changing conditions. But then again, why not have that both those modes, like have
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.240]   two minds in one person, one immortal person that like in the
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.720]   morning they act like a teenager, in the evening they act like an old wise
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.320]   man, that's possible. So you see you can imagine
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.800]   within one mind both modes, but those are required, you have to
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.880]   have the ability to completely reinvent
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.480]   yourself, which is what death does in an ugly way,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.520]   or a beautiful way, depending on your perspective, depending whether you take
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.360]   the human perspective or the human, the nature's perspective, and then you
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.400]   have to have the selection, so competition, so sexual selection.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.800]   It's an interesting little planet we got. What's the weirdest part,
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.680]   function, concept, idea about the human body to you? We'll talk about
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.360]   fascinating details, but what's, you, I should say for people that should
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.680]   read your book, they will come face to face with the fact that you do not shy
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.640]   away from the weird and the wonderful of the
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.480]   human body. It's like, it's fun, but it's honest.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.600]   So given that, sorry to make you pick one of your children, but
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.040]   what's the weirdest one, would you say? The weirdest body part.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.560]   Or concept, or function. So the chapters you divide up kind of
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   into parts, but there could be a thread that
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.120]   connects all of them, the weirdness, maybe, or maybe the the texture of the
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.880]   substance, could be the liquids, the solids, I don't know.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.240]   Definitely every body part and bodily fluid has their own
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.520]   kind of both gross and fascinating aspects. That's
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.040]   probably why I'm a generalist as a doctor and couldn't just,
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.480]   as you said, pick one of my children, become a specialist, because I like them
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.320]   all. I feel like one of the strangest
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.440]   concepts about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it that are the
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.880]   most universal, that we all do, are the most taboo
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.080]   socially. I wouldn't have expected that if I had,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.440]   you know, just looked from the outside. Like what we do in the bathroom, what we
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.080]   do in the bedroom, what we do to our own genitals, what we do
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.800]   to our, you know, quote-unquote private parts,
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.320]   they're private, even though it's sort of the thing that we have all have in
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.120]   common, is the most we try to hide from other
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.360]   people and don't talk about in polite company.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   I mean, it makes sense as a human living in the society, but from the outside it
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.440]   sort of might be surprising. -How do you make sense of that if you put
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.360]   on your Sigmund Freud hat? The thing we all do, why do we make that
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   a taboo thing? Is it because we like taboos?
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.120]   Maybe we get off, or maybe our kinks as humans is to have taboos,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.560]   and it's kind of efficient to have taboos about the things that everybody
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.400]   does. Like you could make walking taboo or
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.480]   something, I don't know. But just maybe that's what we love, that's
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.280]   what's exciting to us, is the forbidden. -I think, yes, society
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.440]   loves rules for sure. They love some societies more than
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.120]   others, you know. They love controlling how you think and what you do
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.640]   in public versus in private. You know, there's a lot of societies where,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.160]   for instance, parents have sex in front of children.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.080]   For instance, in a traditional Inupiat Eskimo
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.680]   society, that was sort of normal. But what are you going to do, go
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.720]   outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic and do it out there? Of
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.600]   course not. So there's different
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.200]   taboos in different societies. Some taboos make perfect sense.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.280]   Some taboos are even public health measures, you know. Like
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.200]   as I talk in the book about in India where
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.040]   the hands are symmetric, as you said, but in Indian culture
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.400]   the left hand is taboo and the right hand is what you use for
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.720]   shaking hands, for eating, for other things. And the left hand is
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.920]   the dirty hand that you use for wiping your own bottom, you know, that's the
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.000]   toilet paper is your left hand. So while the body is anatomically
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.800]   symmetric, the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry. But for a good
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.760]   reason, you know, you probably shouldn't be shaking hands with other people
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   with the same hand that you use to kind of clean your bottom. So in that sense,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.200]   it makes sense. Yeah, maybe the roots of it make sense,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.520]   but the way it propagates, especially as the times change, might not
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.880]   because you can wash your hands. But the
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   taboo remains. Right, society is very slow to change.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.760]   What is the most fascinating part, function, or concept in the human body?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.240]   So, you know, something that fills you with awe.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.400]   I guess the most obvious one is the brain, partly because it's so,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.760]   you know, sort of poorly understood, though we
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.880]   understand more than we ever have in the past. There's still so much that we don't
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.480]   understand about how the lump of matter in our skulls
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.280]   kind of creates this subjective experience that we all
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.160]   kind of understand quite viscerally. That's an easy one. I would say the
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   kidneys are an underappreciated organ. The way they tinker with the
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.560]   bloodstream, raise levels of this, lower levels of
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.920]   that, kind of our entire lives from inside the womb until we die is just
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.640]   really incredible. And when you look at how much
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.160]   energy different organs consume, the brain and the kidneys are
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.480]   two of the biggest ones, because the brain obviously in us is always active
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.600]   and controlling parts of the body, but the kidneys are just
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.120]   consuming a ton of energy to do what they do. They're kind of the unsung hero
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.160]   of the body, relegated to the back of the abdomen, like
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.120]   some forgotten organ, but they are great. I did consider being a
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.000]   nephrologist, which is a kidney specialist, because I was so
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.280]   taken with the kidneys, but, you know, decided I like all the organs, so
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.840]   couldn't pick just one. So your book is ordered in a particular
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.080]   way. It's throat, heart, feces, genitals,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.000]   liver, pineal gland, brain, skin, urine,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.120]   fat, lungs, eyes, mucus, fingers and toes, and blood.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.760]   All right. First of all, great, great chapter titles. Is there a reason
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   for this ordering, or is it all madness? There's a few different reasons that
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.880]   went into it. I did want to start with the throat for
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:19.200]   the reason that it kind of presents the topic of death, which is sort of
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.560]   obviously very important in the training of a physician, in the career of a
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.200]   physician. It's a big part of what I deal with.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.440]   You know, on the first day of medical school, we started the dissection of a
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.240]   cadaver in the class called anatomy lab, and so
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.520]   in a way, we were kind of thrown right in there in the beginning,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.720]   like, this is the end of the human story, you know,
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.360]   understand this, and then we sort of backed up to the beginning with
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.600]   embryology and reproduction and stuff. So it's kind of like we got, and I got
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.880]   thrown into that right away, right in the beginning, kind
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.000]   of like, here's a dead body, now start cutting it apart and learn the
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.800]   name and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.320]   How did that change you, that first experience with the cold honesty of
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.960]   human biology? Right, that's exactly what it was, this
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.120]   cold honesty about the kind of the story of each individual human body. It has an
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.960]   end, and that's it. I think that, well,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.400]   actually before the end of that first day, so what we did on that first day was
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.240]   study the superficial muscles of the back, like the lats or latissimus dorsi
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.360]   and some other muscles, you know, we cut through the skin of the back, my
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.840]   cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.440]   we pulled back the kind of plastic sheets that would keep him moist for the
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.040]   next four months as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back, and
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.000]   then started dissecting through the superficial muscles of the back,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.440]   and that was really all we saw that first day. We didn't get any deeper,
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.760]   didn't enter the abdominal or chest cavity to see internal organs, but
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.400]   I was so fascinated with this sort of behind-the-scenes look at how
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.240]   things work in the body, how you move your arms, how you arch your back,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   you know, these are the muscles that do it, that I decided I wanted to donate my
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.160]   own body for the same purpose. So I made that decision literally before
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.800]   the end of that first day of class, and I'm still sticking to it.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.320]   So someday there will be a medical student that can
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.360]   watch and listen to this podcast while dissecting your body.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.560]   It could happen. They might not know that that person they're listening to on the
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.120]   podcast will be the carcass in front of them,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.000]   but we never learned anything. The universe will know.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.640]   The universe will know. And they will acknowledge the irony or the humor,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.880]   the absurdity of that. The universe will chuckle, but the medical student won't
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.080]   know because they never, as I did not, learn
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   any personal information about the person,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.400]   only what I could glean from looking inside him, which actually tells you
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.760]   quite a bit. I knew he was a smoker, I knew he had coronary artery disease,
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   you know, you get a window into--I knew he was overweight--you
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.080]   get a window into people's lives just by looking in their
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.520]   bodies after death. Other
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.920]   cadavers in the lab, not my own, or I shared one with three other students, but
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.200]   other cadavers, some had, you know, metal joints like a knee
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.000]   replacement, some had a kidney missing, so
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.440]   they probably--and we could tell it was surgically removed, not that he was born
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.240]   with one, and we could tell that he probably had a
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.400]   kidney tumor or cancer that was removed. So
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.680]   you do get an insight into people's lives from,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.560]   you know, picking them apart after they're dead, but you don't know their
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:23.680]   name or what podcast they've been on. So as the book title says, "Unseen Body,"
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   so it tells some kind of story of your life.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.320]   So it does capture the decisions you've made in your life, the things you've done
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.400]   that might be kind of secret to that person and maybe to a few
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   others that knew him or her well. It's so fascinating. So
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.000]   what kind of things can it reveal? Like, what kind of choices in terms of
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.800]   the injuries, the catastrophic events, the
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.960]   lifestyle choices of smoking and diet and all those kinds of things, what
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.080]   can you see? What kind of history can you see about the human
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.760]   before you? So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.360]   You can, you know, take the skin for example, right? Most things that happen to
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.800]   us leave a mark, you know, as I say, a kind
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.280]   of a story written in the language of scar,
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.960]   where it tells you injuries you've had. And same thing with animals, you know, I've
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.320]   seen deer hides that have marks that look like they're made by
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.600]   maybe a barbed wire fence, something like that. You can tell,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.280]   you know, sometimes it's conjecture, but you can sort of imagine what might
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.520]   have happened to cause that. Perhaps, you know,
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.640]   two bucks were fighting and one got injured with an antler.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.560]   And the same with humans, you know, I have scars on my body and when I
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.800]   notice them I remember what happened. You know, I got a big cut on my hand when I
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.640]   was 13 and it's still there and I remember what
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.280]   happened, you know, every time I look at it. And so in that way,
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.800]   only I might know that story, but other people, you know, when they dissect me and
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   notice the same scars, they can kind of, it can fire their imagination as my
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.920]   cadaver, you know, did for me. They know that there is a story
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.960]   there. That's such an interesting way that the skin does tell a story,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.400]   both tattoos and scars. Right. Some of the fun you've had and some
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.240]   of the damage you've done. Right. And even when I evaluate a
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.840]   patient, I can use scars to help me make medical
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.960]   decisions. So for instance, someone that comes in with abdominal pain into the
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.080]   emergency room, you can see scars on their abdomen that
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.680]   tell you about, you know, the past kind of activities of a surgeon,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.960]   perhaps. I know, I recognize the scars that are
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.160]   left when someone has their gallbladder removed, the scars when someone has their
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.800]   appendix removed, when maybe when someone's had a hysterectomy,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.320]   and that can tell you what it might be or what it isn't. You
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.800]   know, if someone doesn't have an appendix, their abdominal pain is not
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   appendicitis, end of story. So in that way, I'm sort of looking at
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.920]   these, the tracks or the footprints of past
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.360]   surgeries to tell me what might and might not be the cause of this
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.600]   patient's abdominal pain, which is kind of my main job
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   in the ER is figuring out what's causing it and to help them.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.040]   Is there ways to get more data about the human body as we look into the future
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.200]   of medicine, biology, that would be helpful to fill in some of the gaps of
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.320]   the story? So, you know, you have
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.400]   companies, you have research that looks at, you know, a collection of blood over
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.800]   long periods of time to see, sort of, you know, paint a picture of what's
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.840]   happening in your body, mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.760]   but also just, you know, to anticipate things that can go
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.120]   wrong and all that kind of stuff. Is there, can you just speak to a greater
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.560]   digital world that we're stepping in, how that can help
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.520]   tell a richer story? I certainly think that we
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.600]   have more data than we know what to do with right now, especially with
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.760]   kind of direct-to-consumer medical devices, you know, smart watches, etc.,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.040]   that are just collecting these reams of data. I have
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.560]   not seen them put to, I think, the eventual use that
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.120]   they will. I think that the potential is, sort of,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.320]   just, you know, unimaginable, and I hope we're
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.440]   heading into a new age where, you know, you can determine,
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.200]   for instance, is a person going to have more of the dangerous side effects to a
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.360]   drug based on their genetics, or are they going to tolerate one drug
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.200]   better than the other, you know, based on their genetics? And
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.480]   we are slowly moving into that age, and especially
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.600]   the age of kind of completely synthesizing drugs
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.120]   in a lab, you know, much like, for instance, some of the COVID
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.040]   vaccines, actually, like Moderna never had a virus in their lab.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.320]   They made that vaccine completely without ever having the virus themselves, just by
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.680]   having the genome, which is sort of astounding, and there's a lot of
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.040]   potential going forward, you know, based on that technology and some others.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.000]   I didn't know that. So they, basically, it's all in the computer. It's
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.760]   computational. Right, you have the genetic code, you have tremendous power, even if
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.680]   you don't have the organism itself. What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes and
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   efforts like that? First of all, I am a
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.480]   curious, I'm drawn to the darkness in human nature, because
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   that somehow reveals the full spectrum of what humans
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.120]   could be. So there's a lot of sort of controversial
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.800]   thoughts about who she is and her efforts and so on. I
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.160]   think you may have even tweeted about it, but I've read a lot of your tweets, so
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.840]   I'm now forgetting. But what do you make of her and those,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.600]   both those efforts and the charlatans that
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.040]   sort of snake oil salesmen that promised those efforts to do more
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.080]   than they currently can? I think that her, you know, that goal
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.920]   that she had, that she created Theranos to try to achieve,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.440]   to use less blood in tests, is a very worthy goal
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   and a huge frontier that we have not achieved, and that I hope
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.120]   we will achieve. So I understand why, you know,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.720]   someone describes what a huge step forward that would be, and it would be
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.520]   indeed. I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   Can you describe what was the promise? What are we even talking about with
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.160]   Theranos, just for people who don't know?
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.000]   So Theranos is a company that was basically started to
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.680]   revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.080]   both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it, you know, if anyone's ever been
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.360]   to the doctor and had five to ten tubes of blood removed from
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.120]   them, it can be quite surprising how much they take out.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.200]   And it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology, that we
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.160]   need those volumes of blood to run all the tests that we want to. And so the
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.840]   promise of Theranos was that perhaps with a single drop of blood we
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.040]   would be able to know as much about the person's, the
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.800]   condition of their body, without drawing all that blood. And
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.760]   thereby, you know, there would be these devices she was
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.280]   going to create that would sort of do it. You put a drop of blood in and spits out
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.000]   everything you ever wanted to know about what's in your bloodstream, and
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   in a way that would make it so much easier, you know, it could be, you could
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.320]   have one in your home, theoretically, and you, I don't know why you'd wonder what
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.400]   your potassium level is on any given day, but you could check if you wanted to.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.960]   And so that goal is very worthy, you know, I put that goal up there
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.560]   with the frontier of making painkillers that
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.520]   are as good as opioids without the addictive quality, you know, that would be
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.000]   such a huge revolution if we did have that in medicine.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.800]   But, and particularly for me, because I trained in both pediatrics and internal
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.440]   medicine, so I learned to care for both children and
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.280]   adults, in children we do draw much less blood, they have a much lower blood
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   volume, and we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood,
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.960]   and we seemingly get equivalent information out of the larger tubes we
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.680]   draw from adults, and I'm still unclear, to be honest, why
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.240]   we can't draw that little amount of blood from adults.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.600]   It seems technically possible, I don't know what the barriers are, I'm sure
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.840]   there are, or else we'd be doing it, but I do think that that is a very
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.160]   important goal, and if Theranos had done it, they would
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.880]   have really revolutionized the practice of medicine.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.680]   - So to return to that cadaver, that first day
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.520]   when you got to meet with a dead, with a
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.880]   human body that's no longer living, so how quickly
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.040]   did it take for you to get used to sort of, you said, looking at the surface
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.480]   muscles of the back, I mean, that can be overwhelming as a
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.720]   thought, and people listening to this that have never
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.800]   dissected anything might be overwhelmed by that thought, so like,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.640]   how quickly were you able to get used to
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.400]   the brutal honesty of the biology before you?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.480]   - For me, it did not take long at all. I guess I've never been a squeamish
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   person, so for me, it was kind of riveting and fascinating right from the first
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.800]   moment, but I do know some of my fellow classmates did have some
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.720]   trouble with it. Some of them I heard had nightmares in the
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.520]   first few weeks of anatomy lab, but then everyone, as far as I know,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.040]   got used to it, and that was also actually a big lesson
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.240]   for me, that it's pretty amazing what people can get used to in their daily
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.560]   lives, and I kind of extrapolated that to people living through war and through,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.280]   you know, just terrible situations and living under, you know,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.400]   oppressive regimes, and it really is amazing what
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.440]   people can get used to, almost anything. - But you know, in war,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.120]   people often come back and they have nightmares,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   they suffer through it, there's PTSD, there's a lot of complicated
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.600]   feelings with that. Are echoes of those same complicated
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   feelings possible in the case of training to be and
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.200]   becoming a doctor? - It's a good point, yeah. I think, you
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.320]   know, sometimes, just as, you know, a barbed wire fence can
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   leave a scar on your skin, you know, emotional, psychological
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.160]   experiences can leave a mark on your brain or your memory, and I
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.640]   think that that definitely could be,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.200]   could be a problem in medical training. You do see a lot of things that are
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.000]   very shocking, very repulsive, things that you never forget. I know one of those
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.360]   students that had nightmares initially went on to be a surgeon,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.280]   so I imagine she's not having the PTSD of kind of seeing inside her first dead
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.360]   body, because she sees inside them all day,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.880]   every day now, but I'm sure it could. You know, we go on to see so many
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.600]   kind of grosser or more shocking things in medical training through medical
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.680]   school, and then by working with actual living patients, not just dead and
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.080]   embalmed bodies. So I do think that things can leave a
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.880]   mark, but I don't think that initial cadaver
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.560]   would be the most traumatic. - Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.320]   the demons make you a better surgeon, just like
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.040]   some of your own psychological trauma might make you a better psychiatrist.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.480]   Returning to the ordering, is it order or is it chaos, the ordering
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.200]   of the chapters from throat and heart and feces and
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.640]   genitals all the way to fingers and toes and blood?
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   - So I did mention that, you know, throat was the first one, because I kind of
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.960]   wanted to throw the reader right into the brutal
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.400]   honesty of death, and I followed it up with feces as the
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.200]   third chapter, and in a way partly to also throw them right into the deep
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.640]   end of how I like discussing parts of the body
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.720]   and revealing their gross and fascinating aspects. So I didn't want to
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.160]   hide anything. You know, when you train to be a doctor, everything is
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.520]   on the table, literally, in the cadaver lab, but also just,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.680]   you know, you deal with blood and piss and vomit and feces, and that's kind of
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.720]   the medium of your craft. - Yes, the medium of the craft, that's right.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.200]   Like if you're a painter, this is the paint.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.680]   - Exactly. - And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.600]   Like almost like a dance, because there's multiple painters. One of the painters
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.800]   is the biology. So let's return to throat. You mentioned
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.480]   it's a weird one. So first of all, a friend of mine said, "I just see humans
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:23.200]   as a bunch of holes that just walk around."
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.280]   - Not untrue. - It's a funny way to look at humans.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.680]   So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:39.760]   we have the sexual holes, vagina, penis, and then, you know, what's the
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.360]   medical term for your asshole? - Anus. - Anus, thank you.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.040]   - This is a very technical discussion. - The rectums further in, don't confuse the
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.840]   two. - Oh, that's very important. Is there a
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.080]   difference between throat and mouth? By the way, so when you say throat, are
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.720]   we talking about when that hole actually becomes tubular?
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.800]   - The throat I would count as just sort of the very back of the,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.400]   you know, the back of the mouth, where the nose also comes down and meets it,
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.560]   where the tonsils are and the uvula. But you're right that, you know, we are a
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   bunch of holes, but more accurately, we're a tube, right? We start in the womb as
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.880]   kind of this microscopic little disc, almost like a,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.280]   you know, a flatbread, and then we roll in almost like a burrito into this
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.680]   tube. And we're a simple microscopic tube, and
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.400]   from there we grow into this bigger and bigger tube, and we
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.320]   become more complicated. And each end of the tube does split into
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.040]   various holes. So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.920]   the front end of our body, right? It splits into the nose,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   the mouth, the ears, the sinuses, the tube to the lungs, which is the windpipe,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.640]   the tube down to the stomach, which is the esophagus.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.720]   And then the other end of the tube splits as well. You know, men end up with
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.480]   two holes, and women end up with three holes. You
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   know, the urethra, the vagina, and the anus, and men just, you know, the urethra
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.280]   and kind of the reproductive system, they share a hole.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.480]   - I'm learning a lot today. It really is incredible that you start
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.240]   from sperm and an egg, and you have some DNA information,
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.440]   and from that, the building project begins.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.680]   And then what that leads to is like a pizza dough, and then you roll
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.280]   it into a tube, and that tube then
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:34.640]   eventually sort of becomes more and more complicated, and gets eyes and a brain,
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.440]   and then can create a Twitter account. So from, it's really incredible
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.480]   that we're just a fancy tube. - Right, we are. And we sprout eyes and a
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.640]   brain, and a sense of smell and taste, pretty much to regulate what comes in
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.600]   the front of the tube. You know, we don't want to eat anything
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.280]   dangerous or poisonous. You know, we want to choose what we eat,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.200]   even choose who we kiss. - Well, we seem to be motivated by what comes out of the
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.840]   tube as well, in part. That's not just output. It's a
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.360]   feedback mechanism, seemingly. Like, we're also monitoring the
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.080]   functioning of the output. We're not just obsessed about the input.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.760]   - We're very obsessed with the output. You're absolutely right about that.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.560]   People, you know, have medical complaints about their output very often that are,
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.160]   you know, I never cease to be surprised by a new kind of complaint
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.120]   or observation about the output. - I think people have gone to wars over
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.560]   the output, and maybe sometimes the lack of the output, or the desire for output
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.960]   for the particular other humans that you fancy. The brain and the eyes
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.640]   that sprouted somehow convinced the rest of the body that this one
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.960]   particular other tube is fanciful, so you're going to go to major
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.360]   wars and lead global suffering because of the fancy
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.880]   and the desire for additional output with the other
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:09.360]   tube. Okay, so that's, so on the throat, that part of the tube,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.640]   is it, you said the design is not, you could have thought of maybe a little
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.360]   bit better options because it's too multifunctional. Is that,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.480]   can you sort of elaborate on the multifunctional nature
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.240]   of this part? Are a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.160]   or do you find that more specialization is going to get the job done better?
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   - There is a lot of organs, for instance, do have multiple functions, you know, the
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.000]   pancreas is, has two, it's like two organs in one. One, you
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.520]   know, secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream, and the other aspect of
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.040]   it secretes digestive enzymes into the gut to help
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   you digest and absorb food. The liver is like 15 organs in one, it's
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.760]   just amazing how many different things it does.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.800]   But the throat, you know, so basically the problem with the throat is, as I said,
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.120]   we have two tubes that are right next to each other in the throat. One is for food,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.040]   drink, saliva, mucus, snot, whatever you're going to swallow,
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.480]   all of that stuff must go down the esophagus, the food tube, and end up in
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.960]   the stomach. And right next to the esophagus,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.480]   millimeters away, is the windpipe, or the trachea, which
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.720]   goes down to the lungs. And your throat does these daily
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.600]   gymnastics to keep everything but air out of the
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.040]   windpipe, because, you know, you slip up once and you can
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.720]   die. You can choke, you know, you laugh or speak while eating,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.960]   and it's curtains, unfortunately. So it seems like, you know, every aspect of the
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.760]   body, when I was learning about it in med school, seems so
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.920]   brilliant and so perfectly designed by evolution, or
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.440]   whoever you might think designed it, to, you know,
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.680]   favor survival, to enhance life. But the throat seemed the opposite. It
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.400]   seemed set up almost for failure. And, you know, we developed all these
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.560]   mechanisms as a compensation, right? We have the gag reflex whenever
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.600]   food or something is headed towards your
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   airpipe, your windpipe, or down to your lungs, your throat has this sort of, like,
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.040]   rejection of it, it pushes it away in a gag reflex.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.560]   At the same time, we have a cough, which is something our body does when
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.600]   something inappropriate does get down the windpipe, you know, when we
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.720]   get a little food down the wrong pipe, we end up coughing, and the coughing does
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.960]   usually flush it out and get rid of it. We even have something called the mucus
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.480]   elevator in our lungs, which is this constant
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.760]   flow of mucus up the airways, up to the trachea,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.040]   dragging with it all kinds of particulates that we've inhaled, and
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.400]   perhaps some food that went down the wrong pipe, and drags it up into the
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.080]   throat, and we swallow it kind of unconsciously all day, every day,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.760]   is the truth. Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated,
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.840]   you know, it uses a number of cranial nerves, it uses over 15 different
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.680]   muscles, it's this coordinated act to
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.080]   keep food out of the airway, you know, you can see someone's Adam's apple in their
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.040]   neck kind of jump upward when they swallow,
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.120]   which helps lift the airway up against this kind of, the epiglottis,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.160]   which plugs it closed and allows food or swallowed drink to kind of skirt
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.400]   just past it. But every time we swallow, those things do come within millimeters
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.360]   of going down the wrong pipe, and it's just thanks to these kind of
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.040]   compensations, these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat that
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.400]   keeps us alive. As I actually took a sip of water, it's
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.720]   kind of, it makes you appreciate the wonderful
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.640]   machinery of it all. By the way, we have pulled up your
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.080]   Instagram that people should follow. You have a post about the throat,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:49.040]   and just showing so many different components from the tongue
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:56.320]   to the trachea, the esophagus, just the entire machinery of it all.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.680]   The teeth for the chewing, it's so interesting. And so a lot of
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.360]   the structure of this, the anatomy and the physiology,
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.960]   does it echo other mammals? Are we just basically borrowing a lot of
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.280]   stuff from evolution and maybe making small adjustments, maybe due to
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:21.040]   the fact that we're not using our mouth to murder things as other predators
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.200]   might? We use our thumbs? -Exactly, we have hands. We don't need
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.960]   to bite them. Yeah, there's a lot of overlap between
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.560]   different animals, which I find very comforting and fascinating.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.000]   You know, someone asked me, "Is there any animal in which the throat is better
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.520]   designed?" And my first thought was whales, because the blowhole's kind of
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.240]   up on the top of their heads. I was thinking, "Oh, maybe
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.760]   they are more separate." But when I looked into it, actually, no.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.920]   You know, the paths do come very close, just like in us. And
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.080]   I saw a paper about some new discovered organ that actually helps
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.680]   keep food and drink out of the airway in whales that they hadn't ever noticed
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.480]   before. So it's a different mechanism, but the same
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.400]   kind of basic problem is that, you know, we're tubes, and the air tube
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   and food tube are right next to each other.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.240]   -How well do we understand, so just even link your hand, this little part,
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.920]   is there still mysteries about the complexity of the system? Because you
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.800]   mentioned, just even for swallowing, all these parts
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.480]   in the brain that are responsible and all the different things that have to,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.600]   like an orchestra, play together. Do we have a
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   good sense from both a medical perspective and a biology perspective,
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.960]   or is there still mysteries? -There's definitely still mysteries. We understand
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.120]   a lot about, for instance, how the swallowing
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.760]   mechanism, you know, is coordinated in the brainstem, sometimes using
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.080]   some higher levels of the brain. But it is a very thoughtless thing, as
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.720]   you mentioned when you drank the water. You know, it's not something we have to
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.880]   think about, thankfully, or we'd be thinking about it all day.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.240]   There's a lot we don't understand about the basic mechanisms, perhaps about
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.080]   how the nerves fire and how they kind of, you know,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.400]   coordinate on the microscopic level, how ions rush into and out of
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.840]   nerve cells to kind of create that electrical signal. But
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   we sure understand a heck of a lot, and it's very fascinating.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.680]   -So, moving on to chapter two, we'll jump around.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:18.160]   And you actually said the liver does a lot of things. I also saw you
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:23.920]   retweet something where it said, you know, showing that the
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   liver is bigger than the heart, which is the body or the universe's way
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.960]   of saying you should drink more and care less.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:37.680]   It's a good line. So you give props, like you said, to the kidney, to the
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.120]   liver, to the organs, to the parts that don't often
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.960]   get as much credit as they deserve. But let us go for a time
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:54.240]   to the human heart. We get chest pain. We talk about it when we talk about
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.440]   love, for some reason. Why do we talk about the heart when we
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.440]   talk about love? -There sometimes can actually be some chest pain involved in
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.600]   love. I remember when I was a med student,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.840]   I was very smitten with another medical student who was totally brilliant and
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.040]   beautiful. And it actually does cause this kind of
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.760]   burning in your chest. I don't know what that is.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.520]   I don't think it's from the heart itself. I don't know if it was like acid reflux
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.840]   because I was so nervous. I'm not really sure.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.600]   But I definitely felt something in my chest whenever I saw her.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.120]   I don't know what that is. But you could see why someone might think, oh, you know,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.600]   maybe it is your heart. That's kind of the most prominent organ
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.480]   in your chest. When people come to the ER with chest pain, you know, the big
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.760]   question is, is it my heart? And that's my main job, is figuring out if it is or
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.680]   not. So I could see why. You know, the way
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.560]   ancients saw the functions of different organs is fascinating, but often
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.680]   hard to explain. -Would it be fair to say that if you look at the entirety of
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.160]   human history, the way most people die has to do with the
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.800]   heart? -Well, like in America today, cardiovascular
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.760]   disease and coronary artery disease is one of the
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.640]   most common, perhaps the most common cause of death.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.880]   You know, 100 years ago, 200 years ago, it was probably not. People were not
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.320]   living as long and people were dying of infections that we tend to
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.840]   die less of these days. -Sure. That's true. But
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.160]   in terms of things to stab, so I'm trying to sort of
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.520]   introspect, like, why talk about the heart and love?
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.040]   My thought would be that is because the heart was seen as the most important
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.600]   organism. It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.280]   The originator of life and the way you figure that out from sort of an ancient
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.760]   perspective is when you stab things,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.960]   what is likely to lead to issues. It's like,
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   it's possible to imagine that the brain is not as special as we might think
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.560]   from when you don't understand modern biology
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   or physiology or neuroscience, all those kinds of things.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.400]   Especially because pain, you know, it's painless too.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:09.440]   If you stab it, the brain, I mean. -Yeah. -Yeah, anyway, so that's really
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.600]   interesting. I'm sure there's a kind of a poetic answer to maybe
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.640]   the way people wrote about it, but what to you is the wisdom in the
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.920]   design of the heart? -I mean, the main function of the heart
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.520]   basically is to push blood through the cardiovascular system, through the
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.680]   branching blood vessels to feed every cell in the
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.720]   body. You know, when I believe our ancestors
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.280]   started off as single-celled organisms floating in some ancient brew,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.480]   and they were surrounded by the medium that would bring them all the nutrients
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.520]   they needed, so there's no issues there. And then once you start getting
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.200]   multicellular organisms that are thicker and the ones on the
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.800]   inside aren't in contact with that sort of nutritious brew that they're
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.680]   growing in, you kind of need a way to distribute
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.720]   those nutrients to every cell. And so that's what the heart and the
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.440]   branching vascular tree do. So the heart, you know, it's the most, the
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.560]   biggest disconnect between how the organs talked about in poetry and
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.440]   through history versus its actual function is probably the
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.040]   heart, because we ascribe all these things like love and passion
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.480]   and life itself sometimes to the heart. But actually it's just a simple
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.360]   mechanical pump, you know, that's all it is. I don't want
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.280]   to downplay it, it's amazing. But, you know, it just pushes. It fills the
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.920]   blood and then squeezes it, fills the blood and squeezes it, and just that
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   squeezing, that pushing creates the blood pressure that you need to get
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.040]   blood to every cell in your body, especially when you're standing upright
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.080]   to get blood to your brain, you need a certain amount of pressure to
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.640]   get it up there. -Isn't it amazing to you how much volume
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.000]   of blood just gets pushed through by this pump?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.320]   -Absolutely. They say every red blood cell takes about five minutes to
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.160]   circulate and come back to the heart. And that circulation kind of, you
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.240]   know, starts in the womb and continues and kind of until the moment that we
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.200]   die. But the volume is tremendous and it can never, you know, take a break
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   basically. -And it's sort of propagating all kinds of stuff throughout the
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:09.120]   body. It's a delivery mechanism, blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:17.360]   stuff. Nutrition, drugs, all that. -Right, medications too. -Medications.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.280]   Such a fascinating design. -And it also takes the waste away, you know, it
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.400]   kind of brings the nutritious stuff, brings the nutrients, especially oxygen
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.160]   but many other things. And then it also, as it passes the cell, takes the
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.720]   cell's waste. So it's sort of the fresh water and the sewage system in
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:39.520]   one. -So about blood, what to you is fascinating about blood? So we talk
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.520]   about the pump that spreads the blood, but the blood itself? -Right, so the
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.800]   blood itself is sort of, I mean, it's the most important bodily fluid of
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.200]   course. You know, from moment to moment every cell in the body needs a flow
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.400]   of blood to bring it, most importantly oxygen, but also again all the other
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.080]   nutrients and to take away waste. And if that stops for even a few moments,
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:05.280]   you can be in big trouble. So blood is sort of, you know, the most important
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.840]   medium. It's also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body. It does have this
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:16.000]   kind of all-seeing quality to it where, you know, we can evaluate organs
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.960]   through the blood. I can tell you about your liver, your heart, your kidney just
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.680]   by taking a sample of your blood. So it's sort of like this crystal ball in a way
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.960]   and we use it kind of all the time, you know, to assess someone's health, to
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:35.440]   assess their disease. -Is it also the attack vector for diseases, for bacteria,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.680]   for viruses and all that kind of stuff? So viruses seem to attack either the
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.880]   throat, maybe you can correct me, but they seem to attack different parts of the
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:50.400]   body depending on how easy it is to access and how easy it is to get in deep
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.480]   depending on what you prefer. If you want to do a little bit of hard work but you
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   get in deep or you don't want to do the hard work but you don't get in deep,
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.760]   those are the choices viruses have. But is blood one of the sort of attack
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.640]   vectors? What's like, if you were trying to break into the human body, like a
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.840]   parasite, a virus, a bacteria, how would you do it? Like what would you, what would
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.440]   be the attack vectors you would explore? -Right, so you got to look for the body's
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.760]   weaknesses of course. You know, we have inherent weaknesses, for instance, like
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.400]   our respiratory tract. We have to breathe, we have to get air in from the outside,
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.320]   and so that's one of the entries into the body. And so, you know, when we inhale,
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.080]   let's say a poisonous gas, you know, it's an easy way in. You have to breathe,
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.720]   you can't hold your breath very long, but you know, air in our lungs is still kind
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.320]   of contiguous with the external atmosphere. It's not really inside the
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.440]   body until it does cross across the lining of the alveoli into the blood, as
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.640]   you said. That's when it really gets inside. And the other, besides the
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.840]   respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract is another way,
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.360]   kind of a chink in the armor. You know, we have to eat, we have to drink,
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.200]   and therefore we're taking the external world into ourselves, into our gut,
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.280]   in order to extract from it what we need and let the rest kind of flow out.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.400]   So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, you know, there's a
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.200]   reason that, you know, respiratory tract infections
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.480]   and gastrointestinal infections are kind of the most common that
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.560]   afflict us, because those are the ways in to the body. So I would definitely pick
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.160]   one of those. Not just be a lazy cold in the nose, but
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.600]   really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep in the lungs and get across that
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.640]   barrier into the blood. But also the whole sex thing
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.720]   that humans do. So speaking of which, let us go
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:41.760]   for time to the genitals chapter. So what are genitals? I think I've heard
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.120]   of those. I think I've read about a penis and a
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.680]   vagina. Can you explain to me how those work? Just asking for a
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.160]   friend. But also, what do you use fascinating about it?
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:00.080]   And maybe what's misunderstood or little known about them?
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.280]   Sure. So they're very unique organs, I would say.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.360]   One of the things that I like to point out is that, you know, while every organ
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.600]   from moment to moment keeps us alive and ensures our survival, the genitals are
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.680]   in a way the opposite. We don't need them from moment to moment. You
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.600]   don't even have to use them at all. And in fact, they often make us do stupid
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.840]   things that are the opposite of enhancing survival.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.480]   And they've affected the brain, and you can become sort of focused and
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.240]   nuts based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals. So
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.600]   they can be dangerous organs too. But you know, I mean,
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.120]   sexual dimorphism helps with genetic variability,
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.880]   as it does in so many other organisms. You know, you take two people and mix
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.000]   them together, their genetics, you just get a lot more variation
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.040]   and more opportunities to try different genetic codes and see what will
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.160]   enhance survival, as we talked about sex and death.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.680]   I talk about in the book a lot of, for instance, the female genital tract,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.640]   how the uterus is very unusual because, you know, it doesn't even sort of wake up
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.360]   and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:11.680]   You know, it's even though babies, female babies are born with all of the
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.960]   eggs they'll ever have in their ovaries already, they're just sort of
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.800]   in this stasis until they start waking up kind of once a month.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.320]   And it's this cycle, you know, there's so much in our bodies that are cyclical
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.360]   and rhythmic, the heartbeat, the breathing. But menstruation is kind of a very
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.840]   strange rhythm that takes over a decade to start, and
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.680]   only, you know, the rhythm beats once a month, which is very slow compared to
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.520]   every other rhythm of the body. The other unusual thing is, you know, in
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.120]   medicine, when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.880]   those are emergencies, right? When your heart stops, that's a cardiac arrest,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.000]   you need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.440]   When your breathing stops, you know, you need a breathing machine to breathe for
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.800]   you or something to reverse whatever might be causing the suppression of your
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.480]   breathing. But when menstruation stops, it's the
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.760]   point of menstruation in the first place. The whole reason that the uterus grows a
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:10.960]   lining and sheds it each month is to one day, you know, get the ovum to
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.280]   get fertilized and for it to implant in the lining,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.960]   and then the rhythm ceases. And that's obviously not a medical emergency, unlike
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.640]   most other rhythms, you know, cessations. It's the point of the whole thing in the
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.880]   first place. So these particular penis and vagina are
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.800]   that whole thing, the uterus, whatever. Am I not using the wrong terms?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.080]   I don't know. I'll just keep saying... You use those terms.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.200]   There's more technical, there's parts, various, various parts.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.880]   In medical school you learn every bump and, you know,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.840]   every little part of every little organ, including the genitals.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   I never really thought of it this way, as you said,
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.440]   is that most organs are kind of full-time employees,
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.080]   like 24/7 they're doing something. And then there's some organs,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.680]   penis, vagina being representative of this, they're not
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.040]   functioning all the time. They're only functioning every once in a
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.640]   while and then get us to do stupid stuff or awesome stuff and all
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.920]   that kind of stuff. But they're not essential for human survival on a
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:16.720]   second by second basis. And that the whole cyclical nature of
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:20.400]   the human body... How many other cycles are on a monthly
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.720]   basis, like that far apart? That's a fascinating
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.520]   design that the human body would do that and
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.400]   wouldn't start until the second decade of life.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.680]   It's almost like... What do I want to say?
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.840]   There's some kind of meta-planning going on.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:44.400]   Like this is the optimal solution for the sexual selection mechanism
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:51.920]   among like somewhat intelligent species. Like it's useful to, after the brain has
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.120]   developed sufficiently long, to now be making
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.720]   sexual selection decisions. Like you need time for this
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:05.760]   computer, this really powerful computer, to load in the info.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.200]   Interesting. You also need the body to develop, you know, a child
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.880]   simply isn't big enough to be pregnant and deliver
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.560]   another baby. I wonder if there's animals in which this happens at a
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.160]   much more accelerated pace in different stages. Definitely, especially
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.920]   certain kinds of insects, you know, like Drosophila,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.800]   a lot of the fruit fly, a lot of experiments are done on because their
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.560]   life cycle is so rapid. A lot of insects
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.480]   and other creatures are almost ready to mate as soon as they're born.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.520]   Not us. Not us. Is there any
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.320]   improvements to the design? So a lot of people are
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.680]   very interested in these particular body parts.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:53.600]   If you were to sort of step back as a geneticist, biological designer, or maybe
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.960]   a computer scientist, computer engineer, trying to build
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:02.400]   a human 2.0 or maybe a robot, how would you improve
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.360]   the penis and the vagina? Well, the penis for starters, I mean,
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.640]   let's also discuss the testicles, you know, they're very important too.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:15.200]   I mean, okay, so they're fragile and they're important and yet
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.640]   they're hanging off the body in danger, basically. So,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.880]   does that make sense? You know, they begin in the womb, they begin inside the
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.960]   abdomen and they slowly descend and sometimes before birth, sometimes
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.040]   in the first year of life, sometimes never,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.560]   they pop out of the body and end up hanging in the scrotum.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.720]   There's a reason, because the chemical reactions that create sperm
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   function best at a few degrees cooler than body temperature.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.480]   And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:48.640]   they might hang further down and in the cold weather they scrunch themselves up
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.000]   to get closer to the body to maintain that ideal temperature a
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.560]   few degrees cooler. So it's hard, you know, if you could
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.000]   create a sperm production mechanism that did not rely on that lower temperature,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.560]   that would be great, keep them inside the body protected like
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.240]   the ovaries are. But, oh, then you wouldn't rely on the
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.720]   lower temperature. I thought you meant create some kind of weird internal
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.000]   cooling mechanism. No, well, I guess that would be one
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.240]   solution, but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction, you know, would
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.760]   not be reliant on the lower temperature, let's say.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.160]   You know, it'd be great to design a sperm metagenesis or sperm production
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.200]   process that would function best at body temperature
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.480]   and then we can keep those delicate organs inside the body
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.760]   and not have them hanging out in danger. Or maybe the argument for this design
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:43.360]   is maybe it's nice to put them in danger so you
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.480]   are constantly concerned about it. Could be.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.000]   Maybe that's beneficial for male psychology, I'm not really sure.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.200]   There's a psychological element here about the evolution that could be.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:00.560]   So that's the testicles. Penis? A better way to do it, you know,
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.840]   I mean, it's pretty good as it is, you know, it kind of,
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.240]   when it's time for it to work, it grows and stiffens and when it's time for it
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.960]   not to work, it kind of shrinks and hangs out.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.200]   I saw this on a Seinfeld episode, so I know how it works.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.240]   Shrinkage. Yeah, that was a good one. But, you know, that's also a bit
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.560]   unique, I suppose, that, you know, the way it has this erectile tissue.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.640]   Actually, they're similar. In the mouth of certain baleen whales,
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.240]   there's a certain similar kind of erectile tissue that
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.320]   helps cool them off because they have so
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.760]   much blubber and create so much heat in moving
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.800]   around and feeding that they have actually a similar, similar to the penis
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.000]   organ in their mouth that helps cool their bodies because it's a big problem.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.400]   They have to store all that blubber for fuel, but it makes them too hot. So as a
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.280]   compensation, they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:01.840]   Okay, what about vagina? You know, the fact that miscarriages
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.680]   sometimes happen because of sexually transmitted diseases,
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.280]   because of trauma, you know, it'd be great if the uterus,
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.240]   where the growing fetus is, is sort of even more protected from those things.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:19.120]   You know, I guess that's a side effect of the fact that
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.080]   people still have sex when they're pregnant, are still, you know, exposed to
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.720]   injury. If there was a way to make it more
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.280]   protected, perhaps that would be even better.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.680]   I did see an article recently about artificial wombs, which are
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.480]   rapidly becoming a reality. And in animal studies, they're able to prolong the
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:41.520]   gestation of a fetus by a month in an artificial womb. Can you explain
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.280]   the artificial aspect of the artificial womb? Sure, it's,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   I believe it acts almost like a heart-lung bypass machine. So when
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.840]   someone's getting like bypass surgery, their heart is stopped. Literally, they
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.240]   throw ice in the chest and they give a potassium infusion through
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:04.160]   the blood, which stops the heart. But the blood is run through a machine
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.720]   that basically does the work of the heart and lungs together, gets oxygen
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.600]   into the blood, and then pushes it back into the body.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.880]   So I believe it's a sort of similar mechanism to keep blood and
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:20.160]   nutrition flowing to this fetus. And so it's just not inside the body
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.840]   of a parent, it's in some kind of other device. But I think
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.240]   that science is going to rapidly improve. One benefit is, you know,
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.200]   babies are born premature, and while, you know, neonatology is able to
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.000]   continuously kind of lower the age of viability
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.520]   through better technology and understanding how, what you can,
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.800]   medicines and other things you can do to premature babies when they're born,
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.760]   you know, ideally, if let's say premature labor
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.360]   begins, you can't stop it. That baby's coming out one way or the
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.160]   other. If you could just then stick it into an artificial womb where it can
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:56.000]   continue its development, that would save a whole host of problems
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.040]   off. And those babies born very early suffer from
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.160]   damage to various organs, including the brain, you know, for the rest of their
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.800]   life. So that could be a very important technology.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:09.920]   So some aspects of the human body, we can develop technologies that outsource
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.560]   them, sort of
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:18.160]   offload some of the stress and the workload from the human body
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.240]   to do it elsewhere. Like dialysis does that for kidneys, you know, people can
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.760]   live decades without kidneys as long as they
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.880]   get dialysis, which does the work for them.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.320]   Not every organ can do that. For instance, the liver, there's no
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.240]   dialysis version for the liver. Like if your liver fails, you need a liver
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.400]   transplant and that's the only thing that's gonna
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:45.600]   do it for you. So that's the world's first artificial womb for humans
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:50.240]   and we're looking at a picture of what looks like gigantic balloons.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.680]   Matrix, here we come. This is very matrixy.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.120]   How are they floating? What are we even looking at?
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:03.680]   There's giant red spheres. This really looks like the matrix.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.120]   I wonder where it's from. So there seems to be a paper on this too.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.240]   I don't know too much about it, but I did see that
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.960]   it's advancing very rapidly. The world's first artificial womb for humans.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:19.200]   Scientists in the Netherlands say they're within 10 years of developing an
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.000]   artificial womb that could save the lives of premature
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.480]   babies. Premature birth before 37 weeks is globally the biggest cause of death
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.800]   among newborns, but the development also raises ethical
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.240]   questions about the future of baby making
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.520]   and so on and so forth. Wow. We're going to be facing a lot of ethical
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.000]   questions as we start to mess
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:51.440]   with human biology. In an effort to help human biology, we might start to mess
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.560]   with it. And it's going to be very interesting as
[00:59:54.560 --> 01:00:00.880]   we take steps towards the matrix.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:09.360]   All right. What about the neighbor's poop feces? There seems to be
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:16.640]   a lot of interesting stories in that particular output as well.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:22.480]   What to you is fascinating?
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.480]   What to you maybe is misunderstood or little known about
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:35.600]   poop? Well, it's hilarious for one thing. Yeah. That we do it. Oh, okay. The word is
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.920]   great as well. Yes. There's so many different words.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.760]   I do, you know, when I'm talking to the parents of pediatric patients, I use the
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.080]   word poop. I don't often when I'm talking to adult
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.960]   patients try to choose a more mature word. But
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.880]   poop is amazing. I mean, I guess it's, you know, it's sort of the most,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.160]   the dirtiest, the most vile, the most hated aspect of our bodies. It's the
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.720]   grossest. We don't want to think about it, talk
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.200]   about it, have it anywhere near our, you know, food or in social
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.880]   interactions. With good reason, you know, I mentioned
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.840]   gastrointestinal infections are one of the most common infections the human
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.760]   body suffers from. And, you know, what we call the way they
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.120]   spread from person to person, grossly enough, is referred to as the
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.800]   fecal-oral route, which means a bit of someone's stool is
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.760]   getting into your, you're swallowing it, you know,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.840]   through the water supply. For instance, diarrhea is actually quite
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.280]   a brilliant mechanism of these microbes, right? If you, let's
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.600]   say you're in the intestine of one person,
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.880]   your goal is to get into the intestines of another person.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.360]   Brilliant to just trick their intestines into secreting all this fluid
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.680]   into the intestines to increase the volume of stool and its runniness
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.720]   so that when they do poop it gets into the water supply and then everyone else
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.320]   kind of ends up getting infected as well. Wow, that's brilliant.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.840]   Just the same way, like, you know, tuberculosis or coronavirus
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.200]   kind of infects your lungs and makes you cough and you send it out into the air
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.440]   and it ends up in other people's lungs. And that's all
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.040]   evolution. Yeah, it's brilliant. So diarrhea
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.640]   is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson. It's one of the most intelligent things
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.320]   we can do as an entirety of an organism, not just
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.880]   the particular cognitive organism, but there's,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.720]   you know, we're made up of bacteria and viruses and
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.240]   there's a lot of visitors and so on. As the entirety of the system, diarrhea is
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.800]   one of our better accomplishments. It's fascinating.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.160]   Well, I wonder, why is poop funny? I think a lot of that is socially
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.080]   constructed, just how it's sort of supposed to be hidden away, yet something
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.920]   we always do, something, you know, we chuckle about as children.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.000]   But even in healthcare, you know, it becomes this big topic of conversation
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.880]   because you end up talking about it constantly. Like, in the
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.840]   ER, people come in, they're complete strangers, sometimes like
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.280]   a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother and all of a sudden I have
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.320]   to ask her all about what's happening in the bathroom, like
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.760]   is she straining, what color is it, what, you know,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.320]   what's the consistency, does it float on top of the water more than it should, is
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.600]   it hard to flush? I mean, there's a million different questions you learn
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.760]   as a medical student and you're like this poop detective when people
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.240]   come in with issues. And so it's funny, I guess, you know,
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.760]   in the exam room with the doctor-patient relationship, there's sort of no
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.400]   barriers, you know, you talk about everything and you're talking about the
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.920]   most intimate details of a person's life, even though you just
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.520]   met them a second ago. It's so different than normal social
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.200]   interactions, yet there is this social aspect. A lot of
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.560]   what I do is social, you know, it seems like doctors, what they do is mostly
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.280]   scientific, but actually it's just relating to
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.640]   another person and you have to maintain, you know, your
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.000]   professional demeanor and this normal human level interaction, even though
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.480]   you're talking about poop. And that's a skill, that's an art and a
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.280]   science. Well, okay, actually I want to linger on
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   that because I'm a fan of just diving into conversations right
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.160]   away with strangers, just getting no small talk.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.040]   And this is like the ultimate, I don't know if it's the ultimate, but it's one
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.000]   version of no small talk. You get right to the point.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.400]   That's really powerful from a psychology perspective. You're a kind of therapist
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.720]   or you have the power to be a therapist. I don't mean
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.040]   just about the medical condition of the body, but
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.640]   the psychological. There's so much fear connected
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:39.920]   to this concern. Also self-doubt,
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.360]   insecurities, even sort of existential thoughts about your
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.640]   mortality, all of those things are right there in the room. So I think one
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.120]   way doctors deal with that is they kind of have
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   this cold way about them. They almost have that dual mode. One is
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.600]   like, I'm going to be friendly on the surface and cold
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.840]   about the brutal honesty of the biology.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.760]   But I wonder if there's like a skillful middle ground,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.680]   this dangerous place where you can help people
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.280]   deal with their psychological insecurities, concerns,
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.040]   fears, all those kinds of things. Is that just really tough to do?
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.080]   Yeah, it's a huge part of being a doctor is
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.840]   dealing with the psychological aspects of whatever's going on with the patient's
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.520]   body. I mean in the ER you deal with psychiatric emergencies kind of left and
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.040]   right more than ever these days. That's a huge
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.440]   issue, not to mention drug use, alcohol-related stuff,
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.360]   that gets into psychology and the human love of intoxicants and
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.760]   changing the brain's chemistry. And habit, of course, we're
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.840]   creatures of habit and that plays in as well.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.080]   I mean a big part of, for instance, pediatrics is reassuring parents
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:01.200]   and kind of convincing them, giving them the confidence that what's going on with
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.280]   their child is not serious, will go away on its own, does not need any particular
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.560]   intervention. But adults too, you know,
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.720]   reassurance is a huge part of the game. Yeah, you know, in the ER
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.400]   you see humanity at its most raw. I feel like you get
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   this tremendous insight into people, how they live, what they worry about, what
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   they think about, how their body works, and also how their mind works that
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.600]   you almost don't see anywhere else. It's a really interesting
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.760]   place to work. And also the way our society is shaped, the ER is where
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.760]   people go for almost everything. When they're suicidal, they come to the ER.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.040]   When they're too high on drugs to walk, they come to the ER. You know, children
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.400]   who have been abused, sexually abused, physically abused, come to the ER for us
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.840]   to investigate. It's sort of like the all-purpose
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.840]   wastebin for the dregs of society, what people do to themselves and what they do
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.240]   to other people. You know, you mentioned your interest in
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:58.320]   the darkness of humanity. It made me think of the ER, where you really see
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.000]   what human life is like in the ER. Okay, you've, you tweet about, you write
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.520]   about, you think about the emergency room ER.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.760]   That's really fascinating. Just the little window you
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.840]   give to that world is fascinating.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:23.280]   What lessons about humanity do you draw from this place where you're so near to
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:29.040]   death, there's so much chaos, there's so much variety of what's wrong,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:35.680]   so little information, or the urgent nature of the
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.280]   information inflows such that you can't really reason
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.720]   sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data, all those kinds of things.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.000]   You have to act fast and then everybody's freaking out. Can you
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.760]   just speak to the human condition
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.960]   that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.000]   Yeah, I think you do see all those things. I think on
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.640]   on one end of the spectrum, it is this very unique place where you get all
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.360]   these unique insights. On the other end, it can become a ho-hum workplace just
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.760]   like any other, which is sort of surprising. As I
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.200]   mentioned before, humans seem to be able to get used to almost anything,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.280]   and doctors can get ho-hum used to, oh, dying of a heart attack, oh,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.880]   actively in labor and the baby's half out, oh, just
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.320]   ho-hum, I know what to do, going about my job and go home and
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.480]   have dinner with my family and not think too much about it. That's amazing.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.640]   I do try to maintain both my fascination,
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.400]   as I think writers in general tend to think more about what they see,
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.440]   write more about what they see, maybe draw connections with what they see to
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.240]   other things. So I do think that writer's perspective
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   does help me kind of maintain my fascination and my
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.080]   kind of more of an insightful perspective than just a ho-hum,
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.240]   water cooler conversation. But you do see a lot.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.120]   In a way, medical problems are sort of the great equalizer,
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.080]   right? Class, race, culture, background, you know, the failings of the
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.360]   human body, the way it fails, and what we can do to help
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.760]   in those situations is almost universal. I always like this quote from, you know,
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.320]   Chekhov was a doctor and a writer, and he
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.000]   treated a lot of peasants, very low class, and also treated a lot of
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   aristocrats. And he wrote that they all have the same
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.640]   ugly bodies, basically, which I think is really
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.840]   right on. And, you know, it's sort of, you can see people
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.520]   underneath a superficial layer of clothing, maybe it's the most expensive
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.080]   clothing bought from the fanciest places, but
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.040]   underneath their body is still failing in the same way, and they still have the
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.760]   same anxieties, the same worry about mortality,
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.440]   the same concerns about why their poop turned green today,
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.720]   all these things that they bring to the table. So in a way, it is this great
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.760]   equalizer where people are kind of all the same in
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.480]   some ways. Yeah, I feel like people sometimes,
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.960]   class, money, fame, power, makes you for a time forget that
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.840]   you're just a meat vehicle, and
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.160]   you're just as good and just as bad as the other meat vehicles
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:18.080]   all around you. In that sense, there's this question sometimes raised,
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:23.120]   "Are some people better than others?" And I usually answer no to that question
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.560]   because of that. Yeah, some people might be better at math,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.800]   some people might be better at music, but in the end, we're just
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.920]   meatbags. Beautiful as we are. There's a
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.440]   poem that just, a small tangent I want to take, I just
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:48.320]   saw it, "Just Acting," that you have written. I have to,
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.840]   would you classify it as a poem? Yeah. "At first,"
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.320]   if I may read it, "At first you enter the clinic, shoulders weighed down by white
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.680]   coat pockets, book stuffed, timid. You act out a role,
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.600]   your white coat a costume, your questions a script,
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.480]   your demeanor a rehearsed act. No one is going to buy this.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.840]   But then, as you play the role again and again,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.920]   repeating the lines and the motions, the script slowly dissolves,
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.960]   and the interaction becomes thoughtless, and the rehearsed act slowly fades into
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.880]   a profession. You suddenly find yourself unable to tell
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.040]   if you're still acting or if you're doing it for real.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:37.120]   And now you're a doctor. Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard, Massachusetts General
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.000]   Hospital of Medicine, Pediatrics Department."
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.360]   Beautiful. So that is what it is to be a doctor. You're just acting.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.800]   Fake it till you make it. Exactly, fake it till you make it. And I think,
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.960]   I imagine every medical student has this feeling when they first go into a room,
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.000]   like I talked about asking this nice old lady
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.720]   about the color of her poop for the first time, and you're just
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.560]   like, "What am I doing here? Does she believe I'm a doctor?"
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.000]   You know, this just feels absurd. But then it's, again,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.680]   ho-hum becomes normal. Now there's not a sperm chapter in your book.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.520]   You mentioned offline that this is the second and the third
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.280]   book that you're working on all about sperm. No, I'm just kidding.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:28.720]   Or maybe I'm not. Humor tends to make way for reality.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.440]   So the tweet was that an average human male produces
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.000]   500 billion sperm, I believe, which is about four to five times
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.720]   more than the number of people who have ever lived.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.560]   And each of those sperm is genetically unique, so you can
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.240]   think of them, you can kind of imagine the possible humans they could have
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.360]   created, and they're all different. They have
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.600]   similarities, of course, but they have peculiarities that make them different.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.560]   And you can think of all the different trajectories, all the Einsteins, the
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.040]   Feynmans, the Hitlers, and all the people who have died,
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.920]   who would have died during childbirth, who would have died early in their years
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.120]   given the different diseases. It's fascinating to think about.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.960]   An average human, yeah, we're all winners of a very competitive race.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.160]   So the people who make it, we're winners, hashtag winning. Is there
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.360]   something that you find
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:38.320]   fascinating, interesting, beautiful, ugly, surprising about sperm?
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   I think sperm is, yes, it is a very interesting
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.760]   bodily fluid. Maybe I'll write about it in a second or third book, we'll see.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.040]   But I guess sperm is interesting because it's kind of the only
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.200]   projectile bodily fluid from the body.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.440]   Vomit can be projectile. Usually that's a disease state. That's not the
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   expected kind of normal healthy state. Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.280]   no? True, I guess there's some particles in the air. I guess it's
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.760]   not a fluid, I mean not a liquid, but true. I
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.640]   mean, cough in addition to sneeze, right? Sneeze is how
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.440]   our nose gets rid of something that shouldn't be there. Cough is how our
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.360]   lungs get rid of something that shouldn't be there.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.920]   Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs get rid of something that shouldn't be
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.480]   there. All projectiles sometimes in their own
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.800]   way. Sperm is sort of interesting. It's created with the food for its journey.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.680]   Sperm mostly feed off of fructose, a kind of sugar,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   for the few days that they live inside the female genital tract.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.440]   But I like comparing our genitals to the genitals of the plant world,
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.960]   which is flowers. And in the same way that a
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.480]   touch-me-not, for instance, the kind of flower where when you brush up against
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.520]   it, it sort of launches seeds into the distance to
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.720]   try to survive in a way, kind of the sperm is doing something similar,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.800]   launched into the female genital tract, and then all trying to find this,
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.240]   competing against each other to find this egg. It's really amazing.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.760]   And when you learn about it from the biological perspective, the most amazing
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.920]   thing is how many things can go wrong, you know, just in
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.920]   the sperm not surviving long enough for it making it to the egg, and then
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.680]   some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.920]   It's sort of astounding that it works as often as it does, and I think
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.080]   the lesson there is just that people have a lot of sex, and so statistics just
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.200]   favor it's going to work out a good number of times.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.960]   Yeah, and there might be intelligence in the design of just the sheer number of
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.080]   sperm. Maybe that's yet another way to inject
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.640]   variety into the system. And redundancy, I guess, you know, we have
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.400]   two kidneys, we have two hands, if we lose one we can still go on.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.800]   We have, you know, however many millions of sperm get sort of launched
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.360]   in every ejaculation is, you know, if a bunch fail or don't
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.400]   make it inside. There's papers on this, by the way, that
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.440]   I read for some reason, not read, but skimmed
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.640]   for some reason, which is talking about which
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.320]   sperm usually wins, like what are the characteristics of sperms that are
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.640]   winning, and it's not the fastest. So it's
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.720]   apparently there's some kind of slaughter that happens early on, people
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.560]   will correct me, but it's not the fastest.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.320]   There is an aspect of it's the luckiest. It really is,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.280]   like the body tries to make it a random selection.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.920]   It tries to make it fair in making it as random as possible.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.880]   Interesting, and also interesting that they're fueled by fructose. I didn't
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:37.120]   really think about that. So they're a carb-loaded athlete.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.640]   Right, with food for the journey. Food for the journey, because I'm somebody that
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.040]   actually does a lot of running on, I guess you would call me a fat
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   adapted athlete, so I do sort of
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.840]   meat heavy diet, and so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.920]   when you don't eat any carbs, any glucose, any of that kind of stuff,
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.720]   and you're very low. It's interesting to think that sperm are like, nope,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.040]   they're total bros. Let's go to the gym, sprint, performance, short-term
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.600]   performance is everything. All right, well,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.440]   that's sperm. Returning to the liver, the place
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:23.440]   that deals with all our poor decisions. No, many of them, many of our poor
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.240]   decisions. You said that the liver does
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.800]   quite a few things. What to you is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.080]   I'd say its primary function seems to be as the sort of gatekeeper for what we
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.400]   eat and absorb. The entire gastrointestinal
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.920]   tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, the
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.760]   blood flows from it, not back to the heart, but to the liver,
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.120]   where it's first examined, things are evaluated, packaged,
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.120]   processed, detoxified, perhaps. It's kind of this great overseer
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.760]   of what we digest and absorb, and so it kind of keeps
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.680]   track of what's coming in, the outside world that comes in and
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.200]   will become part of us. That's why
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.560]   partly the liver suffers sometimes the injury from
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.600]   certain toxins like alcohol, but beyond that, the liver is also the place,
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   as I said, it metabolizes things too. So it metabolizes alcohol
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.600]   and why it can be injured by alcohol. It metabolizes drugs like Tylenol, which is
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.040]   why Tylenol can be very toxic to the
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.360]   liver when taken as an overdose. So the liver,
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.680]   you know, even beyond that, the liver produces a lot of different
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.640]   things that float in the bloodstream. It packages
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.000]   cholesterol and fats and sends them to where they're needed.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.840]   It deals with protein in the blood. It deals with clotting factors in the blood,
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.640]   helping the blood clot. It processes things like bilirubin
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.760]   and other things that really, as I mentioned, is like 15 organs wrapped
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.800]   into one. Maybe that's why it's sort of the biggest internal organ.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.320]   The skin's bigger, but it's not an internal organ.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   - Right. The biggest organ in the human body is the skin.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.920]   - Right. But the liver is the biggest internal organ, and it really is a
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.280]   powerhouse and does a lot, which is why when people
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:21.360]   suffer from liver failure, kind of everything goes wrong in a way.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.520]   - And in terms of replacing organs, what are organs that are easily
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.200]   replaceable, which are not? Like on the list of things that are hard
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.880]   to replace and not, where would you put it number one? Where
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.720]   would you put it like at the bottom? - Well, let's say the kidneys are, you know,
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.680]   nothing's easy, but kidneys are easiest in a way.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.360]   Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there is that other people have two of them
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.160]   and can give one to you, so you don't have to wait for people to die, which is
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.840]   the case with hearts and livers. Sometimes you can take a part of a liver
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.760]   from someone who's alive, and the liver does have this kind of
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.120]   mythological ability to regenerate itself.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.960]   In the myth of Prometheus, he's, you know, chained to a rock,
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.800]   and the bird eats his liver every day, and it grows back every day.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.640]   And that's actually biologically accurate. It's not that you can
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.200]   completely get rid of it and it'll appear again, but when
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.920]   pieces of it are removed or injured, it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.840]   So I'd say the kidneys, the fact that they're more around.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.120]   Also, it's, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ. It's often just, you don't
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.640]   have to put a transplanted kidney where the kidney should be in the back
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.440]   of the abdomen. You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there,
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.960]   because it's a smaller organ. The liver would be hard because it's huge.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.320]   And I guess we just have the most experience with
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.760]   kidney transplants, because they are the most common.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:46.240]   And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:52.000]   Brain, as far as I know, hasn't been successfully done. The heart is done.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.720]   And definitely, I've evaluated a lot of patients with a heart transplant.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.280]   It does work pretty well. The mechanical heart substitutes are also
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.360]   advancing quite rapidly these days. For a failing heart, there's certain kinds
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.840]   of devices they can surgically implant. Like when a failing heart isn't able to
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.120]   push hard enough, you know, that's the heart's job is pushing blood with
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.440]   sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.360]   When it fails, there are actually these devices you can strap onto the heart
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.920]   to help it pump harder. Those are rapidly advancing. Many of those were not
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.920]   available even 10 years ago when I was a got out of med school, and now they're
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.560]   commonly used. So maybe heart transplant won't be as
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.640]   necessary in the future if those mechanical things do advance. And as I
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.960]   said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.840]   So perhaps it would be the easiest organ to replace with some mechanical device.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.040]   Now for something completely different, returning to testicles for a time. You
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:49.760]   posted an Instagram post of testicles as
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.520]   food. Perhaps eating them doesn't help
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.360]   libido because ingested testosterone is totally
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.040]   metabolized in the liver, returning to our liver,
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.280]   leaving none to reach the bloodstream. That is why testosterone only comes as
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.240]   injection or topical foam, not as pills.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.160]   On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.600]   can be absorbed orally, hence the pill. But
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.280]   testosterone is mostly responsible for libido in women too.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.400]   I was not expecting for this biology lesson when I was
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.920]   looking at an Instagram picture of... Are we looking at testicles?
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:36.240]   Yeah. Are these like which species? I believe all those are from cows.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.760]   From cows. Cows, technically females though, bulls.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.480]   Yeah, well, speaking of which, just we'll jump around a bit, but you've also
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.440]   traveled the world quite a bit.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:55.040]   What have you... what is the craziest food you've eaten
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.720]   across the world? What have you learned about the extremes
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.600]   of the culinary arts by traveling the world?
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:09.280]   I would say, I guess I've always been extra fascinated with the diets of
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.200]   natives of the far north. I spent some time there in Russia
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:19.680]   and in Alaska and always loved their diet. So when I worked in
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.160]   Alaska in an emergency room and did some other
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.680]   travels in Arctic Alaska, and you know, they eat a lot of fat
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.600]   traditionally before contact, you know, more than half of all calories in the
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.400]   Inupiat Eskimo diet came from blubber, marine mammal fat, or you
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.200]   know, also fat from fish, fat from ducks, and other
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.800]   other birds that go up there to mate in the summer. So things like raw whale
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.640]   blubber was especially interesting for me and
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:51.040]   very exciting. You know, I had some beluga whale
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.520]   chowder, things like that. There's just all these
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.640]   very unusual dishes. You know, there's a dish called mikiyuk,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.200]   which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.680]   which is quite delicious actually. So is it cooked? Is it eaten raw?
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.280]   How do they like their fat? Like in
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.640]   in the same way up north in Russia, as you mentioned.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:19.360]   So they often eat it raw. So the raw whale blubber is called mukduk,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.840]   and it's often just sliced thin, and it's like it's sort of cold but not
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.400]   frozen often when they eat it, and they slice it
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.600]   thin. And a lot of people assume it would be very
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.200]   chewy, but it's not that chewy. It's quite pleasant actually, and has this kind of
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.920]   sea smell to it as you're eating it. I quite like it.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:44.160]   And what's the culinary culture like? Meaning is it just source of energy or
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.360]   is it art? Well, there's, you know, traditionally
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.400]   there's not a lot of cooking in the Arctic. A lot of things
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.200]   are eaten raw, partly because there's not a lot of
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.200]   fuel for making fires. So they will, you know, some in some of the
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.960]   big rivers in Russia, for instance, that flow north, they will bring
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.720]   trees, you know, dead trees and logs up to the north, and they can get some wood
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.440]   that way. And same thing in some of the rivers
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.720]   kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.800]   You do get some trees, but just not enough to really produce a
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.400]   culinary art that requires cooking with heat. You know, they do have
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.560]   traditionally blubber lamps where the blubbers of seals and whales are used to
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.520]   create a little flame. Often that's for light and for a little bit of heat,
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:36.800]   and less for cooking. But eating things raw is definitely a huge
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.240]   part of the culture there. And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip out
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.560]   on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska,
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.720]   and two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me,
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.640]   were kind of talking about how eating things raw is sort of the most essential
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.240]   characteristic of Inupiat culture. And the one guy who's half white, half
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.920]   Inupiat, said people often doubt his ethnicity because he looks like a white
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.200]   guy. So he'll, you know, bite the head off of a
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.120]   raw bird to show them that he is truly Inupiat, is what he said.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.960]   That's how you prove you're legit. We're looking at an Instagram pic.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:16.960]   "As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat as the most maligned of all body parts
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.960]   and the culprit in an obesity epidemic. But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.600]   health and survival. In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic, especially
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.800]   human life, is basically a tale of fat. And in Barrow,
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:39.200]   what's it called? Alaska. Alaska, okay. A lawn covered with a whale blubber is
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.960]   still equivalent of a plush green lawn in temperature
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.280]   suburbia swelling in its owner with pride." And that's what
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.440]   we're looking at, is a lawn full of whale blubber.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.720]   A beautiful. And this, so this is, I mean, there's a lot of calories there.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:01.120]   Oh yeah. And this can feed a lot of people. A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.880]   Absolutely. And it's delicious. This was like a,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.720]   I was a kid in a candy store, basically. I rounded a corner in Barrow. So when
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.200]   people do get a whale during the spring whaling season, they raise a flag or the
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.960]   whaling captain raises a flag over his house and everyone in town is welcome to
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.880]   come try some. And so before I went inside
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.560]   to try some, I was kind of playing around with blubber and I saw the,
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.440]   this is a bowhead whale. I saw its heart, which was huge, like the
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.680]   size of a yoga ball. And that was, for me, just like amazing.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.280]   I spent probably the next 45 minutes just looking at all aspects of it. And
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.760]   the stump of aorta that was attached to it was the size of my thigh.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:47.280]   That was really fascinating. It's similar, Alaska and northern Russia, like Siberia
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:52.320]   out there. So where were you? I think you have some pics
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.440]   of from that time. Where were you in Russia?
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.080]   So I spent a lot of time in kind of western Russia as well, but I did
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.920]   take two trips to Kamchatka, including northern Kamchatka.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.800]   I didn't go far enough, nor, I didn't go to Chukotka, for instance, until more
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.960]   recently when I was a ship doctor on a wildlife cruise
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.440]   that sailed from Anadyr, Russia, up to, through the Bering Strait into
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.800]   Wrangel Island. And we stopped in some villages in
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.120]   Chukotka and I got a chance to to try some whale and stuff like that.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.600]   Northern Kamchatka, where it's more the Koryak,
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.200]   are the indigenous people, they do a lot of seal hunting. So I had a lot of seal
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.920]   blubber, but I don't believe they do any whale hunting
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.000]   quite there. But the Chukchi, in a way, are sort of, you know,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.240]   similar to the Inupiat in their diet and their life ways.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.600]   Of course, everyone's diet, all these people's diet, has changed dramatically
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.880]   in the last hundred years, as it has for actually everyone living in
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.240]   kind of modern societies. But for them, perhaps more than anyone
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.560]   else, since their diet was the most extreme,
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.400]   I think, of any human culture on earth. Just to stay
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:03.840]   on the wild travel you did. And I should say, I'm using the word travel, but
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:09.600]   it really, you were a doctor there.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.320]   Well, first of all, can you just comment on the decision to go to
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.360]   such places and to help people to be a doctor there? What was the motivation?
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.840]   What was the thinking behind it? Well, I think I got the travel bug before I ever
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.000]   went to medical school and even wanted to be a doctor. So right after
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.160]   college, I kind of wasn't very into college, didn't enjoy
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.360]   things, kind of wanted to get out there and see the world,
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.680]   get out of New York City where I was a student at NYU.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.240]   The first thing I did after finishing college was, I was invited to be an
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.160]   intern at a research center in St. Petersburg, Russia. I spent six months
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:52.480]   there my first trip and went back four more times to Russia,
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:56.800]   traveled all over, including to Kamchatka twice and other
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.760]   parts of the country I'd never heard of, cities like Petrozavodsk and Siktifkar
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.680]   and Pskov. I didn't even know a word could start with P-S-K,
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:11.040]   like the city of Pskov, but it can. And I was sort of fascinated. I was
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.880]   actually studying the international environmental movement
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.400]   and how it came to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.240]   and how organizations like Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   and the World Bank are trying to kind of push the
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:30.160]   timber industry, which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path. And so
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.440]   sort of evaluating how is it working, if not why
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.320]   not. And that seems like such a little niche,
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.200]   such a small detail about Russian society, but
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.960]   in a way, researching that in depth was almost this window
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.040]   into the entire country and the history in a place I knew nothing about. And I
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.640]   learned the language, traveled all over the country, you know,
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.600]   got to know the food, the history, the literature. It was just an
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.520]   immersive and amazing and life-changing experience that made me
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.600]   want to see every spot on the globe, basically, and learn about every
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.200]   culture. So I took that desire with me to medical
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.320]   school. I decided I would go to medical school,
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:13.280]   and from the very beginning, I was intent on traveling around the world.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.920]   So a lot of my career has been fashioned so that I'm practicing medicine in a
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:21.600]   place with an interesting geographic context, an interesting place
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.720]   with an interesting cultural context. And that just makes it more interesting, I
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.440]   find. Not only are medical services often more
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.720]   needed in these remote and rural parts of the country and world,
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.880]   so I feel like I'm, you know, taking my knowledge and education experience to
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.080]   places where it's needed, but also for me, it's just such an
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.080]   enlightening experience. The way culture, history, geography,
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.200]   climate affects medical disease, but just getting to
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.600]   know the people, getting to know their culture,
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.840]   being a very useful traveler by providing medical services in that
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.200]   place. And that's taken me to Arctic Alaska,
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.400]   to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota. I currently work in
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.440]   a few different parts of Pennsylvania, Appalachia, which,
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.920]   you know, for me is a unique geography and culture that I didn't grow up with,
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.680]   wasn't familiar with. So in some ways, it's exotic for me as
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.920]   well. I worked in other places too, like
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.280]   Kolkata, India, Nepal. Just, I think my love of travel has
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.720]   shaped my medical career, and being a doctor does give you these
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.040]   opportunities to go to places and travel in a unique way, you know,
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.680]   through the medical profession. You know, there's a documentary, Happy
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.600]   People, here in the Taiga or something like that.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:41.360]   I think Warner Herzog voices it. It tells a story of a simple life of
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.760]   survival in the Taiga, and I think they're trapping
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.560]   for food, and there's a lot, there's an alcoholism
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.200]   problem too as well. There's like a very basic
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.280]   life of survival, of loneliness, of desperation, but also there's a,
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:09.840]   I think the underlying claim of the documentary is that
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:16.560]   that simple life actually has a kind of simple happiness to it.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:22.560]   Hence the name, Happy People. Is there, can you speak to the life that people
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.280]   live in in those places, when it may be simpler
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.480]   than you would in a sort of big city life?
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:38.640]   It's definitely very different, for sure. You know, I guess I found, like in some
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.760]   of the remote villages of Kamchatka, I was actually surprised how similar
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.720]   they were in that, you know, there was, I saw the
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.520]   same family strife, the same fights, the same,
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.760]   you know, kind of pairing of relationships and
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.960]   bickering and politics, and you know, in a way,
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.000]   I'm from the New Jersey suburbs, and yet being
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.240]   in this remote, you know, village of northern Kamchatka, I remember writing
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.520]   an email to my friend about how just it seemed so similar, even though on the
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.880]   surface it was this exotic other world. The incredible material know-how they
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.480]   must have to get their food from the land, you know, that,
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:22.320]   the number of animal species, plant species, the behaviors of the animals,
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:27.200]   seasons, how to live that way. In a way, it's more complicated, in a way that I
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.520]   find fascinating, how people live on the land,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.280]   and the knowledge and experience it takes to do it well and survive.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:36.720]   You know, obviously other aspects of modern life in a city are
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.960]   much more complicated than they would be there, but I guess it's,
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.920]   that was something that struck me too, that it's simpler in some ways, but more
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.360]   complicated in other ways. -So some of the complexity that
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.280]   happens in life is from, originated from humans, not from the
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.600]   technology or the, all that kind of stuff around us. -You can
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.360]   take the human out of modernity, but they're still human. -They're still human,
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.880]   and they fill the empty space with their own human complexities.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:09.360]   -Are there people that just stand out, memorable people, memorable
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.200]   experiences from those places?
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:18.960]   Some people that maybe made you smile, made you cry,
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.400]   change who you are as a man, change who you are as a doctor,
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.480]   anything jumps to mind? -I think, you know, when I was, it was interesting when I was
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.240]   in Russia, I found that most of the people I hung out
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.600]   with were old women. I'm not sure why, I mean, they're,
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.280]   actually I didn't meet a lot of old men in Russia, which might speak to kind of
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.040]   life expectancy there for men in particular,
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.200]   but I found women, older Russian women, including, you know,
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.880]   Russian from St. Petersburg or some of the elderly women
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.400]   in Kamchatka who were, you know, some were Koryak, some were half
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.720]   Koryak, half Russian, some were Chukchi. I just found them to have,
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.080]   to be so enlightening the way they talked about
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.480]   history, about people, so insightful about humanity, you know, all they've lived
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.920]   through in the last 50 years in some of these parts of Russia,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.440]   like the upheaval, societal upheaval, the destruction,
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.680]   the building up, it's just something I could not even imagine.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.360]   And I think their insights were just very, I'm not thinking of anything in
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.760]   particular, but I just remember I could listen
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.280]   to some of these elderly women talk about their lives for hours and hours.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.840]   I remember there was this older, elderly blind Koryak woman
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.600]   who you would have thought was the, you know, most country bumpkin of country
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.400]   bumpkin, and yet she couldn't stop talking about how much she loved reading
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.000]   Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, and which might also speak to the Soviet
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.040]   education system. And it's just sort of surprising and
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:46.800]   fascinating, and just those stories and perspectives on life
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:53.600]   really stayed with me. Yeah, with Babushki,
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.880]   there's a wisdom, there's a kindness.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:06.000]   I mean, I suppose that's true for older people in general,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.760]   but there's something about, it's not just Russia, it's Eastern Europe,
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:19.520]   it's like this kind of look of wisdom, and not just like
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.680]   sort of middle-class wisdom or something like that.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:31.760]   It's like, I have seen some shit, wisdom. I've seen it all. And on the other side,
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:38.240]   I'm left here with a pragmatism and a compassion, and also an ability to
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.320]   cook really well. That's for sure, absolutely. There's just
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.760]   this balance of just deep intelligence and deep kindness,
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:51.200]   and yeah, I mean, much of who I am is because of the
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.080]   relationship I had with my grandmother, who is
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:01.760]   a Russian, Ukrainian-born Russian grandmother.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.800]   Did you learn the Russian language? I did. It's quite rusty at this point, but
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.720]   I did. One of these wonderful elderly Russians in
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.080]   St. Petersburg sort of adopted me. I think that was another thing that
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.080]   a lot of these elderly women on every side of the country
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.360]   kind of adopted me or saw me as this real curiosity.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.760]   It's sort of just not, I mean, this was around 2002, 2003, it just wasn't
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.840]   common for this sort of strange American to suddenly show up in the middle of
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.320]   Kamchatka or even St. Petersburg, and just absolutely ravenously
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.400]   curious about everything they had to say.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.800]   So I often got adopted, and one of them taught me Russian and how to ride a
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.440]   horse. So the same babushka taught me both of
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.560]   those things. And like you said also, I should mention
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.080]   that there's something about the Soviet education system where, yeah, everybody
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:57.040]   reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky. It's exceptionally well read, no matter
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.320]   where life has taken you, no matter where you come from,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.120]   the literature, the mathematics, the sciences, they're all like
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.760]   extremely well educated, and that creates a fascinating
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.560]   populace. Like, then you take that education, that excellent
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.480]   early education, and you throw a bunch of hardship
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.960]   at those people, and then they kind of cook in that hardship and come out
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.400]   really fascinating people on the other end.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.400]   It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance, like Russian medical science
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.560]   is not, doesn't, you don't see a lot of sort of studies,
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.160]   medical studies, advancing of medical science come out of Russia,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.800]   which is sort of, I'm surprised sort of, I wish that it would. You know, I visited
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.200]   Akademgorodok outside Novosibirsk, which is an entire city the Soviets created
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.120]   just for the study of science, and it's like
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.480]   there's the geology building, and there's the biology building, and there's the
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.760]   chemistry building, and I just feel like Russia has this
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.920]   potential to be a science powerhouse, or even in the medical sciences, but
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.520]   I guess you just, I don't see it. I'm not sure why.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:13.280]   I mean, you can certainly guess as to why, and I see the same thing in the
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.840]   other, in the sciences. I hold the dearest sort of
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.640]   in computer science, in engineering fields.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:26.960]   I kind of long held this desire by long, I mean, last couple years,
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.360]   because a bunch of people reached out to me
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.040]   from Yandex and Moscow State to give lectures there,
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:37.280]   to sort of connect, you know, why so little science is coming out of
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.000]   there? Why so little that we hear about, and it feels like
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.800]   we should be able to bridge the scientific community.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:50.720]   Like, science, let's even say, even in turmoil of
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.400]   geopolitics, even in global conflict, I feel like science
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.680]   should be bigger than that, but why do we not hear from the
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.960]   scientists is because of the limitations on human freedoms, on scientific freedoms.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:13.040]   I feel like in China, in Russia, in any regime of its sort,
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.480]   you should give freedom to scientists to
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.800]   to flourish, and to interact with others, and you can only grow from that.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.360]   You shouldn't suppress that. The sort of Cold War ideas,
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:32.160]   we should put those aside. As somebody who spent time in Russia, as somebody
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:38.240]   who learned Russian, do you have some thoughts that you want to
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:45.200]   say about the war in Ukraine currently? It's tragic, of course. Seemingly
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.000]   pointless to watch the destruction of a country
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.800]   in real time. I guess it's, you know, when you read
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.680]   Russian history and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.920]   it's sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.080]   The populace being beaten down is a big part of it, you know, from the
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.320]   Mongolian hordes, through the Tsar and the Soviets, and Putin. I guess,
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:13.840]   you know, it's just in science, in particular medical science, it feels
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.000]   like this sort of unrealized potential, you know, the culture is so beautiful,
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.560]   the people are so smart and well-educated.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.960]   I think the word unrealized potential is kind of how I feel. That's why I wanted
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.000]   to celebrate that part of the world, is there's so
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.240]   many beautiful people, so many brilliant people. And I just
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.400]   happen to know the language, so I'm able to appreciate the beauty of those people.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:40.000]   I'm sure the same is true in China. I'm sure that that's one of the things that
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.040]   makes me sad, is there's all these cultures that I don't know about, I can't
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.600]   fully appreciate their brilliance. Even Japan
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.960]   and places like that, there are sort of, there's
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.200]   channels of communication wide open, and there's a lot of interaction. It's still
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.560]   not knowing the language, I feel like I miss some of the culture.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:04.320]   Or Portuguese, and you know, looking at South America, and all that kind of stuff.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.000]   But anyway, in Russia there certainly is that unrealized potential. In Ukraine,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.400]   so many brilliant scientists, engineers came from Ukraine, from Russia,
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:21.840]   and I hope they get to flourish soon. And I hope we put this,
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:27.520]   I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:34.160]   Is there something to comment about the biology of war?
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:39.920]   Is there echoes of the emergency room experience?
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:48.240]   Have you dealt with patients that have been touched by wartime?
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:54.800]   Definitely, war and medicine has a very intricate and complex relationship.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.240]   I don't know if it was Walt Whitman who said it, though he was a nurse during the
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.600]   Civil War, that war is the best medical school. But
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.240]   some people have said that. And you know, even advancements in
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.520]   medicine come from war. You know, the wars in
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.200]   Iraq and Afghanistan have, in some ways, really revolutionized
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.800]   certain aspects of the way we treat trauma patients in the civilian world as
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.160]   well. The importance of tourniquets, the
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.720]   importance of transfusing whole blood instead of,
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.880]   you know, red blood cells isolated from serum and platelets, etc.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.400]   The importance of pain control in the battlefield, that's changed dramatically.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.760]   Everything from ketamine injections to fentanyl lollipops
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.120]   in the battlefield. So war has really improved medicine in many ways.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.520]   In another way, you know, the Department of Defense spends a lot of money on
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.560]   medical research and kind of really pushes the envelope. You
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.880]   know, DARPA is one aspect of the military budget that really funds
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.640]   these moonshot experiments that are really fascinating and
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.920]   really push the frontiers more than seemingly most, you know, kind of
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.200]   universities doing it, doctors and researchers doing their
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.800]   research. So in a way, you know, the space program,
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:10.320]   which sort of was military initially, then became civilian under NASA,
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.080]   also led to a lot of advances and understandings of
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:19.760]   health, you know, on Earth and in space. So the military is, or war in general, is
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:23.440]   a huge way that medicine advances, not to mention
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.360]   the epidemics that come. You know, my grandmother was from what's
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:31.760]   today Moldova, what was then Romania. She got typhus during the
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.520]   World War II. So there's typhus outbreaks, there's cholera outbreaks, you
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.040]   know, all these, even infectious disease things can
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.560]   advance in war, which you wouldn't expect. You expect sort of trauma to be the
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.840]   sort of main problem, but actually infection is a huge problem
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.200]   throughout history and war. So we can learn a lot. It's this
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.960]   kind of horrific natural experiment in medical
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.760]   care. -Yeah, and I've recently been reading about some of the horrific
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.800]   medical experiments performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.120]   I'll talk about it another time perhaps, but
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.560]   nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:17.520]   war. Just to stay on your wild journeys for a little bit longer,
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.760]   you have a tweet about Shackleton saying, "Here's a photo of Shackleton's medical
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.560]   kit from his storied expedition to Antarctica
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:31.840]   in the 1910s. Some paragoric for pain, some laxatives,
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.960]   only the essentials." Would you put laxative under the essentials?
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.040]   Anyway, sorry to interrupt. When I worked as a
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:47.040]   ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018, I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:52.720]   EKG machine. So if you can comment sort of on that
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:55.600]   contrast, first of all, your own journey, how
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.680]   harsh was it, how difficult was it, and given that context,
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.240]   can you think about how hard Shackleton's journey was?
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.600]   -I think the difference is unimaginably stark.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.680]   One thing I do want to point out is that the use of laxatives early in the 20th
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:17.760]   century and before that, they were used for a surprising
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.040]   number of ailments where they probably did not help at all.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   But I think that was a holdover from sort of the old theory of medicine, the
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.240]   humoral theory, where you have to balance the fluids in the
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.720]   body. And so causing people to vomit, causing them to have diarrhea, or
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.920]   purposely taking blood out of them in bloodletting
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.440]   was a big part. And I think that crazy use of laxatives was
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:43.600]   maybe a holdover from that time. But that being said,
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.520]   they were probably not eating very high fiber food on that expedition, so perhaps
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.240]   laxatives could have been helpful. You know, there's a lot of seal,
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.800]   penguin and seal meat being eaten, which is not super high in fiber.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.240]   So I don't want to discount the importance of laxatives in that setting.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:04.000]   -But that wouldn't be the essential thing if you're thinking of a
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.560]   tiny kit that has only the essentials. I mean, pain,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.840]   yes, laxatives, maybe not. -I think the medical kit possibilities were
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.040]   much narrower back then. You know, this was
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.160]   before antibiotics, before, I think, germ theory might have been,
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:25.360]   you know, it was known, but there wasn't much to do about it.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:29.200]   So the availability of medicines, I mean, that's something that exploded over the
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.360]   course of the 20th century. So what I can put in a backpack today, filled
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:37.200]   with modern medications, whether injectable or to be taken orally, is
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.840]   just many orders of magnitude greater than what they had back then.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.480]   So when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton's. I
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.520]   was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:55.600]   who came with their own translators. And
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.280]   as I said, I had a cabinet, not just one cabinet, many cabinets full of
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.640]   medications, both injectable, some patches, some pills.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:07.920]   I was very impressed, actually, with what was available there.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.080]   And I didn't have to use a lot of it, thankfully, though I did use some of it
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.880]   for people. But, and I slept and, you know, I got
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.040]   free room and board on the ship. So every southern summer,
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.640]   cruise ships go take people to Antarctica, the
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.120]   southern Atlantic islands, like the Falklands and other
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.360]   parts of the South Pacific. And then in the northern summer, the same kind of
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.400]   cruise ship explosion happens, you know, going to
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.000]   Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard and Franz Josef Land and
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.480]   other parts of the North Alaska. So, and every ship needs a doctor.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.040]   So it's a great opportunity. They want specifically ER doctors, you know, to deal
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.200]   with emergencies. But you're really working in the middle
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.120]   of nowhere, and all you have is the medications there on the ship and
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.240]   supplies and your knowledge and experience. And so it's
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.840]   it's a very different experience than working in a high-tech modern hospital
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:06.000]   with every bit of technology and every subspecialist consultant available.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.280]   But I sort of like that challenge. I mean, I like going to the ends of the
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.960]   earth. It's beautiful, it's exciting, it's
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.560]   fascinating. Practicing medicine in those settings is
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.160]   extra challenging and really makes you hone some of your
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:22.320]   skills, which is part of the reason that I sought them out.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:26.240]   Do you see echoes of some of that same effort? I've gotten a chance to interact
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.320]   with astronauts and those kinds of folks working on space
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.200]   missions. Do you see some of those same echoes of challenging efforts going out
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.080]   into space and maybe landing on Mars and maybe
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.960]   beginning to build a small colony on Mars? Yeah, I think the
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.600]   health care that is needed will be a big part of that.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.760]   You know, obviously we're probably going to send overall quite healthy people,
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:52.880]   but there's a lot of medical decisions to make about what should be brought,
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.640]   what should be expected. You know, to some extent, I've had a lot of
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.960]   doctors say, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe you work in the middle of
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.200]   nowhere. What do you do if someone, you know,
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.800]   gets a brain bleed, like falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?" I mean, the
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.000]   obvious answer is they die. You know, when you're in
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.600]   the middle of Antarctica, things kill you that wouldn't if you're
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:14.800]   inside a university hospital that's fully equipped to help with
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.640]   every problem that arises. Mars takes that to a crazy extreme,
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:22.080]   obviously. I know that even going to Antarctica,
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.160]   different countries have had different strategies. I believe it was Australia
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.280]   used to kind of just in anticipation remove people's gallbladders
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.400]   just so that it wouldn't get inflamed, because that is a
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.000]   very common medical emergency. So they would just remove it beforehand, even
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.800]   though it was not diseased at all, just so that while they're stuck in
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.720]   Antarctica over the winter, for instance, that wouldn't be a problem. You know,
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.600]   there's many other issues that can arise. But so those are some decisions to make.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:52.400]   Maybe the people who go into Mars should have their appendix removed, their
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.120]   gallbladder removed. Maybe they should have a cardiac cath
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:58.000]   to see if they have coronary artery disease, just to know their chances of
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.560]   getting a heart attack there, though it's not always predictive.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.760]   You know, it's hard to predict who's going to get a heart attack, but maybe
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:06.800]   with all the data around today, we'll get, you know, better at predicting. But that
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:09.120]   will be a huge part. You know, we can't have people,
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.960]   the few pioneers in a Mars colony dying of heart attacks and things like that.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.000]   Anticipate stuff. Would you go, you've gone to some harsh conditions to be a
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.640]   doctor. Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:25.920]   It would definitely be amazing, I think, because I have a wife and two small
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:28.320]   children, probably not in the cards for me at this
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:32.320]   point. But you humans with your human
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:35.760]   attachments. Sex and death.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.800]   If you just put more priority on the death than the sex, I think we would be
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.600]   better off. No. I would love to go to Mars. And actually,
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.440]   you know, I practice high altitude medicine in Nepal. Space medicine is sort
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.440]   of an extension of that. You know, the air is just
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.800]   much thinner, like non-existent. You know, as you go higher in the mountains,
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.240]   the things that happen to human physiology are very bizarre and
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.840]   strange and still not well explained by science.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:07.120]   And in space, it's just like a crazy extension of high altitude.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.680]   If I could just return to the, we didn't really, I think we mentioned a little bit
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.520]   about the food you had. Just, if we could, high level, say,
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.880]   what is the greatest meal you've ever had? So, your last meal. Let's go.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.920]   If one more meal, I get to murder you after this,
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:29.520]   this is your last day. We get to spend it together. Where in the world would you go?
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:34.560]   What would you eat? I would say the most delicious thing
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:39.200]   is bone marrow. And I would love a full meal of bone marrow for my last
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:45.440]   last dish. I did, on my birthday in 2002, eat a kilogram and a half of crab meat
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:50.160]   in Kamchatka. And that was also amazingly delicious.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.680]   The king crab they have there is incredible. But
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.440]   I would go with bone marrow, which is, I think, just one of the most delicious
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.680]   foods. And it's sort of this weird body part.
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.200]   You know, it's basically all your stem cells, not all of them, but the stem cells
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.600]   that produce all your blood cells. So, they
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.720]   are spitting out billions of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.200]   every day. And there's a bunch of fat in there as
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.120]   well. Just one of the places the body stores fat. And so,
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:18.640]   you basically add heat and that's all you need. It's like the perfect food.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.080]   You add heat, the fat for frying the stem cells is already there.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:25.440]   There's a bone, naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.040]   Probably add some flavor too. It's like the perfect food.
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.880]   Does it matter which animal? I prefer a larger animal, just so
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.400]   there's more of it. I actually like, oh that's true, I actually really like sort
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.480]   of bone marrow from like chicken bones. Right, just sucking it out of the bone.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.920]   Yes, I'm known for leaving absolutely nothing
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.440]   edible on the plate except bone itself. There's one
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:55.440]   other human I know that loves bone marrow as much as you do, and
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:00.320]   that's Joe Rogan. So, it's unnatural how much that man
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.680]   loves bone marrow. I understand why. I love the steak part.
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.560]   You know what, let me argue with you because,
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.160]   I don't know, it could be an acquired taste,
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:20.320]   but there's just too much, it's like too much with too little work for it.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.120]   Like it's as if you gave me lobster meat without the lobster
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:30.480]   having to clean the lobster. I just feel like I'm spoiling myself.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:35.200]   So, it's very fatty. I don't know, maybe I want to work for something that
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:38.320]   tastes like that. Well, if you start from the whole animal, you do have to work to
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:42.320]   get at it, right? A lot of animals have the teeth and the
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.960]   jaw muscles to chomp through bone. We do not.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.200]   So, you know, when you buy it from the store, it's already sawed up,
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.800]   but I've definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones, you know, with a hatchet.
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.400]   Just chop off the fat end and start spooning it out.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.920]   Or maybe I'll revisit it. That's fascinating. And where?
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.160]   Where would you eat it? Where in which place of the world?
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:10.560]   Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.480]   You're not allowed to pick your family.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:21.200]   So, like which place in the world, rural or in the city,
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.680]   those kinds of things. You've been to so many fascinating places.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.160]   I would say Antarctica is one of the most picturesque
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:34.800]   places I've ever been. I really did not. I didn't know how mountainous it was.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.440]   And I guess I knew there'd be ice, but just I didn't know how much ice it was.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:42.000]   You know, it's ice and mountains, just overwhelming.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000]   It just, you know, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow might seem to you,
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.600]   sort of that feast for your eyes. And just ice in general is amazing.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.200]   Like the icebergs floating around Antarctica is just astounding.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:59.440]   Like the different shapes, the sizes are incredible.
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.840]   There's actually a, I believe it's a U.S. Navy website that tracks the largest icebergs.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.400]   And you can read about each of them and how big they are.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.920]   And just the formations you see, similar up near Greenland,
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.480]   though I have not been to Greenland.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.160]   Just ice in general is just amazing. So I could just look at its different forms
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.200]   while eating bone marrow forever, until you kill me, that is.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.760]   Yeah. And afterwards we go. It's back to the death of the death and sex.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.600]   I, what is it about the ice? Is it sort of the enormity of nature?
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:35.040]   It just reminds you that it's going to be there before you and after.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.520]   And then you get to partake in the eating of the thing you need
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:44.160]   for maintaining of your biological, temporary biological organism.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:48.880]   Yeah, I think it's a few things. One is just the shapes that you see,
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:53.360]   you know, the wave action, just eating away at these pieces of ice.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.560]   You get these arches and just these shapes. I mean, it's just like...
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:57.360]   Geometry.
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:01.040]   The geometry alone is amazing. I studied math as an undergrad,
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:06.720]   and I've always appreciated geometry. And just the shapes alone are just,
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:11.680]   look like brilliant works of modernist art. And just obviously no two are ever the same.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:15.920]   Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.240]   that is just really startling and fascinating. The same color of glaciers,
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.280]   in various parts of the world, that blue color is just really amazing.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:28.960]   And I also just love how it's sort of this constant shedding
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:34.320]   from our Antarctic continent, from Greenland. It's this constant process of snow falling inland
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.640]   and pushing the glaciers further out to sea and then breaking loose. I mean,
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.120]   obviously it seems to be happening faster these days, but it's sort of this constant shedding.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:47.600]   I always like thinking about how the body has something similar. We're constantly shedding
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:54.720]   and renewing and rebuilding everything. And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:59:02.960]   Yeah. I did not know you were a math undergrad. So that, I mean, you just keep getting more
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:10.400]   fascinating. Can you maybe take a small step into that direction? What do you find beautiful
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.640]   about mathematics? Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:20.480]   I liked math. I especially liked, so college math, I did some calculus in high school.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:25.840]   When I got to college math, I was amazed that there were no more numbers. The digits
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:32.400]   disappeared. It was just variables, concepts. There was almost no more numbers at all. It was
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:40.080]   like this totally abstract kind of way of thinking, but that sort of reflects the natural world and
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:45.360]   teaches you about the natural world. Though it's sort of this perfect platonic ideal, perhaps,
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:50.160]   of the natural world that can still sort of help explain what happens in the natural world. But
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:57.840]   just these concepts are so abstract from life and from the natural world. I was actually getting
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:04.560]   interested in the natural world at the same time when I was at NYU studying math. I took a tour of
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:09.600]   Central Park that was pointing, the guy, Steve Brill, was pointing out these wild edible plants.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:14.640]   And I was learning to identify the first plants and knowing what's edible, what's not. That was
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:19.120]   totally fascinating. And sort of this kind of thing that I felt like was connecting me to nature.
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:25.520]   And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science, you know, or utterly abstract lessons
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:30.160]   I was getting in math class where I was thinking through series, you know, as we approach infinity,
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:35.440]   what happens to these equations and concepts of like rings and abstract algebra. I don't know,
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:40.000]   it was just this dichotomy that I enjoyed both aspects of.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:46.240]   Yeah, the concepts, but so different, this kind of logical,
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:55.840]   rigorous view of the world and the world of biology. How did that feel to take the leap into
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:04.640]   the biological, the mushy mess of the human body from the mathematical, which is all very clean?
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.600]   Right. It does feel like a big step. I think there's more connection than you think. You know,
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:15.920]   we talked about symmetry of the body earlier. That is a real thing. You know, fluid dynamics of how
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:21.280]   our various bodily fluids flow and what makes them not flow as well and what makes them flow better.
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.680]   And, you know, all these different aspects of science go into the body.
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:34.800]   You know, everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh to liquids of various consistencies.
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:40.320]   You know, a lot of science and math does teach you about kind of how the body works,
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:43.440]   how it can work better, what happens in sort of disease states.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:50.000]   Yeah, I suppose there's a connection. There's also kind of a
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.840]   sort of computational biologists, this computational equivalence of each of the
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:02.160]   disciplines, which are becoming more and more fascinating with all the work that DeepMind is
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.800]   doing and the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff, simulating different parts of the body
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:12.640]   to try to gain an intuition, understanding of it. That to me is super fascinating,
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:16.160]   but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification of the way the body really
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:24.880]   does it because the body is an incredibly weird, complex system. And it finds a way.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:30.800]   The adaptability, the resilience, the redundancy that's built in, it's weird.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:38.480]   And it's incredibly powerful and so unlike the kind of computer-based systems that we build,
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:42.800]   at least we engineer in the software engineering world, which kind of starts to make you think,
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.600]   how can we engineer computer systems in a different way that make them more resilient
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:54.720]   in the real world? That's sort of the robotics question. What do you think about that?
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:01.520]   What does it take to build a humanoid robot or robots that are as resilient as the human body?
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.760]   How difficult do you think is that problem? Having studied the human body,
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:12.560]   how hard is the engineering problem of building systems like that guy over there, the legged
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:18.080]   guy that is as resilient as the human body to the harsh conditions of the real world?
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:23.280]   I think it's very hard and we definitely haven't gotten there yet. I think we could probably learn
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:28.000]   lessons from people who are trying to grow artificial organs in the lab to eventually
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.560]   transplant into people, which would solve the huge problem of needing to get those organs
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:36.960]   from others and the rejection of putting a foreign material inside your body.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:43.360]   Your immune system tends not to like that. That has advanced a lot recently. I think
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.200]   some advances actually have been where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells, stem cells,
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.440]   stem cells. We can grow whatever we want out of stem cells, but now there's sort of a recognition
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:04:00.000]   that what we call the extracellular matrix, which is sort of the foundation of the body,
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.080]   the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape and keeps them where they should be,
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.760]   that is actually crucial. There's probably a lot of signaling that goes on. You stick a
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.800]   stem cell on the right extracellular matrix, it will turn into the kind of cell that you want and
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:21.120]   take the right shape and position and start functioning. I think that's been a huge advance,
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:26.400]   knowing that it's not just these celebrity stem cells that are the answer. It's this kind of
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.560]   part in the background, this sort of just like laying the foundation, the system that you put
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:36.080]   these cells onto. We're not there yet, but there's definitely a lot happening, a lot of research
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:42.320]   happening. I think there'll be some advances probably soon. - Now on the topic of interaction
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:50.880]   of computational systems with biology. If you look at a company like Neuralink or the whole effort of
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:57.680]   brain-computer interfaces, now there's a neurosurgery component there. We have to connect
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:07.600]   electrical systems with biological systems. So just even the implanting is difficult,
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:13.440]   then the communication is difficult. But what would you say, from what you know about the brain,
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:19.040]   what you know about the human body and all the beautiful mess that's there, how difficult is
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:24.880]   the effort of Neuralink? Do you think it's feasible? - I think it's definitely feasible. I
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:31.920]   think we need to probably know more than we do and know how to connect it in all these ways. I think
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:38.560]   some advances, for instance, much less sexy, but really already impacting medical care is something
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.400]   called deep brain stimulation, which is done for Parkinson's disease and others, where
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.000]   neurosurgeons implant this device that electrically stimulates the part of the brain
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.600]   that is not functioning in Parkinson's disease. And it's quite dramatic how effective it works.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:59.040]   And I remember as a med student watching a neurologist literally turn the electricity up
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.280]   on this handheld thing, and you could see the person's Parkinson tremor go away, and you could
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:10.480]   see them start to walk in a more steady fashion. And I know there's actually studies, or there may
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:16.480]   be studies in the future studying the same deep brain stimulation for everything from eating
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:23.120]   disorders to severe OCD, like paralyzing OCD, not just like, "I want to wash my hands three times."
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:32.080]   But, and so I think the, you know, the potential is there, but I guess connecting the brain in a
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.560]   microscopic way, in sort of a multifaceted way, you know, there needs to be sort of a million
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:41.280]   connections or some very high number of connections for them to work fluidly, as far as I know. I'm
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:46.720]   not an expert in the area. - First of all, I believe and I trust in the adaptability of the
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:52.640]   biological system to whatever crazy stuff you try to shove in there. So it's going to potentially
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:59.200]   reject things, but it's also going to, if it doesn't reject things, adapt. And if we can create
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:06.320]   computational systems that also adapt, AI systems that adapt, and can kind of, both of them reach
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:11.120]   towards each other and figure stuff out. But actually, our current AI systems are not very
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:18.800]   adaptable to the, like, in the wild way that biology is adaptable, like adaptable to anything.
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:23.840]   And if we can build AI systems like that, I feel like there's some interesting things you could do.
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:31.840]   But of course there's ethics and there's real human lives at stake. And there you can't quite
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:37.440]   experiment. You have to have things that work and maybe simulation can help, but reality is,
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:44.640]   it's a dangerous playground to play on. - It is messy.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:49.680]   - You tweeted that quote, "If you look back from far enough into the future,
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:52.560]   every doctor today will look like a total quack."
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:02.800]   First of all, that's humbling to think about. Like, we don't know what we're doing in the great,
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:08.640]   like, there's been so much progress that we kind of have this confidence that we figured it all out.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:14.240]   If you look at history and you read how people thought, I mean, there's so many moments in
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.360]   history where people really thought that they figured it all out. It's almost like there's
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:27.280]   nothing else left to do at every stage in history. And then you realize, no, progress often happens
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:32.880]   like exponentially. And every moment you continue to think you figured it all out.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.880]   But if you're being honest, if you're being humble, then you realize we're just shrouded in
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:43.840]   mystery. So what do we make of this? Like, how should we feel that? How should you feel as a
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:51.120]   doctor? How should we feel as scientific explorers of the human body? The fact that we're probably
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:55.920]   going to be wrong about everything we currently know. - Right. There's a saying, actually,
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:02.400]   by the time you finish med school, half of what you learned is wrong, which is quite illustrative.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:07.200]   And becoming more true as time goes on, you know, so much medical research going on,
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.640]   so much learning going on, it's really wonderful in a way. But in some ways, we still learn these
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:18.000]   concepts, you know, from the past. And I know when you take a test as a medical student, sometimes
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:23.520]   you know they want you to give the old answer, but you know there's a new answer because of
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.680]   recent science, but you know to give the old answer that's now incorrect to get the question
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:31.760]   right on the test. That happens actually quite a bit because things change so quickly.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:38.400]   - Yeah, you know, when I look back at doctors from centuries past, I mean, it's absurd what they were
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.720]   doing to their patients. I mean, probably for most of human history, they were doing more harm than
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:47.600]   good. You know, they're draining people of their blood. That was, you know, bloodletting was a
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:55.120]   huge part of medical care. You know, George Washington died of a paratonsillar abscess,
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:10:00.160]   an abscess right next to the tonsil, which has the great name of Quincy, and they bled him to death,
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:06.160]   you know, I mean, kind of adding insult to injury. Doctors are a menace and do a lot of harm. I mean,
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:10.640]   hopefully not intentionally. You know, even medical errors are still a huge problem,
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.880]   cause of death and morbidity. So we do a lot of things that are not great, but you know,
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:21.920]   our knowledge, yeah, it's very imperfect at this point. I do have some confidence. You know, I guess
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:29.840]   perfect scientific studies that try to get at the reality of the universe are essential because when
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:35.440]   I think of why a certain medication works for a certain condition, it might make perfect sense
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:40.640]   in my head, knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy. It makes perfect sense. It must work.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.000]   I gave it to the patient, they got better, and that's happened 20 times in the last year.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.360]   But it's, you know, I'm wrong. Like, when you actually do a study, it actually doesn't help.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:56.880]   Maybe it hurts. And that's really, I think the way we explain medications working in our minds
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:02.960]   is often wrong when you end up finally doing the study. And some of the most interesting experiments
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:08.320]   involve what we call sham surgery. So for instance, people who injure their knee,
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:11.760]   you know, arthroscopy, where an orthopedic surgeon goes in there with a scope,
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.880]   gets bits of bone out, shaves down the cartilage, you know, cleans things up,
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.680]   and it helps some people. But they actually did some studies where one group of people got the
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.800]   true arthroscopy and others just got sham surgery, where they put them to sleep, made little cuts in
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.240]   the skin so they woke up with scars, and then it turned out that it's not clear arthroscopy's
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:39.520]   actually helping. And the same, there was a recent huge study of doing, putting a stent in someone's
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:43.520]   coronary arteries if they have stable chest pain. Not like, I'm having a heart attack, you need a
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:48.480]   stent, like, right then. But, you know, kind of chronic coronary artery disease where every time
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.680]   I run up the stairs I get chest pain, and then when I rest it goes away. Like, obviously, you
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.000]   put a stent, you increase blood flow to the heart, like, how could that not work? But then when they
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.600]   did the sham catheterization, it actually looks like it might not actually help better than the
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.280]   sham. So I think those placebo-controlled studies are essential. I mean, it is shocking, and this
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:14.080]   has been driven home during the last two years, how hard it is to figure out what the hell's going
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.960]   on in the universe, and especially with our bodies. Like, it is really hard to get at the truth, and
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:23.680]   what you think makes sense, like, often turns out, I mean, the history of modern medicine is littered
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:28.400]   with examples where it made perfect sense and it seemed to help some patients, and it turns out
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.880]   it's not doing anything, or it's harmful. - Yeah, there's all kinds of narratives swimming
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.160]   around. We convince ourselves as a human civilization that something is true. There's
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:46.000]   propaganda machines, there's just self-delusion, there's centralized communities, like, there's a
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.600]   scientific community that believes a certain thing, there's the conspiracy theories that believe a
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:55.600]   certain thing. Sometimes the scientific community are right, sometimes the conspiracy theorists are
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:00.960]   right, throughout human history, I mean. And we now think the scientific community, well, now
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:05.120]   the science has really figured it out, we're way smarter than we were in the past. And then there's
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:12.800]   these, like, interesting studies that I've seen, I think Robin Hanson mentioned it to me, that if
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:19.680]   you look at the entirety of medication, like, the effect of medication on human health, if you do
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:27.520]   those kinds of broad studies, does it actually help? Like, does quality of life, lifespan,
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:33.280]   certain measures of the well-being, does, and you look at human society as a whole,
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.840]   does taking medication or not actually help? And those studies find there's no positive or
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:46.880]   negative effect with medication. And that's a very kind of interesting perspective, I mean,
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:55.040]   you could probably argue a lot of ways, but the point is, 'cause you can bring up
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.280]   literally a billion cases where medication has significant positive impact on a particular
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:06.960]   patient, but you have to kind of zoom out and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine,
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:13.600]   of lifestyle choices, diet choices, of exercise or not, you know, maybe we'll find eventually
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:20.000]   that exercise is actually bad for you. (laughs) But maybe, like, there's all kinds of things that
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.520]   we're going to, I feel like we're going to figure out. One of the things I think we're going to
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:34.480]   figure out, everything I've learned about my body, is that aside from it being adaptable,
[02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:40.080]   there's a lot of very unique parameters that are opaque to me that I'm measuring through this
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:46.480]   feedback mechanism by trying stuff and learning about it. And one of the things we might learn
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:53.200]   is that medicine cannot be done without collecting a huge amount of data about each individual human.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:15:00.640]   So like, it's absurd to be, like, if I show up and see a doctor, it's absurd for that doctor to
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:08.720]   have just a couple of minutes with me. Like, just, like, looking at basic symptoms, looking at such,
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:18.880]   like, crappy data. Like, first of all, no long-term data, no longitudinal data,
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:26.960]   no historical data, no detailed analysis of all the possible things, not just the related to your
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:32.240]   symptoms, but related to other things that you're not complaining about. Just giving you a full
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:38.640]   picture of the data, and then using AI to help the human doctor highlight the things that you should
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:44.800]   perhaps pay extra attention to. I think we'll look back at this time as ridiculous that doctors
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:50.480]   were expected to help anybody whatsoever without having the data, without having a huge amount of
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:56.400]   data about the human body. Like, you have to do so much with so little data. - It's very 19th
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.360]   century. - It's very 19th century. So it relies on the brilliance of doctors, and of course,
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:07.280]   the intuition, the instinct you build up over time. And that's quite powerful. The human brain
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:12.560]   is pretty damn good for using experience to teach you how to make good decisions, but still,
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:22.000]   you might as well be bloodletting. Like, it's humbling to think about that. It's humbling.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.880]   - It is humbling, and it's important. I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:34.000]   on what they do, and I think it's very important, because as I said, medical history is just,
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.120]   medical dogma has been tossed into the trash bin so many times. Something doctors were sure of
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:48.800]   was the case is not, and it's important to be cognizant of that. - You tweeted about somebody
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:57.040]   that had a big impact, just by reading about him, on my life as well. I still think about him.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:04.320]   Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer. A big inspiration to me. His medical career was a testament to what
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:11.200]   one person can do to improve the world. So, who was Paul Farmer, and what made him a great doctor
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:18.080]   and a great man, and somebody who was an inspiration to you? - So, Paul Farmer was a kind
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:24.880]   of pioneer of global health. He started Partners in Health, which is kind of an international health
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:32.640]   organization that operates originally in Haiti, also Rwanda and elsewhere. And I think he was just
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:39.920]   so a zealot for getting healthcare to some of the poorest people in the world. And he, I remember
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:44.400]   reading some of his books, and a book about him by Tracy Kidder that's really great, Mountains
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:49.040]   Beyond Mountains, about how even when he was a medical student, he was flying back and forth to
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:56.960]   Haiti in between exams, and just with this really intense focus and interest in getting healthcare
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:03.440]   to where it's not. And I think traveling around the world, especially to poorer places like India,
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:09.440]   Calcutta, Nepal, you really see how unevenly the benefits of modern medicine are spread over the
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.440]   surface of the earth. Not only if you're, because if you're in Antarctica and have a heart attack,
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:21.600]   you're in serious trouble, but just medications that cost pennies a day can help people. A lot
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.760]   of children in India under five die of diarrhea, and all they need is oral rehydration solutions to
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:33.840]   stay hydrated. Most of them can't afford IV fluids, for instance, to get admitted to the hospital. And
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:38.240]   really, dehydration just kills hundreds of thousands of kids throughout the world,
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.560]   not to mention bacterial pneumonia also is a major cause of death in children under five,
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:48.960]   and many of them, not all, would be saved by amoxicillin, which is just pennies.
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:56.320]   And for me, you know, I took a, had a path, and I wanted to have a career in global health,
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:00.320]   and I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere when I was a medical student, and I
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.280]   continued doing that. Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first to kind of open everyone's eyes,
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:11.680]   I think, about the good you can do with just money that we would, you know, change that we would
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:16.000]   throw away, just, you know, put in a purse and forget it, or wherever we accumulate change these
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.680]   days. So that's very eye-opening. And while medical science advances, and that's good, you
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:25.760]   know, we shouldn't forget that hundred-year-old treatments could save lives in parts of the world
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.360]   where they're just not available. - People should definitely read "Mountains Beyond Mountains."
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:38.560]   Just, for me at least, sort of a person from outside all of it, it was the first person to
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:45.120]   make me realize how difficult, and the amount of humanity that's involved in being a doctor.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:52.160]   So it's not some kind of cold, economics-based argument about where to send treatments and so on.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:59.280]   That is there, too. Like you said, basic treatments can help hundreds of thousands,
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.600]   millions of people in many parts of the world. But it's also,
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:11.680]   when you have a patient in front of you, there's some aspect of you that's willing to give a lot
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:17.760]   of your time, a lot of your money, a lot of your effort to saving them, even though it doesn't
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:24.720]   make any sense. It's irrational in some sense, but it's also human. And that's the struggle of
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.200]   every doctor, when you have to choose how to allocate your time, how to allocate your mental
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:36.880]   energy. It's a tough choice that a doctor has to make, and it's a human choice. It's not some kind
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:43.360]   of cold, game-theoretic choice. It's also a human choice, and it can be irrational in some sense.
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:48.160]   - Right, people are asking you for help. That's basically what every patient interaction is.
[02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:53.280]   Someone's asking you for help, so your inclination is to help them. And even if it means going above
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:59.600]   and beyond, I mean, a lot of factors affect how compassionate a doctor might be on any given day
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:06.160]   or point in their career, their own stress and burnout, et cetera. But it's someone asking you
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:15.120]   for help, and so you do what you can to help them. - You've done quite a lot of things in your life.
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:20.320]   It's been an interesting journey. Of course, there's a lot of story yet to be written.
[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:28.160]   But what advice would you give to young people today in high school, maybe undergrad, college,
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:35.520]   starting out on that journey? Maybe trying to pick majors, trying to pick jobs, careers,
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:40.960]   dreams, and goals they can pursue. What advice would you give them to have a career they can
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:48.400]   be proud of or to even have a life they can be proud of? - Well, I think having passion, which
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:53.760]   isn't always a voluntary thing, you just have it or you don't, perhaps, but becoming passionate
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:58.800]   about something and following it, wherever it takes you, I think is really important.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:04.880]   When I finished college and sort of went to Russia for the first time, that was, in some ways,
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:11.520]   the beginning of my whole career and passions in my life. And I didn't know what I was going for,
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:14.960]   what was gonna happen, what kind of career it would turn into, what kind of job would it help
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.040]   me get when I got back. I wasn't thinking about anything like that. I'm very fortunate I got that
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:25.600]   opportunity. I was very fortunate to be able to go and see those places and have my mind opened.
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:30.880]   And I think that really just the fuel from that passion that was created during that time is still
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:37.280]   20 years later going strong. I'm partial to healthcare. I love being a doctor. I think it's
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:43.280]   the perfect combination of kind of intellectual problem-solving, being a detective while also
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:47.760]   working with your hands when you do procedures, especially in the ER. It's sort of the perfect
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:56.000]   combination. I'm not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit for a variety of reasons. And so
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.560]   I always loved working with my hands. I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts,
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:07.360]   before medical school. And I just love kind of problem-solving, getting clues, figuring out
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:13.200]   what's going on, following your nose, using your instincts, your knowledge, and also just keen
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:18.320]   observation of the patient. After seeing patient after patient, hundreds of patients, maybe thousands
[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:24.080]   over years, you do get this sort of innate kind of sense, this gestalt about what might be going on.
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:30.400]   And it's not always a numbers thing. That's the thing. Gestalt is actually a big part of medicine.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:36.560]   You often in ERs or in hospitals hear a nurse or a doctor say something like, "This patient just
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:41.920]   doesn't look good." And it's sort of, you can't point to a number, a value, a level in their blood,
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:47.920]   you know, a test, but something about them. And a lot of that I think has to do with the color
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:53.760]   of their skin, believe it or not, which can change in certain disease states. But I think that
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:24:01.680]   it's just medicine combines this observation, the skills, the knowledge, it's art and science,
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:07.600]   it's human and it's robotic, you know, algorithmic at the same time. And I think it just,
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:13.280]   yeah, combines kind of all my passions all in one. And I would, you know, if anyone's going
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.240]   into healthcare, I'd strongly encourage them to do so, but I'm very biased.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:21.600]   So with that early passion, whatever that little flame was that brought you to Russia,
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:28.400]   were you able to vocalize it or was it just something like a gut that pulled you towards some
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:32.240]   exploration of the unknown or something like this?
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.120]   I think it was a combination of things. One was just going to a different place that was
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:42.080]   different from where I grew up, you know. The suburbs, you know, when you're in high school,
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:46.080]   you hate them. Later on, they don't seem so bad. But, you know, I just wanted to get, I mean,
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:52.320]   I'm very fortunate how I was raised and never wanted for anything that wasn't rich. But just
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:57.120]   to get out and see a different place, a different people with a different culture and history and
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:01.520]   language and literature and to see different climates and geographies and ecosystems, I just
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:06.720]   wanted to see something different. And that, I guess that's what I've, you know, sought after
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:12.800]   ever since. So just that was just so fascinating. Like my trip to Kamchatka in 2003, where I was
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:18.640]   there for four months, and I didn't speak English for, I think, two months out of it. And just,
[02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.880]   I remember lying on the floor, some wooden floor in a hunter's cabin in the middle of northern
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:28.800]   Kamchatka, just being like, "What am I doing here?" I was just so grateful for the experiences I was
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:33.680]   having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning. I was just so grateful, even though
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:37.920]   I was lying on this hard, uncomfortable floor. It was just like, "This is so amazing." And that,
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.960]   I don't think I'll ever have another travel as meaningful and life-changing as that particular
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:49.280]   trip to Kamchatka was, though I'm still striving after it. You know, you never replicate that first
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.920]   high, but you always try. So I just think that seeing something different is kind of the game.
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.280]   And there wasn't really a plan. Because I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently,
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:10.800]   and his advice is, "Always have a plan." And it sounds like you're saying,
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:18.560]   "Don't have a plan. Don't need to have a plan. Just listen to your gut, your passion,
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:22.560]   and follow that and see where that takes you." Because it's telling you something.
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:28.000]   Yeah, I think, you know, I guess the plan could be specific or could be as general as,
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.360]   "I just want to go far away and see something very different. That's my plan."
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.440]   That's one line.
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:37.520]   Yeah, just followed my nose from one thing to the next, just being interested,
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:40.720]   following my passion. And again, very fortunate I could do that.
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:48.800]   Are there places in the world you're kind of thinking about that your life might take you at
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:58.160]   some point to be a doctor there for a time, to explore for a time that you haven't yet?
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:03.280]   You know, I have some colleagues who do kind of global health work in various countries in Africa
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:10.560]   and Central and South America. I would really love to go to some of those places, not just for a
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:16.160]   short trip, but hopefully for an extended period of time with sort of the healthcare being the
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:22.160]   ticket in, but then maybe even bringing my children or just, you know, I guess at this point, some of
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.400]   the travel I dream about is sort of replicating what I did and showing it to my kids in a way.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:32.080]   But there's still a lot I haven't seen and would love to see as well. But I think those
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.600]   opportunities sort of lend themselves well, you know, as a doctor with kind of the ability to go
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:42.960]   there and sort of help patients, but also teach medical students and residents. Teaching is
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:47.760]   actually a huge part of being a doctor that's underappreciated, but that's actually part of
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:52.000]   the fun of being a doctor is that you're also a teacher. Of course, the word doctor means teacher,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:59.200]   but it's come to mean something else. But, you know, in some of my jobs, I'm working alongside
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.680]   medical students and residents, and I'm giving them my knowledge, my wisdom, sharing with them
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:12.080]   stories. And so that's a very satisfying part of the job. - If we could take a brief step into a
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:22.080]   dark place together for a time, is there, what is a dark place you've gone in your mind, in your life?
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:29.680]   What would be the darkest place you've ever gone for a time, for a moment?
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:39.760]   And how did you survive? How did you overcome it? - That's a very good question. I would say
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:49.440]   I haven't had as dark moments as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:56.000]   I'm fortunate in that way. I've had a pretty, you know, enjoyable, satisfying life. You know,
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:02.080]   I think everybody has dark moments, though, including me. One of the most shocking things,
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:07.840]   I feel like, becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been, one, no one knows what
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:14.240]   they're doing, and two, suicide is incredibly common, like, in all humans, in all societies.
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:18.560]   That I just find shocking. I mean, I've never seriously contemplated it myself, but
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:24.080]   I wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind during some more stressful times of life.
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:30.560]   I think it crosses everyone's mind, and it sort of, as a kid, I found that I never would have
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:37.920]   guessed how common suicide is. - It's an important question to sort of the Camus question, like,
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:45.040]   why live? Why? Why? 'Cause, like, life, especially when you're struggling,
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:52.400]   especially when life is shit, like, why am I doing any of this? And then, on top of that,
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:30:01.040]   chemistry of your brain, it could be as simple as diet and nutrition and aforementioned exercise
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:06.640]   and things like this that affect the chemistry, such that you're more predisposed to go to the
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:14.800]   places of asking the question why, and maybe struggling to find a good answer. 'Cause it's
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:22.000]   actually a question with no good answer, except something in your chemistry says, "Well, I kinda
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:28.560]   like it," but there's no good intellectual answer. And especially if day-to-day it's pain.
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:36.000]   You get to see these stories of, you know, Robin Williams, these people that are on top of the
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:43.920]   world from an external perspective, but from an internal perspective, it's struggle. Every day is
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:52.080]   pain. It feels hopeless. And yeah, that's a question we all have to struggle with, or learn
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:57.120]   how to ignore. Maybe because if you ask the question too much, you're not gonna, you're not
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:31:01.680]   going to find a good answer. That's a choice you make. I personally think you should ask that
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:10.000]   question a lot. But maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have where I'm not in danger
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.960]   of seriously contemplating suicide. But why live is an important question to
[02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:19.600]   answer constantly, and struggle to answer that constantly.
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:29.680]   But people, I've been extremely fortunate to meet people over the past couple of years that are
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:41.680]   really struggling. And you have probably met people who are really struggling, like orders
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:47.440]   of magnitude more people who are really struggling. Some of it is psychological, a lot of it is
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:54.000]   biological. And man, life is a motherfucker. It's pretty tough.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:32:01.040]   Very true. I do think also past trauma plays a big role there. Like we talked about, you know,
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:07.440]   war wounds and PTSD. And a lot of people grew up, I mean, with just horrific childhoods. They were
[02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:13.280]   abused in one way or another. And I think a lot of people who have, not a majority, I'm not saying a
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:19.280]   majority, but a lot of people, for instance, who I see in the ER coming in for threatening suicide,
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:22.960]   or actually trying and failing and being brought to the ER, you know, a lot of them just have
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:30.000]   really traumatic experiences. You know, saw their parent commit suicide, were abused. You know,
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.320]   these leave scars in the human brain and mind. And a lot of their subsequent lives of,
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:40.560]   whether it's substance abuse, alcoholism, etc., is almost trying to escape from their own memories.
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:48.000]   It's sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes. Like sometimes people get ruined,
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:53.040]   it seems, and just can't be fixed. You know what I mean? Yes, you can improve diet and health,
[02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:58.960]   and your life choices, and seek out your passion and exercise, and those definitely will help.
[02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:02.960]   But sometimes just like, you know, you bear the scars of the past and there's no getting rid of
[02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:09.760]   them. - Yeah. I think it's possible to live with them. - I think so too. - Because of the struggle.
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:14.480]   - I would never say give up, you know. - Keep fighting. - It is a constant,
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:19.600]   it can be a constant battle for some people. - I know it can be, and I've talked to many of
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:26.960]   those folks. I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight. - Hopelessness is kind
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:32.240]   of one of the big suicide risk factors that you sort of ask about as a doctor, you know,
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:39.840]   do you feel hopeless? And that sort of can be a harbinger. - I have quite a few dark moments, so
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:47.360]   if you're listening and you're struggling, we're in this together, brother and sister.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:55.920]   Keep up the good fight. - Life is a motherfucker, as you said. It's really harder, I think as a kid,
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:00.320]   you know, in a joy-free childhood, you don't realize, like, obviously there's a ton you don't
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:05.520]   realize about life, but then when you get to be an adult, you realize just how complex and
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:13.680]   hard it is. Is it this hard for adult animals? I don't know. I don't think it is. - So I haven't
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:24.560]   seen the honesty of biology before you. Do you think about your own death? Do you contemplate
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:30.880]   death? Are you afraid of your own death? How do you make sense of it? - I've definitely thought
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:36.880]   about it, especially maybe while doing certain risky things, ice climbing and others, where
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:44.400]   every time I look down, I thought about my own death. But I think having kids changes the equation
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:52.080]   for sure, should change the equation perhaps. So I think a lot of now when I think about what will
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:58.800]   happen when I die, there's a lot of worrying about what will happen to the people I care for. You
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:05.200]   think about things like insurance policy, life insurance, and disability insurance, that's not
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:11.920]   related to death, but more just injuries. And that's part of the weight, I guess, that you feel
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:18.240]   as an adult that I think grows rapidly when you have kids. Though not only, there's other people
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:23.600]   you can care for, your own parents and loved ones. A lot of people depend on individuals,
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:29.280]   and so you think about what will happen to the other people when you die. - But also, to push
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:35.760]   back, that weight might be something you've convinced yourself to think about, it's an
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:43.840]   important way to think about, but you focus on that weight to escape the other weight, which is,
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:53.840]   at one point, this consciousness just comes to an end. And it's hard to make sense of that.
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:58.800]   We kind of delude ourselves in thinking, okay, it just, yeah, it ends, that's the natural way
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:04.880]   of things and so on, that makes sense, or okay, that's the way of life. But I don't think it's
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:17.680]   cognitively easy to just realize how terrifying that is. We love life so much that the end of it,
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:26.800]   it just, it's something that makes no sense. And if you linger on that thought, I think it's a
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:34.640]   painful, I would say even terrifying thought. Not scared of like, in a way that's almost like
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:41.440]   philosophically terrifying. It just reminds you, maybe humbles you that you don't know anything
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:49.360]   about anything. But one of the things we do as humans really well is we, especially with kids,
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.640]   you realize, okay, we start caring for others in the community, in the family and so on,
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.720]   and that distracts us. Because then we can at least focus on other people's problems and not
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.200]   deal with our own. -
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:07.760]   When I was a medical student, I was particularly fascinated with kind of what actually happens as
[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:12.080]   people die, like in the last minutes, seconds of life. It's sort of surprising sometimes,
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:18.640]   like what actually kills people. You can get, let's say, a bad head injury, and what kills
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:25.120]   you sometimes, it's just your consciousness decreases and you become kind of comatose.
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:30.880]   You aspirate, your oxygen plummets, and you get cardiac arrest. That kind of sequence of events.
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:37.440]   Or a heroin overdose, let's say you stop breathing, similarly, your oxygen goes down,
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:41.280]   then you get a cardiac arrest. So I was really fascinated with what actually happens,
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:46.960]   what makes people die. And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously, like most of med school is.
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:54.000]   And I had many instances where I've had patients pass, and as a medical student, I was sort of
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.840]   learning what's actually happening, watching it happen, and not always being able to prevent it.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:06.160]   It was sort of a scientific exploration. Then the patient's family comes in and are just devastated.
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:12.000]   And then it rips you out of the scientific perspective, and you just realize how horrible
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.840]   death is. But the person's fine. It's the family, I guess. And that's why, I guess,
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:23.040]   that pointed out just how what people leave behind is often kind of the horribleness of death. Like,
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:27.920]   just becoming unconscious and staying that way doesn't seem, I guess, to me personally, so bad.
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.800]   It's sort of like going to sleep, not waking up, not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:37.760]   - So the actual pain, the actual suffering is often felt by the people who love the person
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:46.160]   who died. So both financial pain, psychological pain, for years missing them, all those kinds
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:50.880]   of things. - Right. Never forgetting. The anniversary of their death, you know, just
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:56.960]   having flashbacks or something reminding you. That sort of brought home to me sort of what
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.440]   death means. And it was more about what people leave behind than what happens to them specifically.
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:09.040]   - See, I like those concerns, because I feel like I can do a lot about those. Those make sense to me.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:16.000]   Then just be, if you're a father, just be a good father. You mentioned sort of insurance. Yeah,
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.760]   there's like financial stuff to take care of. What I don't know what to do with
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:28.080]   is the philosophical existential crisis of the fact that this freaking thing ends.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:36.480]   It doesn't, I don't know how to deal with the mystery that's beyond death. Why are we here?
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:41.840]   Why are we born at all? What is consciousness? And you just look at yourself. What is this?
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:47.920]   Why do I have the capacity to suffer? Why? Why? All these kinds of why questions that
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:51.200]   don't have answers. Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:56.000]   The biggest ridiculous one. What do you think is the meaning of life?
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:03.360]   Having with this book studied the incredible, beautiful biology of life,
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:10.720]   the components, the engineering components that make up this human body. But when you look at
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:17.840]   the entirety of it, what is why? Why are we here? - Sometimes, probably more often than not,
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:24.320]   feel like the question of why is a trick of the human brain. And outside of our thoughts,
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:29.120]   there is no why. Why is not something that's in the universe. It's just this trick happening
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:36.480]   inside our brain. - So, why is a game that the human brain plays on itself? And then
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:43.520]   the reality of life doesn't have whys. - I do wonder if asking why is sort of an
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:49.920]   evolutionary adaptation. Like, you know, maybe hunting, gathering, why does this plant grow
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:56.720]   there and not there? Why do I see the same deer tracks by the same tree every three days? Why is
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:04.960]   this? Why is that? Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn't? I guess those whys
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:11.360]   are very practical and oriented towards survival. But then obviously, you know, we not only use why,
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:15.920]   you know, we use it to maybe hunt better, gather better, survive better, but then we sort of
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:23.680]   extrapolate it into these unanswerable questions, you know, about why. Like, why does life exist?
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:29.200]   - And it's possible that they're not unanswerable in the long arc of science and history.
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:35.360]   It's we're just striving for the really difficult questions. Right now, we just don't know much
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:41.120]   about anything. And so, we're striving. But there's long, so most of human history,
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:48.320]   you were asking why questions for which we now have very precise answers, including with biology
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:53.840]   and physics and all those kinds of things. And maybe the why is this cutting edge of science,
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:42:00.480]   of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind. Like, man's search for meaning is the sort
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:07.760]   of the ultimate driver of the why. And it's almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:16.160]   of asking exceptionally hard why questions that will never get answered. Like, so you should
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:22.480]   always have, like, it's like a queue. It's a stack of questions, why questions, and that thing should
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:28.240]   never come to the bottom. Should always be striving. And that's useful for humans to come
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:34.640]   up with better and better ways of survival. And maybe in a bigger perspective for the universe
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:39.520]   to figure out something about itself. And it's just humans, just a useful tool for that.
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:48.800]   Or life on earth as a useful tool for that. Well, John, you're, for people who should know,
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:54.000]   you're from Philadelphia. I'm from Philadelphia. So, it's an honor that you would travel all this
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:00.320]   way from a place I love to the new place I love. And that you write this really incredible book
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:05.600]   that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways. And thank you for everything you do,
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.200]   for being a great educator, for being a great doctor, for being a great person,
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:12.640]   and for spending your really valuable time with me today. Thank you, John.
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:13.680]   Thanks for having me, Lex.
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:18.640]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jonathan Reisman. To support this podcast,
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:23.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:29.360]   Paul Farmer, a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me with the way he practiced medicine
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:36.800]   and the way he lived his life. The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that
