[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Good Monday morning and welcome to a new week
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.920]   on the podcast, a week we're devoting to the theme
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.200]   of knowing and following God's will.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.180]   Today we look at the key to it all.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.480]   Without this key in place, following God's will will be,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.220]   well, it'll be impossible, quite frankly.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.680]   And then on Wednesday, we're gonna look at an example
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160]   of how one man proceeded with confidence
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.440]   in a very real life decision that he had to make
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.080]   knowing that he was following God's will, he knew it.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.840]   It's a great story and that's on Wednesday in APJ 1808.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.280]   And then we'll end this week hearing
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.460]   from a super busy Christian man.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.680]   How does he prioritize his life
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.680]   when he cannot get everything done?
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.360]   That's on Friday in APJ 1809.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.540]   So we start the week talking about the key to knowing
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.160]   and following God's will.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.280]   We'll get there and we'll get there through a Bible question
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.520]   from a listener named Kyle.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.860]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.240]   In Colossians 1:9, Paul uses the terms knowledge,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.960]   wisdom, and understanding.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.440]   Do these terms each have a different meaning?
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   How do these three words relate to each other
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.720]   in the context of that passage in Colossians 1:9?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400]   Pastor John, what would you say to Kyle?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120]   - Yes, I think they do have different meanings.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.560]   And I think there's a practical usefulness
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.240]   in trying to understand the differences.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.200]   But it's good to keep in mind,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.180]   I step back and just let myself think about the difficulties
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.800]   of handling words like this.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   And I think that the way the human mind works
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.980]   and the way language works,
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.400]   it would be a mistake to think that words like knowledge
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   or knowing, wisdom, understanding are so precise
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.680]   that they don't overlap with each other.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   They do overlap.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.880]   The borders between words like knowledge and wisdom
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.080]   and understanding are not like walls,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.920]   not like fences that are real nice and clear and precise
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.320]   with one field on one side, one field on the other.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.640]   They're more like the space where the fresh water
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.880]   of a river flows into the salt sea.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.360]   And you can't draw a line between fresh water
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.120]   and salt water, but everybody knows
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.720]   there's a huge difference between fresh water
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.760]   and salt water.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.640]   Words that refer to processes of knowing
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   and words that refer to processes of feeling
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   are inevitably more flexible and more imprecise
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.520]   than words that refer to objects like dog or daffodil
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   or peach.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520]   Acts of knowing and feeling are not like a dog
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.400]   or daffodil or a peach.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.320]   You can't see them, you can't touch them,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.440]   you can't hear them, you can't smell them,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   you can't draw them.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.500]   How would you draw wisdom?
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.560]   How would you draw understanding?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.820]   You can't point to them with your finger.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.280]   They're a peculiar kind of reality.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.380]   And so when language tries to capture them
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.860]   or give expression to that peculiar kind of reality,
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.540]   we have to leave room for some overlap in meaning.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.820]   So that's a preface to how difficult it is sometimes
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.600]   to do what Kyle is asking me to do.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.140]   Colossians 1.9 says, "From the day we heard,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.700]   "we have not ceased to pray for you,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.700]   "asking that you may be filled with the knowledge."
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.300]   That's the first word, the knowledge,
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   epignosin in Greek, "of his will in all spiritual wisdom."
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   Second word, Sophia, "and understanding,"
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.700]   sunesis, sometimes translated insight.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.120]   So three words, knowledge, wisdom, insight.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.180]   "So as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.740]   "fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.860]   "and increasing in," and then he returns to,
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.860]   "the knowledge of God," same word, epignosis.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.460]   So Paul starts by praying that they would be filled
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.640]   with the knowledge of God's will,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.300]   and he ends that prayer by praying
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.260]   that they would go on increasing
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.320]   in the knowledge of God himself.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.820]   And I think in Paul's mind, knowing God increasingly
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.060]   and knowing God's will increasingly
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.760]   are part of the same experience of knowing.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.180]   Because to know somebody, when you think about it,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.740]   to know somebody is to know what they love,
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.960]   know what they hate, know what they desire,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.700]   know what they will, that's what it means to know them.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.780]   But to really grasp what Paul means by knowing God,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.760]   which I think we must do here at the outset,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.980]   it helps to look at Romans 1:18 to 23,
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.980]   where Paul talks about people who are outside Christ
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.100]   and yet have some kind of knowing of God.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.100]   It says, "By their unrighteousness, they suppress the truth.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.240]   "For what can be known about God is plain to them
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   "because God has shown it to them.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.040]   "For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.860]   "and divine nature, have been clearly perceived
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.280]   "ever since the creation of the world
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.920]   "in the things that have been made.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.800]   "So they are without excuse for all the,"
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.760]   this is the amazing part, "although they knew God."
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.560]   It's an amazing statement.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.400]   "Although they knew God, every human being outside Christ,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.880]   "although they knew God, they did not honor him as God
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.960]   "or give thanks to him."
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.680]   So there is a kind of knowing God
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.400]   that is absolutely useless, indeed worse than useless.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.700]   It makes you guilty.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.780]   It takes away your excuse.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.480]   This is not the kind of knowing God
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.320]   or knowing his will that Paul is praying for.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.840]   In Colossians 1:9, that's not what he's praying for.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.640]   So the question is, what's missing?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.680]   What's the difference between the knowing God
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.040]   and knowing his will that he's praying for
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.840]   and the knowing that will only get you damned?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.080]   What's missing is precisely what Paul is praying for
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   in Acts 1:9, namely, that we would come to know God
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.400]   and know his will in or by spiritual wisdom
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.000]   and spiritual understanding.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   The word spiritual modifies both of those nouns,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.000]   spiritual wisdom, spiritual understanding,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.640]   and the key word is spiritual,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.760]   which in Paul's language refers to something
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   that is given by and formed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.440]   It's not just a vague feeling of mysticism
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.380]   or something like that.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.600]   It's a spirit, a Holy Spirit given,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   a Holy Spirit shaped wisdom and understanding.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   So what needs to happen so that the man of Romans 1
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.880]   knows God the way Paul is praying for us to know God
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   and his will in Colossians 1:9 is for the Holy Spirit
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.160]   to take away his blindness to the greatness
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.880]   and the beauty and worth of God.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   And we can watch this happen in 2 Corinthians 4:6,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.780]   where Paul says, "God, who said,
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.320]   "'Let light shine out of darkness,'
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.860]   "has shone in our hearts to give the light
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.860]   "of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.200]   "in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.000]   So the formerly blind man of Romans 1
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.680]   now sees God as glorious.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.440]   And a few verses earlier, 318, 2 Corinthians 318,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.920]   Paul had said in describing this very miracle,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   "This comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.440]   So this miracle of seeing God for what he really is
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.880]   is what Paul means in Colossians 1:9 by spiritual insight.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.440]   Or spiritual understanding.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.240]   When the Holy Spirit removes our blindness,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.160]   we don't just know God as Romans 1 knows God,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   disapproving, suppressing.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   We know him as glorious, as infinitely valuable,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.920]   as worthy of all our allegiance and trust and love.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   This is spiritual understanding, to know him like that.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.480]   Now stir in the word wisdom,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   and specifically spiritual wisdom from Colossians 1:9.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   So let's go back to Romans 1 because Paul does just that.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.680]   He stirs in the word wisdom.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.520]   He's been describing the unbelieving person
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.920]   as knowing God and yet suppressing that knowledge
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.640]   and failing to thank God and glorify him.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.400]   And now he describes this same failure
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   in terms of foolishness and pretended wisdom.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.000]   He says, "They became futile in their thinking
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.680]   "and their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   "Claiming to be wise, they became fools."
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.280]   And then they do something
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.000]   which tells you what wisdom is all about.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.520]   They exchange the glory of the immortal God
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   for images resembling mortal man.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.000]   So in Paul's mind, wisdom and foolishness relate
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.480]   not merely to whether we see things clearly,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   but whether we make choices or experience preferences
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.640]   which fit reality.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.560]   If the darkened heart is not illumined
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   by spiritual understanding,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.000]   then the heart will act foolishly
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.880]   and make the absurd exchange of Romans 1:23,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.760]   trading away God for something he made.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.840]   That's foolish, that's crazy.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.040]   And that's what the lack of wisdom does.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.320]   Spiritual wisdom would never do that.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.080]   Spirit-given understanding of the true worth of God
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.080]   leads to spirit-given wisdom in not making absurd choices
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.760]   that involve treating other things
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.440]   as more valuable than God.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.160]   So in answer to Kyle's question,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.960]   one way to describe the difference
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   between spiritual wisdom and spiritual understanding
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.720]   is that spiritual understanding
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.480]   is the work of the spirit enabling us to see reality,
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.280]   particularly God, in his ways, his will,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.720]   for what they really are,
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.800]   namely great and beautiful and valuable and wise,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.480]   while spiritual wisdom is the effect
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   of that spiritual understanding
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.920]   upon the way we evaluate things
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   and the way we experience preferences in our preferring heart
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.520]   and the way we make choices that accord with or not,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.280]   are in harmony with or not, reality,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   and not the result of our former blindness.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.240]   So when Paul prays in Colossians 1:9
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   that we would be filled with the knowledge of his will
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.280]   in all spiritual or by all spiritual wisdom
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.840]   and spiritual understanding,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   he's asking God to pour out his Holy Spirit upon us
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.820]   and that more and more,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.920]   the spirit would remove our blindness
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.440]   and the dimness of our ability
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.660]   to see God for who he really is.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.480]   And then as a fruit of that spiritual understanding,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.760]   we would have spiritual wisdom
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.060]   that experiences preferences and makes choices
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.360]   that are in harmony with reality.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.240]   And then when those two are operating the way they should,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   we will be filled with the knowledge of God's will
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.160]   for our daily lives.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.000]   - So good.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And speaking of these two things operating
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.840]   in the way they should,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.640]   we're gonna look at a very specific example
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.620]   of how this works next time on Wednesday.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.240]   So thank you for joining us today.

[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   So how do we make confident life choices
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.520]   that accord to God's will?
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.800]   We're gonna take today's principles
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.720]   and see them work out in practice next time.
