[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   [Music]
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.200]   To obey God is to love God, right?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.800]   Well, it depends on what you mean, as John Piper explained in his message titled,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.000]   "What Jesus Demands from the World," preached at the Gospel Coalition 2015 Conference.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.600]   Here's what Pastor John said.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:34.400]   And how many people have you ever heard say loving God or loving Jesus is obeying Jesus?
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.200]   Basing it on the text, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments," John 14, 15.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.600]   "If you love me, you'll keep my commandments."
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   That text says the opposite of that.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.200]   An "if then" sentence doesn't say that the "then" or the "if" are the same.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.000]   If I'm hungry, I'll eat lunch.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800]   It doesn't mean hunger is lunch.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.000]   "If you love me, you'll obey," doesn't mean love is obedience.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.800]   It means, in fact, it comes before and enables.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.600]   If you love me, you will obey, but they're not the same.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.400]   Love goes first, underneath, holding up, staying in the yoke, abiding, enjoying, treasuring,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   marveling, being entranced by, being filled with.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.600]   And out of that, a good tree bears good fruit.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200]   A bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000]   Make the tree good.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   That's another command that's off later in the book.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   So my answer to the second question, what is this love, is first, it is not synonymous
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   with obedience.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   What is it?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.160]   Well, how about Matthew 6, 24?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   No one can serve two masters.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.720]   Either he will hate the one and love, love the other, or he'll be devoted to the one
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.640]   and despise the other.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.040]   What kind of language is that?
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   Hate love, despise devotion.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.000]   That's real heart-laden, emotional, affectional language, right?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.800]   And that's the way Jesus talked about whether you love God or money.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.560]   Are you sold out in such a love affair with money and what it can buy that Jesus is not
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.200]   your highest treasure anymore, or is Jesus so completely satisfying as your highest treasure
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.480]   that money is not in that idolatrous position?
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   Those are your two options.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.440]   So love in Jesus' talk is not doing, it is treasuring.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.120]   Did you treasure me above everything?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   And that brings us back to 1037 in Matthew, right?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.760]   If you love me less than your mom and dad, if you love your children more than you love
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.880]   me, those are relationships of great.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   I love my kids.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.440]   I die for my kids.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   I enjoy my kids.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.120]   I treasure my kids.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   That's the talk.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   That's the language.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   That's the affectional, emotional dimension.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.320]   When I was a junior at Wheaton ages ago, '67, it was the fall of '67 or spring, I can't
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   remember which.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   '67.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.560]   Miller Derrickson was my teacher in apologetics, and we were reading Joseph Fletcher's Situation
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.600]   Ethics, a very bad book.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   And he knew it was bad, and he loved to assign...
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.720]   He assigned four bad books.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.240]   And we read them, and we were supposed to critique, and he would come into class and
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   play the bad guy.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.000]   It was a very exciting class.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.280]   I loved it.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.180]   And Joseph Fletcher argued love cannot be an emotion.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.760]   It can only be an action or an act of will.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   Why?
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.560]   It is commanded.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.840]   And you can't command the emotions.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.920]   Turn them on, turn them off, turn them on.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.000]   They don't work like that.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That was the argument.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.920]   And I can remember, I mean, I'm just a brand new budding theologian.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   Like don't know anything.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.040]   21 years old.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.080]   And I grew up in a home where we read the Bible every day and believed it.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.120]   And one of the glorious things about growing up in a Bible-believing home where you read
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.160]   the Bible every day is that it affects your olfactory, your theological nose.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.000]   So you smell stuff before you can understand how bad it is.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.160]   Something's wrong here.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.980]   This smells wrong.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.980]   And you can't say it.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.980]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.380]   A lot of you are, you know, not theologically educated, but you've got great noses.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.060]   You walk into a room or something and they're talking about it and you're like, "That's
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   not right.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.060]   Not right."
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.580]   And they say, "What's wrong with it?"
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.020]   You say, "I'm just not sure.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.300]   I'll go study up on it, but I know something's wrong here."
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.300]   So I'm sitting in that class and, "That's not right."
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.020]   You know what was not right about it?
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.140]   The New Testament commands the emotions everywhere.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.620]   I mean, duh, you can't command the emotions?
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.660]   Give me a break.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.340]   We're commanded to be grateful.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.660]   We're commanded to hope.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.660]   We're commanded to rejoice.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.020]   We're commanded to be sorrowful and weep.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   I mean, you know what?
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.300]   I've got a list of what, 15 emotions from the New Testament, including Jesus, which
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   God commands.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.180]   Which is why Augustine says, "Command what you will and give what you command."
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.060]   Because premise number three in Fletcher's argument is true.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.180]   You can't turn them on and off, which is why people think they can't be commanded.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.900]   It makes us feel helpless.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.460]   You're commanding me to be happy in Jesus?
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.020]   What do you expect me to do?
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.500]   Kind of start jumping up and down and hope it happens?
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.020]   That's the kind of response you get.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.100]   No, he expects you to be born again.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.700]   Be a new person.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.260]   And yes, it's beyond your control.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.180]   And yes, we are desperate.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.100]   And yes, we need to pray for revival in America.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.020]   Nothing we do is going to turn this land around or your church around or your soul around.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.760]   God will turn it around and we have to ask for miracles, the Spirit to fall on us so
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.140]   that we are changed.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.660]   This clip comes from John Piper's sermon, "What Jesus Demands from the World," preached
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.380]   at the Gospel Coalition Conference on April 14th, 2015.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.140]   You can download the entire message from our site at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.340]   The sermon clips in this podcast typically come from you.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.820]   And this one comes from listener Ty Schimansky.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.820]   Thank you, Ty.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.340]   And if you have a favorite clip from a John Piper sermon, send us the name of the sermon
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.260]   and the timestamps of when and where the audio appears in the audio recording, and we will
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.620]   share it on this podcast and give you credit, of course.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.900]   Tell us the details at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org and put the word "clip" in the subject
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.900]   line.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.740]   Well, at Desiring God, we believe in functional differences between men and women, but not
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.820]   because it's easy.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.140]   No, egalitarians have it easy.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.060]   Complementarians have a lot to think through because this functional distinction in Scripture
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.020]   raises a number of questions about how men and women relate in the church, in the family,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.780]   and in the workplace, and all in a way that honors God's creative, intentional distinctions.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.860]   Tomorrow John Piper will respond to a question from a woman who wants to serve in the police
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.260]   force but wants to know if this violates any biblical principles.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.220]   We'll have to think it through tomorrow.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.220]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.100]   We'll see you tomorrow.
