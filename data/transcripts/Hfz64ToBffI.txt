[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Well, Jesus is my substitute. He became sin for me that I might stand before God righteous and forgiven.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's beautifully true in 2 Corinthians 5:21.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   But is Jesus also my joy substitute to my hope for when I fail to delight in God as I ought to?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   It's a really sharp question from a listener named Jake.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Hello Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I love the fact that Jesus is my substitute in any way that I display Christ-likeness.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   It's something all made possible by the cross of Christ and the Spirit's work inside of me.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Christ was sexually faithful for me because I was not.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   In Him I find forgiveness for my past and power to fight my lust today.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Similarly, Christ was never arrogant for me so that I can be forgiven of my angry past
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and given the power to fight my own arrogant heart today.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So I wonder if this paradigm also applies to my joy.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Is it true that Christ was fully satisfied in God for me so that I am not condemned for my sourness
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   but so that my lack of joy in God is forgiven and I can be free to pursue my joy in God daily?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   When I fail, I rest in Christ, the perfect Christian hedonist who paid for all my heart's idols,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and there I find renewed hope to press on in seeking after God.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   In other words, is Jesus also my joy substitute?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   That's pretty thoughtful. I like that. I like this question a lot.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But I'm sure that not all of our listeners are tracking with Jake's pretty remarkable grasp
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   of the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So let me put some Bible verses under it and then answer his question straight up.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He's applying the doctrine of justification by saying that all the defects of my obedience to God,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   my shortfall in keeping God's commandments, do not keep me from being justified in the courtroom of heaven
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   or from being vindicated and declared not guilty but, in fact, declared righteous in God's sight.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He's saying, rightly, that all this is owing to the perfect obedience and righteousness of Jesus,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   which through faith alone is counted as mine.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   In union with Christ, Christ's perfections are credited to my account so that God's wrath is taken away
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and he is 100% for me as I am in Christ.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So here's where Jake is getting that.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   1 Corinthians 1:30, "From God are you in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Or Romans 5:19, "As by one man's disobedience, namely Adam, the many were appointed sinners,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   so by one man's obedience, Christ, the many will be appointed righteous."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Or 2 Corinthians 5:21, "For our sake God made him to be sin who knew no sin,"—that's Jesus—
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   "so that in him,"—in union with him—"we might become the righteousness of God."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Philippians 3:9, "We are found in him,"—in union with him—"not having a righteousness of our own
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   that comes from law, but that which comes through faith in Christ,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   the righteousness from God that depends on faith."
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Now Jake is asking if this applies to our joy failures in the Christian life.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Joy is commanded by God. It's one of his commands. Rejoice in the Lord.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And again, I say rejoice. One of the central tenets of my life is that joy is essential
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   for honoring God and obeying God, because we're commanded to treasure Christ
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and be satisfied in him and rejoice in him above all things.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So Jake is asking if we are defective in this regard,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   is the perfect rejoicing of Christ counted as mine, like all the other aspects of his obedience are?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Now here goes my answer. So I want you to listen carefully, everybody,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   because I took a long time thinking about this sentence, okay, these two sentences.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Here's my answer. The sinful defects of our joy in this life are forgiven,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and the righteous joyfulness of Jesus is imputed to us in the same way
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that all of our sinful defects as Christians are forgiven,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and all of Christ's righteousness is imputed to us, namely, by our union with the perfect Jesus Christ,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   which we enter, that union, we enter this union by faith, and which we confirm,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   so we enter it by faith alone, and we confirm by Spirit-enabled holiness, including holy joy in Christ.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now let me take a minute and unpack that answer. There are two implications of what I'm saying.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   One has to do with the faith by which we enter union with Christ,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and the other has to do with the works of faith that the Holy Spirit enables us to do after we are in Christ,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   which confirm that we really are new creatures in Christ.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So one at a time. The implication regarding faith in Jesus through which we enter into union with Christ
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   is that Christ does not perform faith for us or instead of us in such a way that no faith is needed in us
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to enjoy union with him. In other words, the way Jake is applying the doctrine of justification
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   has been taken by some people to the extreme that they say, "I've read this. I really read this.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We don't need to even be believers if we are elect, because Christ believed perfectly on our behalf,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and his belief is credited to us when we are unbelievers."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Now, Jake is not saying that, but others have followed that logic of imputation to that unbiblical conclusion.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And the reason it's unbiblical is that faith is the instrument God uses to unite us to Christ
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and only in union with Christ then do his perfections count on our behalf.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   The faithfulness of Christ doesn't replace the requirement of faith to be united to the faithful Christ.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   That's the first implication. Justification by faith does not mean that Christ's perfect belief
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   replaces the requirement for us to believe. Here's the second implication.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Christ's obedience, which is imputed to us, also does not replace the obedience
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   we are required to have as the fruit of our union with Christ.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Here's 2 Thessalonians 2, 213. We are "saved through sanctification by the Spirit."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   In other words, the reality of saving faith is confirmed in sanctification—
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   that is, in lived-out, Spirit-enabled obedience, including the obedience of joy in Jesus,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   treasuring Jesus, being satisfied in Jesus.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Christ's holiness does not replace the requirement of our holiness.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Hebrews 12, 14, "Strive for the holiness without which you will not see the Lord."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That's spoken to believers. To be sure, our holiness is not the ground of our justification.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Christ's holiness is. But our holiness confirms the reality of the faith
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   that unites us to Christ and his holiness.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So what does that imply about our joy in Christ?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It implies that Christ's perfect joy does not replace the requirement for us
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   to rejoice in Christ above all else. But because of our union with Christ,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   his perfect joy, counted as ours, covers all the defects in our joy.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So our joy, with all its defects, is a real fruit of the Spirit.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Galatians 5, 22, "a real fruit of the Spirit," and thus a real confirmation that we belong to Christ.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, for that clarification.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And Jake, thank you for the excellent question.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   As you apply Christian hedonism to your life, send us questions.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   What doesn't make sense to you? What seems hard to apply?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Send us those questions through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, speaking of hard topics, self-hate.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It's a topic that gets talked about a lot in our Western culture.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   So how would you go about sharing the gospel with an unbelieving friend who struggles here,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   who struggles with self-hate?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   That is the question for Pastor John.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   On Wednesday when we return, I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   [Silence]
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   [Silence]
