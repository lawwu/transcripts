[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   Well, ladies and gentlemen, exciting times to be alive.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.960]   It's getting real.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to helping you live a rich and meaningful
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.880]   life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less, although lately
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.680]   it's kind of turned into COVID central around here.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.080]   Hope you'll just stick with me.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.120]   I've actually tried three times in the last couple of days to record a couple of the shows
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.880]   and for a variety of reasons I have not been able to get it done.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.080]   I've been traveling this week.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   I'm in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.800]   Had a great meetup with a bunch of listeners last night and anyway, I sat down and did
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.280]   a couple of shows and I got several times into it.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   I just couldn't get it done.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   But this evening I felt like I got to turn the mic on.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.600]   So it's late at night here on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 and it's been a momentous day and
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240]   a momentous evening in the news of the day.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.360]   And so I wanted to just to get on the microphone, share with you a few ideas specifically about
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.240]   the flu pandemic, the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.800]   It's going to get worse before it gets better, but I'm going to try to give you some positive
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.920]   things to think about.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.980]   And then I'll try to give you just a few ideas on economics, but I will continue to talk
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.600]   about some other things.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.440]   Certainly things are being affected left, right and center all over the place.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   So let's begin.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.720]   The news is coming fast at the moment.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.360]   This evening, President Trump announced that the United States is, in addition to banning
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.280]   travel from, let's see, what is it?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.720]   South Korea and China, the United States is banning travelers from Europe, except the
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.280]   United Kingdom for the next 30 days.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.000]   That's a significant development.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   Evidently, Tom Hanks and his wife have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.960]   Just this evening, the NBA canceled the season.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.160]   I pulled up a little clip on YouTube of there was a game with the Jazz and some of the team
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.680]   getting ready to start and all of a sudden right at the beginning, all the officials
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.520]   are talking to one another and they canceled the game right before tip off.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.600]   Harvard University canceling all classes.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.880]   All classes are now going online.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   The stock market down again majorly today.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.360]   Stocks are, I think, officially in bear territory now, in a bear market.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.280]   And so that's a significant development.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.480]   And it seems like, I'll just tell you, just getting started, but it seems like the pace
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.820]   of change is just coming in constantly.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.820]   New headlines frequently.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.980]   I've got, I sit in a hotel room, I've got Bloomberg Business on right now watching the
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.680]   headlines come in minute after minute from all around the world.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720]   And certainly, these are, it's one of those crisis periods where things are happening.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.920]   People's browsing around the social networks a little bit and it seems like there's a great
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.200]   toilet paper shortage.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.840]   So that's a very significant need for a lot of people.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.360]   So it is remarkable just to see how fast things are changing.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.000]   Even I was thinking about politically.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.280]   I don't know if there has been ever any, I don't know if there's ever been political
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.760]   conditions that have been changing so quickly as they are, at least in presidential politics.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.720]   Senator Joe Biden was running for president a few weeks ago.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.240]   It looked like his campaign was completely on life support.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.920]   And I was feeling pretty confident that Senator Sanders would be the Democratic nominee for
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.260]   president and all of a sudden, two weeks, just bam, bam, bam, and everything changes.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.960]   So there's a lot of things happening very, very quickly.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.480]   And so I think we can expect that trend to continue.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.800]   But let's talk briefly.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.040]   I'll just give you my insight on the disease.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   I've been talking about it for a while.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.800]   So I released last week an optimistic, fairly optimistic sounding show.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.760]   I continue to maintain that optimism just simply because of what I think the data is
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.880]   demonstrating that this particular virus is probably not going to have quite the death
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   toll that I was worried that it would have.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.680]   And I'm also increasingly optimistic to see, although late, too late, I'm increasingly
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.840]   optimistic to see many people responding to the threat.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.080]   One of the things that's been so interesting to watch in China as the original, as COVID-19
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.160]   started to develop in China, it's been so fascinating to watch how they've been able
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   to successfully contain the virus through drastic measures.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   Now those measures were certainly very costly to China, but they were also effective and
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.000]   they stopped the spread of it.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.480]   And I think you see right now, Italy can totally shut down except for I think pharmacies and
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   grocery stores.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.720]   And I hope that that would stop the spread there.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.680]   The reality is we know how to stop the spread of a flu virus.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.480]   You stop basically all person to person contact.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.140]   That is effective and that slows the spread and stops the spread sufficient to get ahead
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:24.360]   of it and to give time for the hospital system to absorb the people who need help.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.280]   And so that's a really important component of it.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.320]   And so I'm optimistic about that.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.720]   I'm also very grateful that young people, children especially, seem to be shared.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.280]   I guess that's probably, I think we all share a love for children and a desire to see children
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.600]   protected.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   But as a father of four young children, I'm grateful for that.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now of course the virus continues to be very harmful for older people and for people with
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.600]   underlying health conditions.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.960]   So we need to be cautious.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.360]   But I think that I continue to be optimistic that the physical condition is not as bad
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   as I previously feared.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.900]   It's not to say that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people around the world may
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.660]   not die, but it's not going to be as bad as I previously feared.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.640]   Now there are a couple bits of data that are kind of against that thesis.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:28.320]   The thing that I have found most concerning was a piece that I read yesterday and shared,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.960]   I sent it to all my consulting clients.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.760]   And the headline here comes from the South China Morning Post.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.420]   The headline is, "Coronavirus can travel twice as far as the official safe distance and stay
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.340]   in the air for 30 minutes, Chinese study finds."
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.580]   What happened was some Chinese epidemiologists were studying a couple of cases in China and
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.220]   they were able to isolate some people who had contracted the disease on a bus from another
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.740]   person.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   And they found, it was a long distance coach bus where one person who was infected got
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.300]   onto a bus and sat down in the second row from the back.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:15.900]   Now in China all of the long distance buses have CCTV cameras on them and so the researchers
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:23.260]   were able to see exactly where the person sat and they were able to see exactly how
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.300]   the interaction played out between that person and other members.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:35.760]   And what they found was the infected person passed the infection on the bus to somebody
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.820]   who was four and a half meters away.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:46.180]   That was the closest they got, four and a half meters away.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.820]   That's to me pretty stunning and that's very concerning.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:08:01.180]   What they also found is 30 minutes later somebody came onto the bus and after the original infected
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:08.140]   person left, 30 minutes later a passenger came on and was infected.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:15.900]   And this just shows how infectious the disease is, just passing through small particles in
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.340]   the air from one person to another.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.460]   That's very, very concerning.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.220]   That's a really concerning piece.
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.460]   Then a listener, as I was talking about that online, a listener shared with me an article
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:36.340]   about a lawyer in New York City who infected about 50 people and I was reading, started
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:48.020]   to read more and was reading about somebody in Korea, a super spreader as they're known,
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.740]   who actually succeeded in passing the virus to thousands of people.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.400]   It's a person, individual known as patient 31.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.300]   So it's very, very infectious.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.300]   Now it's still, it can be defeated and so the strategy is social distancing, staying
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.980]   away from people, staying home and stopping and slowing the spread.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:17.060]   And that strategy is important because it may protect you from getting infected and
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:23.380]   in addition to that important goal it has the benefit of slowing down the spread of
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.220]   the disease so that you can have fewer people sick at one time which gives the medical system
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:38.620]   more of an opportunity to stay up to date, to stay current with people who are sick.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.020]   So in a moment I'll talk about kind of what you can do and I think one of the key things
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.700]   is as far as I'm concerned it is definitely time to be distancing yourself from people,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:57.100]   from crowds and bringing your movements and contact with people to the bare minimum.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.220]   Easier for some people than others but certainly possible.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.980]   Now let's talk about the economics of the situation.
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:13.380]   I continue to think that this very clearly is going to cause major and long-term economic
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.020]   disruptions.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:25.500]   The very best case I can see for the economic effects of this virus is simply devastating.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.140]   I consider devastating to be the bare minimum and we'll see where we're going to go from
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.140]   there.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:38.900]   But I want you to think about and to understand a little bit about why I consider this to
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.560]   be fairly certain at this point.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.820]   Why are stock markets down?
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.620]   Are stock markets down just because people are scared?
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.660]   No, stock markets are down for of course millions of reasons for all the individuals in it but
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.660]   because companies are going to be making a lot less money in days to come and that's
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:08.060]   big due to the only workable way to control this crisis which is to shut everything down.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.860]   But think about how widespread this is.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:27.180]   Again this is why the reason a virus is so horrific and so bad is the
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.540]   changes needed happen everywhere all at once.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.420]   If you have a local tornado, it happens in your town but in the virus you can see it
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.540]   is absolutely global.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.740]   So everything, everywhere is getting shut down all at once.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:46.100]   Yes, there are some countries that have been ahead of the curve in Asia and now in Europe
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.380]   ahead of the curve and the Americas are now starting to catch up but still practically
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:57.100]   speaking over a period of weeks where everything is shut down together over this period of
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.100]   weeks.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.420]   So everything gets shut down.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.700]   Everyone stays home and this happens simultaneously in every country, every state, every county,
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.300]   every family and this has a tremendous ripple effect.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.460]   I want you just to imagine the businesses that are hurt by this and the revenues that
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.860]   are lost by this.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.740]   I think the NBA is a good example since it was just tonight announced that the NBA is
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   suspending the season.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.100]   First think about the lost ticket revenue that was previously scheduled to be coming
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:34.720]   in to all of those franchises based upon their games.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.500]   Think about the lost TV revenue that all of the TV stations previously had committed.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.580]   What are the NBA, there's probably an NBA network on cable TV, what are they going to
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.140]   do now that the season is canceled?
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:54.820]   What about all of the NBA games that were previously scheduled to be booked on TV?
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.500]   What are the TV channels going to fill that time with?
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.460]   Think about all of the ad revenue that's lost by those TV channels for not having those
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.460]   games.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.580]   Think about all the revenue that's lost for the franchises by not being able to sell the
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.940]   TV rights to those games.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.500]   Think about then all of the probably the advertisers themselves who are going to have less money
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.040]   because they can't buy the advertising.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.320]   Think about the vendors and the concessions revenue that won't be gained by all the people
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.160]   working at the NBA games.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:32.120]   Think about all of the hotel revenue that'll be lost by all the travelers that were previously
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.480]   part of the NBA system.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.440]   Now that's not a big hotel driver, I'm thinking of other events, conventions, etc.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.960]   But think about all of the Uber revenue and the taxi revenue that's going to be lost because
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.720]   those games aren't going to happen.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.880]   Think about all of the restaurant tabs and the bar tabs that are not going to be generated
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.360]   because of those NBA games and how that's going to hurt all of the bartenders and the
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.560]   servers and the restaurants and the restaurateurs.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.840]   It just goes on and on and on and that's just one example of a huge example but that's just
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.800]   one industry, the NBA.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.480]   Now take that out to March Madness, take that out to the rodeo in the Houston rodeo or the
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.560]   Texas rodeo just canceled.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.100]   It's going to go to other things, NASCAR games and everything.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.440]   Think about the just the widespread disruption for months going forward and how across the
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:35.240]   board you have this domino effect where these cancellations just ripple outward, less money
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.280]   to spend and the money starts to freeze up.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:43.040]   And it's not that the money disappears, it's just that it starts to freeze up and that
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.560]   has a devastating effect to people who are in those affected industries.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:55.480]   So at the bare minimum this is going to be devastating and then could it be worse than
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.600]   devastating?
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.280]   Time will tell, right?
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:07.640]   It'll depend on how long these measures take place, it'll depend on what happens in the
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.800]   psychology of the people, etc.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.280]   Pay also attention to what we're experiencing.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:19.720]   We're starting to experience the kind of the contagion of panic so to speak.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   The news that I thought was really interesting here this evening was the news about Tom Hanks
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:38.160]   because when you have a widely loved person who has a great degree of notoriety, you wind
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.520]   up with a situation and they get sick, you wind up with a situation where people start
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.920]   to pay attention.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.760]   And I think you start to see that with the runs on toilet paper, the runs on soap, the
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.160]   runs on all this stuff.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.640]   So you're starting to see the kind of the contagion spread, the contagion of panic where
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.800]   nobody wants to be the last one shopping for toilet paper.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.680]   And you're starting to see the emotions come in where the system is breaking down where
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.480]   previously – let's use toilet paper as the example today because it's a really good example
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.520]   – maybe most people would go and buy toilet paper and they would say, "I'll just go
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.040]   ahead and get one thing of toilet paper because that's the normal amount that they shop,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.360]   one big package."
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.880]   But then all of a sudden they find out that toilet paper is in short supply and so they
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   go to the store and they figure, "I'll get two instead of one."
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.760]   And so the supplies start to get low and then that news starts to spread and today it spreads
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:39.000]   faster than ever before because any individual can produce that news among their community.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And so more and more people run out to the store to go and get more toilet paper.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.600]   And then the stores start rationing toilet paper to try to maintain it and so they say,
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.120]   "Maximum one per customer, maximum five per customer."
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.520]   Costco has been rationing products for the last few days, many different products.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.480]   And so then people – that just spreads further and then people say, "Well, I've got to get
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   around the rationing."
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.360]   And so they start going to multiple stores so they can get past and it just gets worse
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.640]   and worse and worse.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   And so the supply chain just totally breaks down because of the just-in-time inventory
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.660]   systems under which the supply chain is run.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.500]   It works fine and it has a little bit of flexibility but not a lot.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.880]   And so it can be disrupted very easily by unforeseen circumstances.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.400]   Similar example would be the mask crisis where healthcare providers are having a hard time
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.760]   getting a hold of masks and they're just not out there.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.280]   And so you see how the supply chain works fine during normal times but unless you stockpile
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:44.600]   the stuff and unless it was stockpiled by organizations, by governments, etc., by hospitals,
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:50.400]   then the things fall apart and because of the excess demand all of a sudden.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.760]   Now that's not a permanent condition.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.640]   Eventually people say, "All right, I've got enough toilet paper for okay.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.320]   I'm not going to die if I don't have 10 packs of toilet paper.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.800]   Three or four is fine."
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.760]   So they stop buying and then that gives time for the system to be replenished, etc.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.200]   And then there winds up being a toilet paper oversupply because everyone has enough to
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.080]   last them for months and most people aren't going to stock it and keep it stocked up in
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.040]   their house because they just don't want to have the stuff sitting around.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:21.840]   And so the store shelves get full again and then the revenues go way down.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.880]   So you can just watch it breaking down right now, right in front of your face.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:35.000]   And you can see how years ago I did a study on why price gouging laws are so destructive
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   and I believe immoral.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.680]   They're not a moral use of the law.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.040]   Now I'm not going to get all bent out of shape about that and jump up and down on my soap
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.240]   box but they're at least destructive.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.320]   You can see how stupid they are because what they do is you wind up, if you don't allow
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.520]   the pricing system to react, then the stores wind up regulating demand by rationing.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.360]   You can either ration based on price or you can ration based on person.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   And since it's generally not, it's considered a bad business, which I support, it is bad
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.720]   business to do, but it's also considered to be illegal in many places to raise prices
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.200]   to respond to demand.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.600]   What happens is the demand quickly outstrips the supply and strips the supply from the
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.400]   shelves and then you wind up with shortages.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.760]   And if you're frustrated right now that you can't find toilet paper and you're not sure
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.360]   what you're going to do in the coming days when you don't have any toilet paper, well,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   consider that next time you start proposing for price gouging laws that result in you're
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.160]   not having toilet paper.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.480]   You'd probably rather have gone and paid a $20 for a little four pack of toilet paper,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.920]   which would be an extremely high price, but at least you'd have a little bit instead of
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.760]   not having any available simply because all the store shelves were stripped bare.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.960]   And if you were willing to pay $20 for some toilet paper, all of a sudden some of those
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.200]   people who bought three big cases of it might be willing to spread it out.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.480]   You know, if I bought three big cases at the standard price of $10 for a case, I'd be happy
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.920]   to sell some of mine for $20.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.280]   And so maybe there'll be a black market in toilet paper.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.400]   Let me know if you're seeing that.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.720]   But that's just how economic systems work.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.520]   So notice, please, I don't like to say I told you so.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.480]   I really would like to be wrong on some of this stuff because it really stinks and I
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.120]   don't like to gloat.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.600]   But notice, how can you protect yourself?
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.400]   How should you have protected yourself from this?
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.840]   The answer is simply by stockpiling the things that you would need.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.540]   Throughout the entire history of radical personal finance, I've emphasized this to you.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.560]   You don't have a need to be efficient with the things that your family needs.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.940]   You don't have the need to be efficient.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.400]   You don't have the need to run everything at the razor thin line.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:58.240]   It's easy enough for you to keep half a dozen packs of toilet paper in the garage and that's
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.960]   your buffer.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.280]   Well half a dozen big things of toilet paper from Costco will last you for a long time.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.640]   And so you just put that on a shelf out in the garage, take one down, replace it.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.860]   And that way you've always got a half of a, you know, six, half a dozen cases of toilet
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.000]   paper as your personal buffer.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.680]   Doesn't cost you much, takes a little bit of storage space, but it protects you when
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.540]   there's a toilet paper crisis of 2020.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.760]   So you protect yourself by stocking up.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.280]   Same thing with food, same thing with medicine.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.160]   You put the buffer in there because you don't need to be efficient.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.600]   The needs of your family with most of these things are very, very small.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.160]   I think the mask situation is another good example.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.440]   You can just simply see that people who are in those situations, imagine the pressure
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.120]   that's on a hospital administrator.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.200]   The hospital administrator knows that we need to stockpile personal protective equipment
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.560]   for our workers.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.680]   But that stockpile comes with a cost.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.920]   And you know that it's possible that someday there could be a flu pandemic or someday there
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.560]   could be a contagious disease outbreak and we need to have lots of extra masks to protect
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.080]   the patients and protect ourselves, et cetera.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.160]   And so they can stockpile large amounts of it, but the stuff expires, it goes bad.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.120]   And so are you really going to feel good as a hospital administrator putting this stuff
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   on year after year after year in very large amounts that have to be stored, that have
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.660]   to be cared for, that have to be rotated and then just seeing the stuff expire year after
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.980]   year after year?
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.240]   And so eventually you say, "Oh, let's get by with a little bit less, a little bit less,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.840]   a little bit less."
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.200]   And then the supply chain narrows down to one region of the world.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:44.120]   There was a book that was written by the guy that was on Joe Rogan's show having a talk
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.080]   about this and he talked about how 80% of the blood, was it the blood?
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.120]   The IV bags were produced in Puerto Rico.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.700]   And when the hurricane came through Puerto Rico, it devastated those factories and led
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:03.440]   to a real global shortage of IV bags.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.340]   But a hospital administrator has to worry about that and there's a pressure to press
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.520]   towards efficiency, got to be efficient, can't stockpile too much stuff because it's just
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.080]   a huge amount of money.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.440]   But that's not you.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.920]   You can stockpile the stuff and it not be a big deal.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.940]   You can stockpile masks.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.240]   You can stockpile personal protective equipment.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.080]   You can stockpile hazmat suits.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.600]   You can stockpile all of that stuff.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.040]   And in the grand scheme of your finances, it's not a big financial cost.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.220]   It's an annoyance to store.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.640]   It is a cost of storage but it's not a big financial cost.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.720]   And storage, as long as you've got a way to do it in an organized way, it's not that big.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.260]   So what can you do right now?
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:50.320]   Right now, I think it's early to start talking about big opportunities.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.880]   I think it's very, very early to start talking about economic opportunities.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:00.040]   And so I'll try in the future to just talk about some ways to profit from an event.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.440]   I do want you just to keep your head up and to stay focused on being positive.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.180]   And I don't mean that in some kind of woo-woo ignore reality.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.400]   But what I do mean is be realistic.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:17.440]   If you go back and you study times of great panic, times of great crisis, there are always
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.520]   opportunities.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:27.480]   And many people make their fortunes during a time of crisis.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.360]   So we shouldn't be scared about crisis.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.320]   It happens.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.880]   But if you'll keep a level head on your shoulders, look for opportunities, there will be opportunities.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.240]   We don't know yet what those are.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.920]   We're just getting started.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.680]   It's going to be, in my opinion, it's going to be a long and slow crisis.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.600]   And you are going to get so annoyed.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.760]   And I'm not going to turn radical personal finance into COVID central.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.720]   I already feel like I've done it too much.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.440]   We're not going to sit around here and talk about it all the time.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   Talk about it on occasion.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.080]   But this is going to be a long and slow crisis.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.640]   It's going to grind on for months and months and months before it stabilizes.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.880]   And we'll see what's on the other side.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.320]   I'm not going to make too many predictions beyond that, just that it's going to be very
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   slow.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.480]   You're going to be so tired of it.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.560]   I'm going to be so tired of it.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.360]   But what can you do right now?
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:25.560]   Well, the most useful, valuable thing you can do right now is isolate yourself and your
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.760]   family.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.120]   I think it's time to do that.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.040]   Isolate yourself and your family.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.720]   Now that's going to be hard to figure out how to do it and what exactly that means,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.800]   to what extent you can do.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.320]   And all of us have different circumstances.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.480]   I'm traveling right now.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.440]   I'm just hoping I can get home.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:50.900]   And if I can get home, then I'll hunker down with my family and hopefully I don't get sick
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.900]   in the airport.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.480]   I did my best to take precautions, but who knows.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.680]   But isolate yourself and your family, and especially older family members.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:06.120]   Isolate yourself and your family so that you can protect older family members, especially
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   for the coming weeks.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.880]   As things start to, we're right at the start, as I, in my opinion, we're right at the start
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.640]   of the compound growth curve in the United States.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.680]   And what's been happening is the virus has been percolating out across the community,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.080]   spreading from thousands and thousands of people to thousands and thousands of more
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   people.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.360]   But now those symptoms are going to start to be seen.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:34.160]   And you have a complete and total debacle of undiagnosed cases, lack of testing.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.360]   It's almost impossible for people to get testing, and this is just enhancing the spread.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:44.000]   And the United States reacted far too slowly of closing things, shutting things down, too
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.340]   little too late.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.440]   And so there are thousands and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people right
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.400]   now who are infected all across the United States.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:59.840]   And so I would say that what's needed right now is simply take the action early to isolate
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840]   yourself.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.040]   Isolate, especially if you're elderly, especially if you have underlying health conditions that
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.800]   weaken your immune system.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.020]   Take the action now to isolate yourself as much as you can, as much as you're willing
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.200]   to do.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.120]   And give it a few more weeks to start to stabilize, to see what happens, and to start to get a
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.920]   better idea of the risks, a better idea of the numbers, and see if we can get ahead of
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.320]   it.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.200]   I think that's important.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   That's the most reliable thing that you can do.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.680]   Now you may not be able to go all the way.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:42.180]   Right now, companies that can, you know, there was just a moment ago, Twitter is now ordering
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.960]   all of their workers to work from home.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.040]   If you can work from home, you should.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   If you can minimize that stuff, you should.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.980]   And remember, in order for isolation to work, you got to do it early before it really seems
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.480]   like it has to be done.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   Maybe I shouldn't have traveled.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   I don't know.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   We'll find out.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   Maybe I'll be sick in a week.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.280]   But you got to do it early.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.960]   So it's going to feel stupid.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.320]   I was talking with my wife.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   What are we going to do?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.760]   It's going to feel stupid because you're going to look around and say, "There's not really
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.160]   any need for it."
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.000]   But that's the right time to do it.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.160]   Cancel community events.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:29.040]   I think at this point it's a good idea to cancel travel, etc., and just simply focus
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.120]   on isolating yourself.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:38.760]   Now, there are opportunities, though, to make that a positive thing, to make plans.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.080]   You probably had a long list of goals and things that you've been wanting to accomplish
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.840]   that you haven't had a chance to accomplish because you've been so busy.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.040]   Maybe you wanted to work out more.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.880]   YouTube is your friend.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.960]   There are thousands and thousands of people who've made workout videos that don't require
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   any equipment.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.240]   You can do them right at home.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.140]   Pop a video on and start getting fit right at home.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.000]   You probably wanted to read more.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.400]   Well, Amazon still ships.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.880]   You can buy books or you can get the digital book and then you don't even have to interact
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.240]   with the paper book and you can start reading.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.200]   You probably wanted to, I don't know, start a podcast, start a YouTube channel.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   Guess what?
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   You got a cell phone.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.620]   Watch Cell Phone Start It and get started.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.720]   You probably wanted to go to school.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.400]   One of the greatest things that's going to happen is a boon in distance learning.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   Right now you could sign up at about any university and take online classes and that's going to
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.480]   be a big opportunity right now.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.040]   So think about ways that you can do some things you wanted to do.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   You probably wanted to hang out with your children.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.680]   You probably wanted to, you're thinking about a family vacation.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.000]   Well take the family vacation but go to a national park instead of going to a theme
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.480]   park.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.080]   Go camping instead of going to a theme park or going to the places that are full.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.880]   Take everyone to the beach and go play in the water instead of going to downtown and
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.040]   find something you can do.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.480]   You can do that kind of stuff without interacting with a lot of other people.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.120]   So buy some board games and invest in time with your children.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.080]   I've always thought, what if I went to prison?
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   What would I do?
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.720]   I thought, okay, pretend Joshua, you get sent to prison for 10 years.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.840]   What would you do?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.520]   And I've often thought, well, I'd get a PhD.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   Here's all these things.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.520]   I'd get super fit.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.080]   I'd be jacked and playing basketball all day.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   I mean, so just think about that.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   What if you went to prison?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.360]   In this case, the prison is your home.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.840]   You got a chance to hang out there.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   Maybe you write.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   Write a book.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   Write a novel.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   Do something.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   There are ways to do from it.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.300]   We'll talk in the days to come about the economic effects, about ways to profit from it as those
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.720]   things start to emerge.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.600]   I'm not confident at this point.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.000]   I think we're just at the very beginning and it's going to be a long, slow road.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.520]   Those are my thoughts.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.840]   I hope it helps you in some way.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.080]   Pay attention to the news.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.480]   Pay attention to the risks.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.080]   Keep your head on straight.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   Don't freak out, but don't stick your head under the rock either.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.200]   At the very least, pay attention to the human psychology because that's what you're seeing
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:24.120]   right now is in some ways the very predictable human psychology of panic and groupthink.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.680]   It's making a difference.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.440]   Talk to you soon.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.240]   Your tough Tacoma is here.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.640]   Your powerful 4Runner.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.120]   Your stylish Camry.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.440]   Your versatile RAV4.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.160]   Even your fully electric VZ4X.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.440]   Your new Toyota car, truck or SUV is available now.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.300]   So see your Toyota dealer today.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.000]   We make it easy.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Toyota.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.040]   Let's go places.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.100]   you
