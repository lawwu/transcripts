[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from Financial Samurai and we want to wish you a Happy New Year!
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Happy New Year!
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So in this episode, we just want to recap 2022 and also talk about our goals for 2023.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So I thought maybe you should start first and share what are some things you really liked and disliked about 2022.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Well, I felt like 2022 was a tough year for the first six months. We were really, really focused on your book.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And we were under a lot of pressure, a lot of stress. We wanted it to be a great success and we hadn't felt that amount of anxiety in a while.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And I think all of it paid off immensely. It was so exciting to see the whole process from start to finish.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And when it finally came out, when you finally got to hold it in your hands the first time, how exciting was that?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It was pretty exciting. Buy This, Not That started in 2020, early 2020.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And it was a way for me to say, well, screw the pandemic, screw suboptimal times. I'm going to make the most out of it.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Which is something that I've really wanted to do. And what I've been doing, that's kind of been my mindset since I was a kid.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   When I sprained my ankle, I just say, screw you, ankle, I'm going to play anyway. And long term, actually, that might not be a good idea.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But that was that. Yeah, first half of the year was difficult. Did I feel anxious? I know.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yes, you did. I don't know if I felt anxious about the book editing process.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   No, that was my stress. Yeah, I was more anxious about the book marketing.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Because, you know, one of my goals in 2022 was to get on podcasts and do live TV interviews, which I actually did.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And those live TV interviews, if you've never done them, which I'm assuming most have not, is the hardest and most stressful thing.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Because you only have between one to maybe four minutes, probably only like two or three minutes to say something.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So you got to be succinct. You got to be precise. You can't stumble on your words. Yeah, there's no retakes.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   There's no retakes. So, you know, just interesting in marketing or having a conversation, doing a 30 minute or an hour long interview is so much easier than being put on the spot for one minute to three minutes.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The other thing I didn't realize about the first half of 2022 was how much time I spent dealing with my contractor to remodel our previous primary residence, which was a fixer that we bought in 2019.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Yeah, that was so painful. Man, I just I just cannot ever remodel, do a gut remodel ever again.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's so stressful. It's not worth it. And because it took so long and it cost more as usual, I think fully remodeled homes going forward are going to be more valuable.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   People are going to appreciate it more. People are going to pay up for them because it's just so hard to get permitting, to get approval.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Materials these days. Gosh. Yeah, materials boomed. Well, now then they busted everything.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Well, labor costs are up as well. So if you can find a fully done house, I would look for that.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I would not take on a remodel project unless you're in your 20s or 30s without children.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Or if you're only trying to do one room, which is still hard, but easier than trying to do an entire house.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, I mean, one room. No problem. Just do some paint, change some fixtures.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's easy. But yeah, doing one kitchen, four bathrooms or however many. No, three bathrooms.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We did three bathrooms. We gutted the ground, added square footage. Yeah, it was a lot.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   But here's the thing, though, like all hard things, it it feels worth it at the end.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   You know, the good thing I have a saying, the good thing about hard work is that it's over and we get to reap the rewards for hopefully years and years to come.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah. So what are some of your highlights and lowlights of last year?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, besides the remodel and besides the release of the book, Buy This, Not That, which became a instant Wall Street Journal bestseller, pretty proud of that,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   was running in place with the wealth creation. It was kind of depressing.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Let's just be frank. Stock market closed down almost 20 percent, the S&P 500 down 20 percent, pretty much giving up all its gains in 2021.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So I felt like I was running in molasses. 30 percent of our net worth was exposed to stocks, which is down 20 percent, which meant that our net worth declined by 6 percent.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Now, we ended up with a flat net worth only because of passive income savings and online income.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So in other words, I think you can see that as a positive or negative.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   The first rule of financial independence is not lose money, because if you lose money, you lose time.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So this way, we didn't really lose time and we have all the time in the world because we don't have day jobs.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But on the negative, it's basically we worked kind of for free.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   All the hours that I spent working on Financial Samurai, writing the book, editing the book, marketing was for nothing.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I don't say that.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Let's just be frank. I think in finance, we got to be real.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   The only positive thing I did at the end of 2021 was reduce our asset allocation to stocks from 35 percent to 30 percent.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Because 2021 was crazy and my long term asset allocation goal is to have 25 to 30 percent in stocks.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But I did experience something pretty great and that was health wise.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So in spite, in spite of losing a lot of money in the stock market, my health improved.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   My shortness of breath issues cleared away and I also lost five pounds.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So what this tells me is that I have the proper asset allocation and I'm satisfied with the money we have.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You know how some people, they say, oh yeah, we're good, we're good.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But then, you know, maybe in the background, they're like working as hard as ever to make way more money.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Or they say, you know, they feel no pain, but deep down, they feel tons of pain.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So I think one of the things about our bodies is that it doesn't lie to us.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's like an honest child that tells us the truth no matter what.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It reflects how we are feeling stress wise and more.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Another thing I'm really proud about is doing all this dad stuff.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Daddy moments.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Our son graduated from preschool.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So proud. We've got such a great picture of him graduating with his cap and gown.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And also teaching him how to ride a bike on November 13, 2022.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   After seven sessions, he finally did it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And the hardest thing was actually letting go.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Oh.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   You know, I basically ran behind him holding his shoulders or holding his neck, hurting my back in the process.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Nonstop, just running, running, running.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It's hard. I tried it too.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I was like, "Well, I'm glad that you did most of the work."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But I made a commitment to do 16 sessions once a week for 16 weeks.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   By the end of the year, he would ride a bike and he did it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And his joy and the smile on his face was priceless.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I was there to capture that video.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So those are the moments where we just think, you know, money stuff is important.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   But so long as you have enough money to, you know, feel relatively comfortable, to do what you want, it's all this other stuff that is truly priceless.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So how about you? What are some highlights of your 2022?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Well, one thing that comes to mind is something that happened just a few weeks ago is we finally got my mom to come visit us.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It took forever to convince her to come.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Like she's been wanting to come for a long time and, you know, something would always come up, some excuse.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And then she finally decided that she wanted to come for Christmas.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And so we started to plan out the trip.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And then she changed her mind.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   She said, "Oh, I can't come."
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And then I convinced her to come again.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And it was so much back and forth.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And about four days before she was supposed to arrive, she said, "I can't come."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And I had to pull out all the stops, convince her that she really needed to come.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And thank goodness she did.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   We had an amazing week with her.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And then there were all the crazy flight cancellations that were happening on the East Coast like a day or two before she was supposed to fly home.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And thankfully, everything went smoothly.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   She didn't have any delays.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   She got all the way back home safe.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   So that was kind of a highlight, you know, the biggest highlight at the end of the year for me.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Right.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   To get, you know, getting her out here to see the kids and us.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah, it had been three years.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And before that, during Thanksgiving, I got my parents to come out.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And so they hadn't come out in three years as well since our daughter was born.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so it was really good to see family.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   That's the one biggest downer about the pandemic is fear and uncertainty and distance from family.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   What else?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Another one that comes to mind is we had some great family vacations, which reminds me that we paid off our vacation property mortgage.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   This was our Lake Tahoe vacation property mortgage we bought in 2007.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Bad timing.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's been an albatross on my neck.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   But we got a good deal relative to 2006 prices.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   But then prices kept on going down.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   However, since our kids were born, we've been able to take them and fulfill our dream of having children enjoy the water slides and pool and so forth.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So paying down that mortgage.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Yeah, we finally did.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   15 years.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   There was about 50,000 left at the beginning of 2022.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   The mortgage rate was 4.25%, which was the highest mortgage we had out of our mortgages.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But now it doesn't look that high, right? With average 30 year fixed at around 6.2%, maybe.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But it still feels great, folks, to pay off your mortgage.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   What's most interesting is our cash flow has gone way up.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So the mortgage used to be $2,500 a month.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And predominantly, most of it was paying off principal since we only had 50,000 left.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And it's been 15 years.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But by paying it off, you, we now have 2,500 more a month in cash flow, which is, what is that, 30,000 a year.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And also, weren't you tacking on automatic $1,000 a month to principal?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yeah, extra.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So that's $3,500 a month in cash flow.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I'll talk about this in a future post.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Because this feels really good.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It's not just paying off the mortgage.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's like, ah, we got all this cash flow to do what we want.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We can reinvest that money.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   We could spend it.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And so forth.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So, yeah, you know, there's a whole debate on paying off your mortgage or not.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I follow the FSDARE method, basically allocating a certain percentage based on the interest rate.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So if the interest rate is 4.25%, I would allocate 42.5%, so times that by 10, right, towards paying off debt and then the rest towards investing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   But I've never regretted paying off a mortgage.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Or paying down extra principal.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It just feels good.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It just feels good, especially during times of uncertainty.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   So a lot of people poo-poo paying down debt, you know, let's say at the beginning of 2022.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   But if you pay down even 0% rate debt, you outperform the S&P 500 by 20% because that's how much the S&P 500 went down.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So something to think about for 2023 and beyond.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Alright, so overall, I would give 2022 a B+.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   We didn't make any money, but we progressed in terms of our health and our family.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   What would you give 2022 in terms of a grade?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   For myself, probably like a B-, I felt like I didn't do as much as I wanted the second half of the year, but I felt really good about the first half.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Alright, so let's move on to 2023 goals.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   What are some goals you have for this year?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is weight.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I know you have a goal about weight.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Mine is to shed a few pounds because I've been having a little bit of weight creep.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So what I'm going to do this year is get back into a regular exercise regimen.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And thanks to you, I am now playing pickleball.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   You are a pickleball addict.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I am a pickleball fanatic.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So I'm hoping, I won't be playing as much as you, but I'm hoping to play about two times a week.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And if I'm not, to just do some hiking around to just keep myself active.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   How about you?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Yeah, in terms of weight, I did finally lose that five pounds that I've been wanting to lose every year for the past five years.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And it was also due to pickleball.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And I don't have a weight loss goal.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I have a weight maintenance goal.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   At 45, it does feel a little bit harder to stay in shape.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   But I believe if I can play tennis and pickleball on average total four times a week and just eat in moderation,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I should be able to stay at 168 pounds at 5'10", which is totally fine for me.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I can still fit in all my clothes from the past 15, 20 years.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Although the ideal weight chart says I should be 151 to 163 pounds.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I mean, if I want to apply to be a Bowflex man model, a fitness model, I guess.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But this is not priority at my age.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I don't even know if a Bowflex model would weigh that little.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I mean, people are really skinny.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   These models, these fitness models.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I know several people who are 140 pounds at 5'10".
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Are you serious?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yeah, but like, you know, those cheapo.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Very, very lean.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Super lean, like all the actors and all that.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   When you meet them in real life, you're like, "Wow, you are super skinny."
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   It is really interesting.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   What else? What other goals do you have?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'll talk about another thing that comes to mind that you also spoke to as well is about parenting.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   We're trying to come to a more aligned parenting style,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   which I think you're going to write about in a future post, which will be a little bit of a teaser.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   You're a more tough love parent.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm a softer love parent.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And sometimes it can create a little tension where we each feel like we're being a little too, you know,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   far on one end of the scale than the other.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   So I'm going to try and do some tweaking with my parenting tactics and see if I can do a better job there.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Yeah, you know, folks, I grew up kind of in a tough love environment.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   My parents were always working.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   If I fell, they didn't help me up.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It was just the kind of grind on, grind on.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And I see the benefit of tough love because if nobody helps you, you've got to figure out a way to help yourself.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And I just fear raising kids that end up staying at home dependent on us well into their 30s because I see adult sons,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   adult sons in our neighborhood right now, at least five of them still living at home with their parents.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And the ages range from 26 to 34.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That is really worrying to me.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And I think there's like this issue if you do deeper research on boys versus girls in academics, in, you know, building wealth, all that.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And I have this fear.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Do you think this is a rational fear?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Well, I think it's rational based on what we're observing in the area.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I don't have the same level of anxiety that you do.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And I think it's because we have different personalities and different responsibilities.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But it's definitely something that we're going to look into further this year.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   So here's an example.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Let's say our son slips and falls after being told five times to not run on wet cement or a sidewalk.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So he's crying and he's just reaching out to us.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And I'll look at him and I'll say, "Embrace the pain.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Be cognizant of the pain.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   If you did not want to feel pain, you would not have run."
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And this is a philosophy, you know, that I've had for years.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And then I read this book called The Courage to be Disliked.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And it also has that same philosophy where it says, "If you want to basically," let's say, "If you want something, you're going to take action to get it.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And if you don't want something, you're not going to take action to get it."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I have this belief that everything is rational long term.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And we learn through pain.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We learn through failure.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   We learn through misery.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Because afterwards, everything gets that much easier.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I'm laughing because sometimes you tell our son, "You like the pain, don't you?" when he falls down.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Well, I'm trying to get into his head like, "Don't hit -- if you don't want to feel pain, don't do that."
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   It's very rational.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   But what do you say if he's crying?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I won't say those same words.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   But I'll usually remind him that this is why we were telling you to slow down because it's slippery.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Now do you see why you fell down?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You were going too fast.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And then I'll still, you know, ask him after I've kind of gotten that out, "Are you okay? Do you need some ice?"
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   No.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   No.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   No, nothing.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   What?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I mean, it's so funny.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   We're talking right now.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   We're actually recording this in our car.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And one of the adult sons is right behind us.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   He's got long, shaggy hair.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He's checking into his house right now.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   It's like noon.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Like, "Why aren't you working, dude?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Like, what's going on?"
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I have this great fear.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And I think part of this fear is because I have to provide --
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Unless he's secretly working from home.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   We don't know.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   No, I already talked to his father.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   He says he's lost.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   You know, he dropped out of school.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So did his daughter.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   You tell me, folks.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   What is going on?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Actually, I know what's going on.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   The world is crazy competitive.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Yes.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   It is so competitive that I wish all our youth good luck, love, and harmony.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Please take care of yourself.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Please develop good relationships.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Because it's -- I feel scared.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   It's like having interview skills is one thing, but I feel like so many people can't even get to the interview stage with the amount of competition that there is for jobs.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It's tough.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It's tough.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Like, any job you get is like winning the lottery.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And what I also realize is this.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I truly realized this after publishing my book.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   There are lots of quality works out there.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Quality people, quality employees, quality books, quality products.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   But only those that get lucky enough with the most amount of marketing budget and the most amount of attention get to the top.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Many, many thousands of people can replace the CEOs of great companies and still run them to the ground like they did in 2022.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   We are easily replaceable.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And I know you furred your brow because I was kind of making a joke.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   What I'm saying is that there are CEOs in 2022 that got paid tens of millions of dollars, but they still saw their share prices go down 20 to 70%.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I can do that just as well as they can.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   What I'm saying is that you've got to be lucky.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Not only do you have to be good, you've got to be lucky to be embraced, to be recognized, to get ahead in this world.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And one of the reasons why I'm still focused on academics, good work ethic, building a rental property portfolio, and maintaining a small business is because just in case our kids don't get into a university because of their identity,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   don't get a job because they couldn't get a good university and they don't have the connections,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   we will be an insurance policy that hopefully is never needed to make them survive and get them out of the house.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   What are the goals do you have for 2023?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Well, for listeners here, you'll be pleased to know that I plan to record at least 30 more episodes in 2023.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I think it's fun to connect with y'all and share new stories and bring in comment feedback.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   That's always great because it's about a community of financial samurai.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Also, did you know that the Financial Samurai podcast has now achieved over 1 million downloads?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Oh my God, that's huge.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Yeah, we started in about 2017 regularly, haven't been promoting it, haven't gotten any advertisers, try to get straight to the point.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But yeah, we've got 1 million downloads as of early 2023.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Fantastic.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So maybe we can, I don't know, grow to 1.5 million by the end of 2023.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Generally, what happens is you build upon something for a while, for a while, and then eventually you see a hockey stick up and then that extra growth comes quicker.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   One of the challenges I had for 2022, because we were writing the book and doing the remodeling and raising kids,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   was would I have the motivation to continue to record without any advertisers?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And I have to say, I was totally motivated inherently to do so without any advertisement dollars.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I recorded over 43 podcasts, maybe 45, and it was fun.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Drop off our son at school, come to the driveway and record a 10 to 20 minute episode.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   And it worked.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   But I will say for 2023, I want to take things down a notch.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I wrote before that I've been publishing three times a week since 2009.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   But that's not the reality.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I've been publishing more than, more like four times a week since 2009 because I have a weekly newsletter that comes out every Sunday morning.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And you can subscribe at financialsamurai.com/news so you don't miss a thing.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And because of this newsletter, I've had to often, actually every single weekend, work either Friday night, Saturday morning, or Sunday morning to write and edit it.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And then I've got to send it to you or my dad to edit it.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   So that's not fun because I never get a weekend off.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Right.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I have to really be inspired.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And yeah, I was pretty inspired to write my newsletters.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   But I will admit about 15% of the time, I didn't want to write it at all.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   But that's one of the things.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   When you set out public goals, you are held accountable.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   You just want to do it and not let people down.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So I'm trying to manage expectations for 2023.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And maybe I'll just publish two times a week and a newsletter.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So that's still three times a week.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And if I'm still publishing a podcast, that's still a lot.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   It's kind of like anti-minimalism.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I noticed in the past, I would publish three times a week.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I'm good.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I was good.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Then I would do three times a week plus a newsletter.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And then three times a week plus a newsletter plus two podcasts.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And then I would write a page because I needed to update some kind of factual page.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   It adds up.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   It's like endless clutter.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I wouldn't call it clutter.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   It's work.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Yeah, it's endless work that just never stops when you have the ability to do what you want.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So I'm a highly motivated person, so I just keep on going.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But I need to throttle that back for happiness, sanity, and health.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   All right.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Well, in conclusion, 2023 is all about going back to the early retirement lifestyle to lead a more simple, healthier, and happy life.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   In a bear market, which we are still in, it doesn't make sense to grind so hard because your return on effort is lower.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   The time to grind is during a bull market.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   For example, can you imagine working 60 hours a week and then seeing your stock price decline by 50% in 2022?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I mean, what a waste of time.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   That would piss me off.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   It's frustrating.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So I really believe that when it's harder to make money, you shouldn't spend as much time making money.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   You should actually spend more time cultivating the things that matter more than money, like your friends' experiences.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Experiences and family.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   The opportunity cost of making money is lower, so you might as well spend that time enjoying life more.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   All right, folks.
