[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.400]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.320]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.040]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.720]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.320]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.540]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.200]   this homeschooling possibility or deep into
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.160]   the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.960]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.480]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.160]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.540]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.560]   Well, listeners, welcome and happy new year.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.060]   Happy January.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.800]   It is cold at my house right now.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.960]   I am actually looking forward to some snow
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.120]   and maybe you guys are too, wherever you are,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   wherever you're listening to this podcast.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.200]   Snowy days are great times to hunker down
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.280]   and be inside with your family
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.120]   and have some great conversations
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.460]   and some hot chocolate and some read along.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080]   And, hey, maybe even play some memory games.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160]   I've noticed on our Facebook page
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.040]   over the last couple of weeks
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   that there have been lots of families
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.160]   who have started thinking about Memory Master.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.040]   As our foundation's year draws to a close,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.640]   a lot of families are thinking,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.920]   hey, maybe my child really could be a Memory Master
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.680]   or what are some ways for us to practice
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   all this memory work we've spent all these hours pursuing
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.240]   and filing away this year?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.520]   So I grabbed my good friend, Kelly Wilt,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.320]   and we want to talk to you today
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.440]   about Memory Master tips, tricks, and fun.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.000]   Kelly, you are just the girl for this.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   - Oh, Lisa, you know I can talk about Memory Master anytime.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   And for anyone who's listening at home,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760]   maybe your family has made a new year's resolution
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.720]   to really emphasize practicing memory work at home together,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.640]   making it fun with the goal of Memory Master this cycle.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.040]   And I will say, it is not too late for you to do that.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120]   - Absolutely not.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.920]   - So this is a well-timed podcast
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.820]   and hopefully it will encourage some friends
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.320]   who are contemplating whether or not
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   this is doable for 2025.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.600]   - That's really good.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.440]   But you know what?
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.600]   One thing that you said at the beginning,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.240]   I really kind of want to emphasize,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.800]   even if your family is brand new to CC
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.280]   and you just kind of dipped your toe into it this year
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.720]   and you're just kind of taking a let's sit back
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.680]   and see how it goes.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   And Memory Master is not something
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   that tricked your trigger, tripped your trigger,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.120]   and you don't really want to do that.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.480]   This is still a great podcast for you
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   because we're going to be talking about
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   how you and your family can practice memory work together
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   and the benefits that you will get may have nothing to do
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.660]   with becoming a Memory Master in community.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.160]   - It's so true.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.720]   There is so much more to the Memory Master process
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.560]   and becoming a Memory Master
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.760]   than solely committing facts to memory and reciting them.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.520]   - Yeah, and it's not about a competition.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.840]   Okay, in fact, let's just, if somebody, Kelly,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.120]   if somebody came up to you and asked you just off the cuff
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.800]   to explain Memory Master, what would you say?
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.360]   What is it that you think is the most important aspect
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   to convey to somebody who's curious?
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.240]   - That's a really good question, Lisa,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   because as homeschooling families,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   a lot of times we love to talk about
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.040]   the things that we're doing
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.440]   and the things that we're involved in.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.360]   And if you're speaking to someone
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.160]   who doesn't have intimate knowledge
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   of classical conversations,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.260]   they might wonder, what is a Memory Master?
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.680]   Why is it a big deal?
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.520]   So a Memory Master, the title Memory Master
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.800]   is an honor that's given to our foundation students
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.320]   who mastered all of the memory work subjects
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.120]   for the current cycle of that academic year.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.600]   And of course, that includes all the memory work
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.000]   for history and geography and English grammar
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and Latin and math and science.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.400]   And of course, our beloved timeline.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.680]   - Yes.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.340]   - They're able to recite all of that to their parents
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.260]   and then to another adult
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.840]   and then to their foundations tutor
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   and finally to their director.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.520]   And I think one of the things that is difficult
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.240]   for people outside of CC to comprehend
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   is the vast amount of information
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.880]   that our foundation students master
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.700]   over the course of a cycle.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.800]   And for some families coming into CC,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.680]   that can feel a little intimidating at first.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.080]   I remember here, when I first heard
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.960]   about classical conversations,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.080]   and I mean, I was so green.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.920]   I didn't know what a cycle was.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   I didn't know what a Memory Master was.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.160]   I didn't know what a strand was.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.320]   And so when you're talking about for a cycle,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   that's the material for one community year.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.280]   So the time that your family has spent
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.080]   with this community this year, that's a cycle.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.600]   So all of that memory work.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.000]   And when I looked at how many pieces it was,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.240]   my girls were little.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.320]   They were like second grade and fifth grade.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.740]   And I thought, that seems like a little bit
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.000]   of craziness that you're talking to me right there.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.160]   Now, I quickly, I will, disclaimer,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.320]   I quickly discovered that it was only craziness for mama
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.960]   and that those little brains,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.080]   those little plastic brains absorbed that stuff really well.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.480]   But you're right.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.640]   It can seem intimidating when you say it out loud.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.720]   So how many pieces of memory work are we talking, friend?
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.840]   - Oh, Lisa, I wish I could give you an exact number.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.320]   I do know that our geographic locations alone,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.000]   number 120, individual locations.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.120]   - And that's one subject strand.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.800]   That's just geography.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.640]   - Exactly.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.460]   But you know what?
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.300]   You were so right.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.720]   Little brains can do great big things.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.360]   And it's natural.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.080]   - We teach them lots of songs and finger plays.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.280]   There are lots of good memory tricks
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.360]   that we use that allow our children
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.120]   to fold all of that material into their little brains.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.960]   Man.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.780]   - So true.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.360]   So true because they're curious about this memory work.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.900]   And when we present it to them in a way that is playful,
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.320]   it attaches to their memory
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   and it becomes a part of who they are.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.520]   And it's a wonderful thing
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.920]   to be walking down the aisle in the grocery store
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   and suddenly your children burst into the president's song.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.200]   Or they see those connections from their memory work
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.720]   in the world all around them.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.920]   And how rewarding is that?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.160]   Once those conversations start, what a blessing.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.200]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.360]   That is really cool.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   So it is about memorizing facts
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   that our children have been presented with
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.360]   all throughout the community year together
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.040]   in a bunch of different subjects.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   So that's what Memory Master is.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.980]   So why is it?
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.080]   'Cause I can tell that you love Memory Master.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.120]   And I know, I've always known
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.480]   that you were a Memory Master lover.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.720]   Why is it a great endeavor
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.880]   even if some of our listeners are kind of pulling back
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.480]   saying, you know, our family's not competitive
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.240]   or we don't want to be competitive with our learning.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.240]   Why is Memory Master still a great thing to be involved in?
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.440]   - Yeah, you know, I think one thing to be mindful of
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   as a parent is to understand that becoming a Memory Master
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   is not an on-off switch, that it really is a journey.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.600]   And it's a delightful journey
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.400]   because we take it one step at a time
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.500]   and we look at our children as individuals.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.280]   And Lisa, you know, when you said the word competitive
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.480]   it made me think about all of the C words
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.920]   that we have associated with classical conversations.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.120]   So, you know, as we're preparing for Memory Master
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.560]   there are some C words
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.240]   that I would encourage parents to pursue
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.440]   and to cultivate in their children.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.640]   And there are some C words that I would tell them to avoid.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.360]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.080]   Let's hear that 'cause that might help
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.120]   some of our on-the-fence parents
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.640]   see what this could be for them.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   So what are the Cs that we should strive for
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.660]   or that we should embrace?
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.360]   - Okay, so the first C word
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.280]   that I think you should strive for,
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   if you decide in 2025 to commit to practicing memory work
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.840]   is to be consistent.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.800]   And so, you know, and that truly is something
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.680]   that we want our children to be as well.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.200]   You know, as they're working through, you know,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.540]   their studies, we want them to be able to do hard things
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.680]   with consistency and to do them well.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.240]   So as parents, we have to be consistent
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.440]   in practicing the memory work with our children.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.080]   And I know, you know, we have snow potentially coming.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.340]   Tonight, I will tell you,
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.880]   I have adult children still living in our home.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.080]   We will put our pajamas on inside out
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.320]   and flush ice cubes as a tradition.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.120]   (both laughing)
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.880]   But snow days, those types of things
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.360]   are unique opportunities for you to be consistent
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.040]   in a wonderful way with your family.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   So the first C word that I would say to strive for
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.200]   is to be consistent.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.760]   You know, just do it, just consistently.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.960]   The second C word that I would say you need to strive for
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   in practicing memory work is to be creative.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   I mean, you know, we are dealing with children here
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.440]   and children, just like we adults,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.080]   don't want to simply sit in a chair
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.120]   and do everything in a monotone voice,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.440]   unless that's part of fun.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.800]   - Right, right, right.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.320]   Unless you're doing the robot version of memory work, yes.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.800]   - That's right, which does happen.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.880]   - It does.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.760]   - You know, we want to look for unique ways
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.280]   to plant those seeds of memory in our children's minds.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.480]   And sometimes we can do that by being goofy.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.800]   We can do that by moving our bodies,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.480]   by helping our children associate things
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.440]   with other things that they've already memorized or mastered.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.760]   There are so many ways that we can be creative
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.600]   to find the currency that our children need
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.680]   in order to commit these things to memory.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.760]   And, you know, for my own children,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.000]   I know I had two, at one point, two boys
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   who have now grown up into young men,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.400]   who, you know, what would make it stick
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.520]   was different for each of them.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.120]   - Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   - But there was one commonality that drew them together,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.360]   and that was their love of the Nerf gun.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   - I was gonna say, it's gotta be a sword or a Nerf gun.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.920]   Yeah, I can picture it.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   - Absolutely, so if I could find a way to involve a Nerf gun
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.200]   in the review of memory work, then it was going to stick.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.240]   So parents, you know, that's the wonderful thing
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.320]   about our children.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.520]   We can find those things that speak to them.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.320]   You know, maybe you have a ballet-loving daughter
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.280]   who wants to turn pirouettes as she skip counts.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.760]   - Oh my, that'd be awesome.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.520]   - Or you have a young man who is all about dinosaurs,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.160]   and you ask him to put the dinosaurs on the geography map
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.880]   and label, where's the Stegosaurus?
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.040]   Or, you know, where's the Brachiosaurus?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.880]   - Yes.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.880]   - Think outside the box and be creative with your children.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.040]   And the third one, I think, could possibly be
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.440]   the most important C, and that is to be celebratory.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.000]   So Lisa, you've already alluded to this a little bit.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   You know, when you look at,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.600]   when you come into Classical Conversations
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.920]   within the Foundations program,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.960]   you may look at this amount of information
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.160]   as being a little overwhelming your first year,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.760]   and that is totally understandable,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.720]   particularly if you do have a younger student
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.080]   who's participating, and you know,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   you wanna get your feet underneath you
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.960]   and really develop a fuller understanding
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.640]   of what is Foundations, why is this important?
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.040]   Why do we want to do this as a family?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.880]   But you know what?
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.760]   Even if you look at your child and you know,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.960]   this may not be the year to be a memory master,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.280]   your child can still be a subject star.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.640]   - That's a good idea, yeah.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.520]   - Maybe there's one subject, or two or three,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.760]   depending on how, you know,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.800]   what your child takes an interest in.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.120]   Maybe there are some subjects
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.440]   that you know they can commit to memory.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.320]   Maybe they sing the timeline song in the bathtub
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   and you can hear them through the door.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.000]   You know, maybe they really enjoy the history sentences,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.240]   and that is the thing that has captured their imagination.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.720]   Celebrate where you are and keep striving,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.320]   keep moving forward to your family goal.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.360]   And so celebrate whether or not your child
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.160]   is a subject star, or if your child is a memory master,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   or anything in between,
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.880]   because memory master itself is a fantastic goal
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.400]   for your foundation student.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.560]   Now, I also said, there are some C's we need to avoid.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.840]   - Before you tell us the avoiding things,
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.000]   I want to say what I really love
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.280]   about what you've already told us,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   is that none of this requires us to be competitive.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.440]   None of this requires us to be me against you,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.800]   or us against them.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.040]   What I love about all the things that you've told us
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   is that it is a way to draw your family closer together.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   - Yes.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.920]   - It's something that you can do with all of your kids,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.760]   and you and your spouse, everybody can do this together.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.200]   It's a great way to spend time together,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.000]   talking about things and playing together,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   having great conversations and common experiences.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.800]   So that, right there to me, that's worth it.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.880]   If there's anything that can draw your family
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.840]   into having fun together, we should pursue it.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.000]   So thank you for that.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.080]   - Now, tell us the C's we want to avoid
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.640]   so we don't put our foot in it.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.040]   - Okay, well, the first C that you definitely need to avoid
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   is almost the mirror opposite our first C to strive for.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.680]   We said we wanted to be consistent,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.160]   so we're gonna avoid being complacent.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.360]   And, oh, I'm telling you as a homeschooler,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.720]   I've homeschooled my children altogether
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.240]   for more than 20 years now, which is an incredible thing,
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.280]   but I'm telling you, there is something
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.920]   about the month of January into February
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   that can sometimes be the slump for us,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.000]   and we wanna avoid that.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.920]   As we're working on Memory Master,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.520]   avoid complacency at all costs.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.920]   So you're gonna have to look at this process
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   and practicing for Memory Master in new and different ways,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   and you're gonna have to sit in,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.440]   I hesitate to say sit in the chair,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.480]   but you're gonna have to commit to that way
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.320]   with your family and be consistent with what you do.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.080]   The second C to avoid is the opposite
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.720]   of our second C we want to strive for.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   You know, we said we wanna be creative,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.640]   so the opposite of that would be
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.480]   to avoid being constrictive.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.320]   And so, you know, when we talk about being creative,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.480]   we're thinking outside the box.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.760]   You know, being constrictive,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.000]   don't feel as if you always have to review memory work
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.640]   the same way, you know, look for different ways,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.760]   because perhaps the first way
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.680]   that you try to commit it to memory doesn't stick.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.720]   And, you know, after several rounds of that,
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.560]   and you've been consistent, and you've repeated,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.440]   and it's just not there,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.680]   it might be time to consider something different.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.800]   So don't constrict yourself
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.440]   to mastering the memory work the way that you began
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.240]   if it's not working for your family,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.560]   because you have the flexibility to change that,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.000]   like we said, according to the currency
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   that allows it to be mastered by your child at home.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.680]   And then-- - I love it,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.440]   'cause you can become Mary Poppins.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.400]   Snap, the job's a game, come on.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.720]   Let's just don't be so constrictive.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.760]   Yeah, and you know, for type A moms and dads,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.160]   it might be really hard.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.720]   Maybe one of the ways you're trying to avoid complacency
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.040]   is by being constrictive and doing it.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.120]   We're going to do it at this time
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.840]   for this amount of time, every day in this way,
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.240]   but that might kill the joy,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.280]   and snap, it will not be a game,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   and it will not be fun.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.120]   I love that.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.960]   Okay, got it.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.440]   So what's the third one?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.360]   I love that.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.720]   Well, and we said that our third C
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.040]   that we're striving for is celebratory.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.440]   And Lisa, you've already alluded to a quote
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.040]   that is so meaningful to me,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.200]   and it's a C.S. Lewis quote that says,
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.840]   "Comparison is the thief of joy."
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.560]   And you know, when we're celebrating,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.840]   we're joyful, we're exuberant.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.440]   We are so excited about what we're able
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.720]   to accomplish together as families.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.560]   And as a mom, sometimes it can be easy
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.040]   to look at one child and say,
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.480]   "Well, why can't you do this like your brother?
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.400]   "Why can't you do this like your sister?"
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.280]   Or even outside the family, you know,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.680]   "Why aren't you doing this like your friend so-and-so?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.920]   "You know, they're doing a great job."
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.640]   There's nothing that kills the joy
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.120]   of a foundation student more
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.560]   than being compared to another one.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.880]   Especially when you get the short end of that comparison.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.200]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.880]   So we want to maintain a joyful spirit
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.040]   by not comparing where we are to others.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.840]   And that also is a characteristic
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.040]   that we wanna cultivate in our children.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.120]   We want them to see themselves where they are
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.280]   and to continue on the path that's been laid before them,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.360]   not try to hop off their path onto someone else's path
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.600]   where they may be at a different place.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.680]   And we've all been given different giftings from the world.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   And so, you know, comparing one child to another
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.600]   is like comparing a fish that can swim
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.520]   to a fish that can ride a bicycle.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.080]   You know, it doesn't work out so well
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   for the fish who's trying to pedal with his fins,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.320]   but the fish that's in the water does a great job.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   So we want to be really careful
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.240]   that we're being celebratory of each of our children,
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   where they are and for what they're attempting to accomplish.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.480]   - That's really good, that's just really good.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.520]   And I think you have shown us a lot of ways
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   that there are real bonuses for Memory Master,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.200]   whether or not your child achieves mastery
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   in every subject, there are good habits being developed,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.160]   there are good family relationships being strengthened.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.680]   Any other bonuses of working on Memory Master
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.200]   that you can think of, Kelly?
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.440]   - Oh, I think just setting for our children an example
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.080]   that they can do hard things
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.800]   and that if they are consistent
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.040]   and they're thinking creatively
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.520]   and they're celebrating those steps along the way,
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.200]   that they can accomplish greater goals by doing that,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.000]   I think is such a wonderful skill for any student to have,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.280]   particularly before they move into challenge A and B
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.680]   and beyond, because they're going to encounter
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.440]   those growing edge opportunities in challenge.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   And if they already have built the mental muscle
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   to accomplish these goals of being a subject star
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.960]   or a Memory Master, then the mental lifting
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.840]   and the dedication that's required
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.680]   to do something consistently and do it well
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.120]   will seem familiar and will seem much lighter
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.560]   to their minds and to their hearts.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.520]   - Yeah, you know, I'm embarrassed to say
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   that I never really thought about the fact
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.960]   that our Memory Masters from foundations
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.800]   already have had modeled for them
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.680]   or they've already learned or they've already practiced
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.960]   ways to take a big job and break it into smaller chunks.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.600]   And so you're right, that is a beautiful skill.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.560]   They have already discovered
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.920]   that the best way to eat an elephant
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.320]   is one bite at a time.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.160]   The best way to memorize a bunch of stuff
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.480]   is to divide it into sections
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.280]   and work a little bit at a time.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.800]   That's the way you build a debate
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.000]   and that's the way you write an essay
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.480]   and that's the way you translate a chapter of the Bible.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.880]   You start with a word or a sentence and work out.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.960]   So that's really good, that is a great skill.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.800]   That's a great skill.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.880]   - Okay, so help us out here.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.080]   We are now all ready.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.560]   We are in, we see that it's a good thing for our family.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.440]   It's great to stretch our memory muscles
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.360]   even as old parents can get in on the fun
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.280]   and that's a great thing.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   So what are some of the fun ways
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.200]   that we can work on memorizing
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.360]   and mastering all those memories?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.960]   And I know review games are great
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.320]   and our tutors, foundations tutors do an amazing job
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.120]   of modeling those kinds of games on community day
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.960]   but what else is there?
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.160]   I mean, besides throwing the cards
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.960]   in the middle of the floor and saying,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.080]   I'm gonna start the stopwatch and you say help out.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.960]   What can we do?
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   What are some more fun things we can do to review?
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.320]   - Oh, this is one of my favorite things to talk about.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.840]   I'm so glad you asked this question.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.720]   So I would say primarily before we discuss fun ideas,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.560]   I would say this.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.720]   Parents, you are the first foundation student
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.800]   in your family.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.200]   So you need, and that is a hot take,
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   but you need commit yourself to mastering
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.440]   as much as you can.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.760]   And I know you may be listening and you may say,
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.640]   Kelly, that is a pipe dream.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.960]   And I am telling you, you can do it.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.720]   And lots of foundations parents do this on a yearly basis.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.400]   They will actually ask the director for permission to prove.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.640]   - That is so fun, I need to see this happening.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.800]   - It is, and you know what?
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.400]   I applaud those parents because not only are they setting
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.560]   an example for their children,
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.360]   that they too can do hard things.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   - Right.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.640]   - But they are also committing that information
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   to their memories so that those lovely organic conversations
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.360]   can happen while you're quote unquote in the wild
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.040]   with your family living life.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.200]   And having experiences together.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.600]   So parents, I'm telling you, you can do it.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.760]   Some fun ways to work on memorizing and mastering
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.560]   all of this information can be found in your very own home.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.840]   So I know a lot of times, you know, we look online
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.160]   and we think, oh, I have to print all these things,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.000]   or I have to make this game with the spinner
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.400]   and I have to do all this stuff.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.200]   Yeah, and so there's some crafty moms that are like,
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.320]   or non crafty moms that are like,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.920]   yeah, I'm not doing anything cute.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.080]   What else you got?
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.040]   - Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.560]   And I love going online and seeing how incredibly creative
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.960]   our foundation parents are because they found
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.880]   that that currency works for their particular child
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.840]   and they just want to share the yummy goodness
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.320]   that they have created with everyone else.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.160]   But I will say this, you don't have to print and laminate
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.760]   a lot of things in order to be successful
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.120]   in reviewing memory work at home.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.520]   So I will give you a few just inexpensive examples
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.880]   of things that you already have at home.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.440]   So here's one of them, you know,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.920]   I've already mentioned the Nerf gun
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   and families, more than likely, if you have a son,
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.240]   you have a Nerf gun.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.080]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.200]   - And I know there are a lot of Nerf gun loving girls
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   out there as well.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.800]   - Friends, I have to tell you this,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.000]   I have a Nerf gun beside my desk.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.480]   And so does my husband because when our girls were home,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.360]   we had, one of the things that we did together for fun
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.960]   was surprise each other.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.800]   And so they would come around the corner while I was working
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.640]   or while I was doing something
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.120]   and shoot me with the Nerf gun.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.480]   And so I now have one on the shelf right beside my desk
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.080]   and I could just grab it and you would never even know
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.320]   I was reaching for it.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.520]   - I love that, okay.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.400]   So Lisa, if you commit yourself to being a memory master,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.240]   here's a trick for you.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.440]   - I have my gun, okay.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.320]   - I love it.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.000]   So one of the things that I would do
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.360]   is I would take a dry erase marker
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.200]   and I would pull up the blinds
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.360]   and expose the glass in the window.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.280]   And I would draw a circle
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.920]   and divide it into pie sections with my marker
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.240]   and write one of the subjects of memory work
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.120]   in each of the pie slices.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   And I would have the boys stand back
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.480]   and I would be primed and ready
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.320]   with my foundation's curriculum.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.760]   And they would take their Nerf gun
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.640]   and they would draw aim and shoot it at that circle.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.520]   And whatever subject the dart landed in,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.400]   I would pull a question or something to review with them
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.960]   from that subject.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.440]   And it was just enough to be fun.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.040]   You know, it was something different to do together.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.520]   Now we would also utilize those Nerf guns
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.160]   because I loved having maps
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.240]   of our foundation's geography memory work on the wall
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.200]   for my guys and for my daughter.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.120]   And so, you know, we would pull those source four files
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.080]   that are so wonderfully available to our families
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.280]   and print them up.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.640]   And we would also fire the Nerf guns at the map
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   and they would name for me the location
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.840]   where the dart landed.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   And that was so much fun for them to do.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.920]   And you know, you can take just about anything in your home
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.840]   and make it into a game if you're creative.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.800]   Another thing that if you have a deck of cards
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.240]   and a hat or a pot,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.040]   what you can do is have your child stand in front of that
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.280]   and throw a card at the hat or at the pot.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.800]   If the card lands in the hat,
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.760]   then you ask them a memory work question.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.880]   If the card lands on the floor,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.720]   then they get a pass until they get one in the hat.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.040]   So they're shooting for the hat.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.160]   Now don't let them get away
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.000]   with throwing cards all over the room.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.800]   - Yes, I can see that devolving,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.200]   but you know, it might be worth it.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.040]   - That's right.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.480]   You may need to switch your strategy there
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.760]   based on what your child is able to do.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.960]   Doing things like that, rolling dice,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.880]   you know, and saying, okay, if you roll a one,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   I'm gonna ask you a question from week one.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.200]   If you roll a two, week two,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.920]   and utilizing those small types of things
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.040]   that are probably lurking in your home
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.280]   is a great way to make it fun.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.760]   And you know, the thing I love about this
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.840]   is all these things are already in your home.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.920]   Also look for opportunities that are free.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.480]   I know it's brisk outside here in North Carolina
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.840]   where I live right now,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.440]   but going on a walk and just reviewing memory work
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.080]   and saying, okay, at the stop sign,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.560]   we're gonna recite our skip counting.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.640]   You know, around the corner
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.480]   when we get to our neighbor's house,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.520]   we're gonna recite our history sentence.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.120]   Doing that and going on walks keeps you active,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.760]   but it also commits the information to memory
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.920]   because then you can say,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.320]   do you remember what we said
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.000]   when we were in front of the stop sign?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.160]   - Kind of like a memory palace, yeah.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.360]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.280]   And in the winter months,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.920]   sometimes we just need to get up and get moving as we can.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.800]   Now for listeners who are perhaps living in areas
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.440]   where there may be snowfall,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.000]   that may look a little different for you.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.200]   That may look like, you know,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.000]   a brisk march throughout the house instead.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.160]   - Or up and down the stairs
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.960]   if you have any steps in your house.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.720]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.840]   And one of the things that I love
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.520]   is hearing each year tips and tricks
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.600]   from our National Memory Master families
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.360]   who participate in the National Memory Master competition.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.080]   And one thing that goes without fail,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.800]   every year I will have a family
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.920]   that will talk about the timeline cards
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.800]   and memorizing the timeline
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.080]   and how they do that in unique ways.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.920]   - I love it.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.160]   - So like what you just described before,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.440]   you know, putting the cards on the floor
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.720]   and saying, okay, you've got 30 seconds.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.840]   You know, do what you can.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.560]   A lot of our families will place the timeline cards
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.320]   either going up a staircase or down a hallway
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.800]   and that student will walk down the hall
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.560]   or go up the stairs and they will tap each card
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.040]   and recite the timeline event.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.800]   And so it gets the child moving, you know,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.760]   but they're also remembering the order, the sequence,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.040]   which is so important for timeline particularly
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.880]   for those cards.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.760]   So you can do that anywhere.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.080]   You can put them around your kitchen.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.160]   You can put them in your dining room.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.400]   You know, just make sure you,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.360]   if you put them in your kitchen and adhere them to the wall
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.560]   so they don't fall into a pot of spaghetti sauce.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.400]   - Yes.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.240]   - Or something like that.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.280]   - It's not important to a parent, yeah.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.560]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.640]   But utilize what you have
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.440]   and really challenge yourself to think about
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.400]   the tools that you have in your home
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.720]   and using them in different ways.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.440]   Have your daughter, if she loves baby dolls,
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.520]   have her be the tutor
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.920]   and, you know, recite her memory work for her baby dolls.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.560]   Or, you know, there are different things like that
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.760]   that you can do that are fun,
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.840]   particularly if the parent pretends they're one of the dolls
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.120]   and they also are reciting the memory work.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.520]   - Yes, I can remember reciting memory work
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.680]   and we would do different voices.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.240]   We would do different accents.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.840]   Like the British accent.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.120]   - I love it.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.000]   - You know, we would have,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.640]   we would try for a Jamaica accent
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.680]   or we would try for an Italian accent
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.400]   or a down in the country accent.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.920]   You know, all kinds of stuff.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.040]   And it just made, it made it fun, okay?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.240]   It gave us something to laugh about.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.120]   - Yes.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.320]   You know, memory work sometimes, you know,
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   when people first hear what we do
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   and they don't understand our why,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.960]   they don't understand the goals of memory master.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.320]   They can sometimes think that,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.960]   oh, how boring, how sad.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.040]   They're just sitting in a chair and reciting things
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.080]   they've memorized.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.640]   Oh, and what I'm going to tell you is,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.280]   friends, we, that is not how we commit things to memory.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.240]   You know, we move our bodies
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.200]   and we connect the motion of our bodies to our mind.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.000]   - Especially kids.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.360]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.040]   So take opportunities to let your children move,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.240]   to do, think of things in fun, new, creative ways
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.880]   because then you'll never get tired of it.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.800]   You'll always be thinking together
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.760]   of something fun and new
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.280]   to do together as a family to have fun.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.800]   So this is just some of the ways
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.880]   that I can think of off the top of my head.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.400]   But, you know, I would be curious to see, you know,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.680]   if families think of fun, unique ways
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.840]   that they want to practice the memory work.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.080]   I mean, please write our National Memory Master Team.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.760]   The email address is nmm@classicalconversations.com
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.280]   because we would love to hear the way
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.040]   that you are practicing memory work at home.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   - That would be so, that'd be really fun
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.840]   to have a big across the United States
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.680]   or even there may be listeners around the world
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.480]   that want to tell us some of their memorizing tips.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.280]   We'll take it from everybody.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.920]   I wonder, Kelly, is there any,
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.080]   and I think I know the answer to this,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.120]   but is there any, you know,
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.400]   is there any guideline about,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.360]   well, in order to successfully create,
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.480]   to complete memory master,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.360]   your child needs to memorize this many math facts
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.200]   and this many geography facts
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.640]   and this many history sentences every 10 days
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.360]   in order to get, is there anything strident like that?
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.560]   Is there a, is there a,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.400]   some kind of schedule that people should be following
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.000]   or do we just do this for the love
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.920]   of knowledge and fellowship?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.160]   - Lisa, this is a tricky question
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.920]   because there are some people who are going to say,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.520]   absolutely, there's a schedule
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.440]   and you review week one when you get to week seven
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.360]   and you review week two when you get to week eight.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.200]   And you know what?
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.120]   I would say the best answer I could give
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.080]   is that as parents, we have a tremendous liberty
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.920]   to do what works for our children.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.560]   - Yay, the liberty answer.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.760]   - You know, if working on a schedule,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.840]   if you are a busy, busy mama
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.400]   and that guideline in your head of,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.080]   okay, when we get to the second six weeks,
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.560]   we're gonna learn the new work,
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.520]   but we're gonna also review from that week
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.680]   in the first six weeks,
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.000]   you know, whatever guideline helps you to be consistent
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.280]   and creative and celebratory, go for it.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.560]   - Yes, if you can have a schedule
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.160]   that doesn't feel constrictive, you know,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.600]   and that doesn't, and it helps you to avoid complacency,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.920]   then I think that's a great thing.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.520]   And if you can have a schedule that you put up
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.800]   and you follow in a way
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.000]   that your children are excited about it.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.040]   For instance, if you make a giant racetrack
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.080]   that goes all the way across your kitchen
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.000]   and your dining area, and you just move,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.280]   your children move their race car as they practice material,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.880]   that's a schedule, but that's fun to them.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.240]   And so I love what you said.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.560]   I think that that's the key, the liberty.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.040]   You know the nature of your own children
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.880]   and parents, you know your own nature.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   What do you need to keep you helping your children
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.640]   to stay consistent so that they're not disappointed
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.840]   that their goal passed without them noticing it
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.720]   because of inconsistency or lack of plan.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.560]   - Absolutely.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.400]   - I think that's kind of fun.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.080]   - Absolutely, I completely agree.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.920]   - Completely agree.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.200]   And I would say this, you know, the level of,
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   I guess the amount of "scheduling" that you need to do
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.040]   may change as your child progresses through foundations.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.280]   - Well true, and it might change
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.720]   with what your child gets eager to do.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   I mean, a five-year-old is gonna have
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.320]   a different kind of interest in all of this
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.080]   than a fifth grader.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.800]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.320]   And the wonderful thing is some of our subject matter
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.000]   is repeated for each cycle.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.240]   So once your child masters math facts,
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.600]   not only skip counting, but the facts themselves,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.160]   the multiplication facts,
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.360]   and they've memorized the timeline,
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.880]   those are two subjects that repeat from cycle to cycle.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.080]   So it will just be a review.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:04.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.320]   It will just be a review for them,
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.200]   whereas they'll be taking in new information
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.520]   for some of the other subjects for that particular cycle.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.320]   So it's a great thing because it teaches them that,
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.560]   you know, we're always learning new information.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   - And we're practicing our old information.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.680]   Yeah, I love that, I love that.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.160]   Okay, last question here.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   I remember when my girls, when we got involved with CC,
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.200]   and they were, you know,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.920]   they were a little older than some kids are.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   Like I said, they were second grade and fifth grade.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.720]   And when they went for Memory Master the first time,
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.760]   I can remember having girlfriends who said,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.920]   "Oh, we would go somewhere."
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.120]   And they would say,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.280]   "Let your kids show that thing that they do,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.920]   "that memorizing thing."
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.880]   And it was just like they were a circus act or something.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.120]   It was sort of like my friend's favorite parlor trick
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.480]   to trot my kids out and show all these things
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.640]   that they could memorize.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.880]   But Memory Master and Memorize,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.680]   even Memory Master or Subject Memory Master
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.200]   is really more than just a parlor trick.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.960]   'Cause I remember thinking,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.760]   I don't really want them to see that,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.360]   I don't want them to think that learning is just a trick
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   or something to be admired.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.680]   There needs to be something
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.360]   that they're getting out of this.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.480]   And of course, I realized that they were,
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.520]   that there were things and they did learn things.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.120]   And we've touched on it a little bit,
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.440]   but Kelly tells what skills are being built
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.480]   as we pursue Memory Master
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   and what long-term benefits are our families accruing?
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.320]   - Oh, that's a fantastic question
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   because why are we doing this?
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.440]   We're not doing this because we want our children
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.440]   to be on a late night talk show doing human tricks.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.920]   Although I will say our eldest majored in pre-law
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.840]   and in one of his government classes,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.160]   the professor asked, "Does anyone here know the presidents?"
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.440]   Well, he raised his hand and recited the presidents
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.000]   in his college class, so it does not go away.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.040]   And the wonderful thing is based on the path
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   that he's chosen for his life,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.560]   he began to attach knowledge
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.480]   to the administrations of each president.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.160]   So it was really helpful for him.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.640]   But to answer this question,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.520]   what are the skills and what are the long-term benefits?
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.120]   Our brains are incredible gifts from God.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.080]   He's given us the ability to look at the world around us
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.560]   and to perceive and to commit to a library of the mind,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.240]   the things that we experience in this world,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.960]   and to be able to see relationships
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.800]   between all those pieces of information
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.200]   and make judgments based on what we have perceived
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.840]   in this world and what we know to be true, capital T,
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.680]   because he is truth, capital T.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.080]   And so I think when I think about Memory Master,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.160]   some of the long-term benefits that it brings,
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.400]   first of all, it provides a fantastic foundation
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.120]   of learning, a great framework for our students
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.200]   to move forward in their education with.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.120]   And so they're memorizing basic information
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.840]   about these individual subject areas
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.120]   that as they, like I said with our son,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.160]   as they move forward with their educations
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.960]   and they begin to read more,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.120]   and they begin to discuss more,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.960]   and they begin to contemplate,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.440]   they're gonna be attaching different pieces of information
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.640]   to that framework.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   And even more so, they're going to be reasoning
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.400]   and making judgments based on the framework
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.760]   that they've built, that library of the mind
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.200]   that they have constructed.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.840]   And as parents, what a gift from God
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.120]   that we are the first librarians,
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   the first curators of that library of the mind.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.240]   And what a wonderful thing to commit to memory,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.840]   these foundations facts that will help to provide
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.720]   that foundational framework for our children
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.440]   as they move forward.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.760]   It's definitely not a parlor trick,
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.920]   but it is pretty amazing to think
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.280]   that they're gonna be moving through the reading of novels
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.080]   with a framework of historical timeline
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.720]   to know where to place those individual works,
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.040]   that they're gonna be moving
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.840]   into deeper mathematical studies,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   having mastered multiplication facts and formulas and laws,
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.720]   that they're going to be writing essays,
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.440]   having a knowledge of the parts of speech
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.760]   and definitions of each of those parts of speech
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.400]   and so on and so on.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   There is a wonderful preparation that comes through memory,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.880]   because when our children are young,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.720]   that is exactly what they delight in.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.480]   They delight in the memory and the repetition
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.040]   and the mastery of these facts
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.080]   that will eventually become puzzle pieces
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.560]   that they put together in their minds,
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.320]   and then present forward to the world
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.960]   with a goal of knowing God
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.320]   and being able to make Him known.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.560]   And that is our ultimate goal, right?
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.680]   That they're memorizing these things,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.640]   that they are building a framework in their mind
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.680]   for God's world around them.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.360]   So that when they come forth
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.640]   and they speak about Him in the world,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.160]   that there already is such a vast information
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.240]   of who He is and how they see Him.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.520]   Now that is definitely something worth mastering.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.040]   - Yes, oh, that's great.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.480]   And that is a very heartening message for us as parents.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.720]   That gives us the why we should do this.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.640]   That's a great, that's a rally cry.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.960]   Thank you, Kelly, for that.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.600]   And thank you for these good ideas,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.280]   these tips, tricks, and ways to have fun
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.960]   with Memory Master that you have offered us today.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.280]   Families, I hope that you have been encouraged.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:25.160]   I would say that this is a fun endeavor for your family
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.680]   and keep it a fun endeavor for your family.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.640]   If it becomes drudgery or tear-inducing,
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.960]   something's gone awry.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.360]   And so keep it a fun family activity.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.600]   And if you are interested
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.960]   in seeing what a Memory Master can become,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.600]   Kelly alluded to the National Memory Master Competition.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.720]   And in a month or so, we will have another show
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   specifically about preparing for National Memory Master.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.120]   But if you're just curious
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.360]   and you would like to see the Memory Master Competition,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   it is part of the National Commencement Weekend
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:22.320]   that is put on by Classical Conversations Foundation.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.280]   You can mark your calendar now
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.800]   for the 2025 National Commencement.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.160]   Will be May 16th and 17th of this year
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.120]   in sunny Southern Pines.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.240]   It is a great time for CC families from around the nation
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.720]   to celebrate together with fellow homeschoolers
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.120]   who are on this homeschooling journey.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.960]   There's a welcome night for grads and their families.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.840]   There's a Q&A time.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.880]   You can get time with Lee and with Robert,
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.000]   and you can see the National Memory Master Championship.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.920]   So if you are interested
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.200]   or if you have a student graduating in 2025,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.440]   begin now to plan to join us in North Carolina
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.800]   for that weekend.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   Again, those dates are May 16th and 17th of 2025.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.920]   Registration is open now.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.400]   You can learn more about this
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.240]   at classicalconversationsfoundation.org.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.480]   And we will look forward to seeing your family there,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   I hope.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.960]   Kelly, again, thank you for sharing your wisdom
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.920]   and your enthusiasm with us today.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.320]   - Absolutely, Lisa.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.520]   And if you're listening,
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.720]   whether your child is a subject star
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.400]   or a memory master this year,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.440]   be consistent, creative,
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.400]   and celebrate all of the good things
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.520]   that you and your family are doing together.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.480]   And I hope your 2025 is the best year yet in foundations.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.600]   - Thank you, Kelly.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.480]   Okay, guys, see you next week.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.320]   Bye-bye.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.300]   you
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
