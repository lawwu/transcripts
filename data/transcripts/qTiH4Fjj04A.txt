[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   1 Corinthians 1 26 commands us, "Consider your calling."
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.280]   So what is our calling?
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.400]   Pastor John explained in his sermon by that very title preached back on April 25th, 2010.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000]   Here's a clip of what he said in that sermon.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.840]   Verse 26, "Consider your calling, brothers."
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920]   That's what I'm asking you to do right now.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.800]   Do some considering right now.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.920]   And the first thing I suppose you'd ask is, "What's he talking about?
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   My job?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920]   A carpenter?
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   Nurse?
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920]   Teacher?
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   Homemaker?"
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.800]   No, that's not what he's talking about.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.080]   How do you know that's not what he's talking about?
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.200]   Well, mainly I know because of verses 22 to 24.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   Read this.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.880]   "Consider, consider your calling, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.600]   Consider your calling as I read," verses 22 to 24.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320]   "Jews demand signs.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.680]   Greeks seek wisdom.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews, and folly to Gentiles," or
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.800]   Greeks, same, he's using them interchangeably, "but to those who are called, both Jews and
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.480]   Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.400]   So when the called look at Christ crucified, they don't see stumbling block.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.720]   They don't see folly.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.480]   They see power.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.480]   So there are three groups, right?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.880]   Three groups in those verses.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.100]   Number one, Jews.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.160]   Number two, Gentiles.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800]   Number three, called.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.080]   That's not quite accurate, is it?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.280]   Let me say it a little more carefully.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.360]   There are Jews who are not called, Gentiles who are not called, and Jews and Gentiles
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.360]   who are called.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   Those are the three groups.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.040]   Are you with me?
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.960]   This is -- we're considering our calling.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200]   We're obeying verse 26.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.560]   There are Jews not called, Gentiles not called, Jews and Gentiles, some of whom are called.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.720]   And then he describes the response of each to the cross.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.440]   Jews, yeah, stumbling block, crucified Messiah, never heard of such a thing.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.560]   Gentiles, foolishness, a dying God, silly, mythological.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.520]   Called power, my God.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   What kind of call is that?
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.500]   I'll tell you what kind of call it is.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's the kind of call that creates what it commands.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.480]   The call gives light.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.440]   The call creates sight.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.040]   The call raises the dead.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.120]   Lazarus, come forth.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000]   He didn't decide to.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The call raised him from the dead.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.520]   Let me give you an analogy that could be misleading.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.600]   It helps me.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.080]   Just to get your handle on it because lots of you have never been taught about the call
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   of God.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.760]   The mighty, effectual, irresistible, powerful, saving, awakening, life-giving call of God
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.120]   that saved you.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.200]   You've never been taught about this.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   So you need a little analogy to help you.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.280]   What is he talking about?
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.040]   I've never heard anything like this.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.240]   I thought I just believed in Jesus.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.620]   And suppose somebody is asleep and you want to wake them up.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.620]   What do you do?
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620]   Well, you bend over.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.620]   They're sound asleep.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.280]   You bend over them and you say, "Wake up!"
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.400]   And they bolt right upright.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.440]   Now what are the dynamics of that moment?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.560]   They were sound asleep and bang, they were awake.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.640]   Did they hear the call and say, "I'll think about that before I wake up.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.240]   And then I'll decide if I want to wake up."
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.240]   When God issues a call to your dead heart and says, "Wake up!"
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   You wake up.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.040]   You did not make yourself a Christian.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.180]   Just face it.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.900]   You didn't make yourself a Christian, which is why you should feel so incredibly loved.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.680]   In fact, if you need a text to say that, just go to Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 where Paul
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.240]   says just as clearly as can be, "Because of his great love."
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's the only place he uses that phrase in all the New Testament.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.280]   "Because of his great love, he made you alive when you were dead."
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.960]   So if you have any spiritual life in you at all, you have been greatly loved.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.480]   Beautiful.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.320]   And a special thank you to Ask Pastor John podcast listener, Luis Sanchez from Hialeah,
