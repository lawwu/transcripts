[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   I think maybe the key to life and being successful is playing the right games.
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.960]   And if you only have like so many words you can say a day, so many hours in the day, where
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.800]   is it worth the negotiating or dealmaking and where isn't it?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.680]   And most people spend their time on really low level activities, coupon cutting, asking
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.840]   for a discount at a restaurant or whatever.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.920]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.600]   But instead of doing that, you can just be a little bit more strategic upfront and think
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.280]   about if I negotiated my salary every single year, for sure, but maybe even twice a year,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.260]   mid-year review time, I can never clip a coupon again and make more from just negotiating
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.260]   my salary.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.720]   And then a second level from that is if I could figure out how to negotiate, how to
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.560]   buy assets that cashflow and can do 100X or 300X return to me, then I don't even have
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.640]   to negotiate my salary that much because I just take the salary, use the salary, apply
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.400]   it to assets that I keep buying, those keep cashflowing for me.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   So it's all about what level are you playing?
