[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   Welcome back on this Thursday.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.400]   Well, if you were to sit down
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.160]   with John Piper's collected works,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.320]   his 13 volume collected works,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.200]   published back in 2017,
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   and if you read the entire thing beginning to end,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.160]   you'd come across the word satisfy or satisfied
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.600]   nearly 1500 times.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.720]   Satisfy, satisfied, those loaded terms
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.360]   are all over those works,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.400]   and they're all over your ministry, Pastor John,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.200]   but we rarely, if ever, read a definition
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400]   of what you mean by the term
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.040]   leading to Ralph's question today.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.020]   Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.760]   I thank God for your ministry in my life.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.240]   I have read many of your books
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.200]   and listened to many of your messages,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.440]   especially those on Christian hedonism.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.440]   That idea revolutionized my relationship with the Lord.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120]   You have spoken about being satisfied in God
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.000]   thousands and thousands of times in your life,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.880]   but I cannot find any reference in your works
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.280]   to where you have defined that term.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   To you, what does it mean to be satisfied?
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.000]   This is good for me to be pressed
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.720]   to ponder a term that I ordinarily use
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.920]   because I consider it self-explanatory.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.300]   Sometimes those are the very terms
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.120]   that would be most fruitful to at least try
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.000]   to put into words or to relate to real life experiences
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.880]   so that we don't just speak with empty phrases.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520]   So thank you for the question.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.500]   I think the first thing to say is
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.160]   that it doesn't really matter very much
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.480]   what John Piper means by satisfaction,
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.600]   but it matters a lot.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.880]   I mean, it's hard to exaggerate how much it matters
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.580]   what God means by it.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   When his inspired spokesman in the Bible used the word,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.760]   for example, Psalm 90,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.980]   satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.380]   that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.280]   Psalm 63, my soul will be satisfied in the Lord
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.320]   as with fat and rich food.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.720]   Psalm 65, we shall be satisfied
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.160]   with the goodness of your house,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.260]   the holiness of your temple.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280]   Psalm 103, the Lord satisfies you with good
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   so that your youth is renewed like the eagles.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.240]   Psalm 107, he satisfies the longing soul.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.560]   Matthew 5, verse six,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.460]   blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.560]   for they shall be satisfied.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.020]   Philippians 4, I have learned in whatever situation I am
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.800]   to be satisfied or content.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   I know how to abound and I know how to be in need satisfied.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.040]   Hebrews 13, keep your life free from the love of money
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   and be satisfied, be content with what you have
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.960]   for the Lord has promised never to leave you.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   So it's not so much what I think satisfaction is matters,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   but rather what do texts like these mean?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.640]   What did God intend when he called us
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   in all those passages and others to be satisfied?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   What kind of experience are we talking about?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.080]   So let me try to get at what satisfaction in God
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   or satisfaction in all that God is for us refers to.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.940]   First, notice that the experience of satisfaction
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.140]   corresponds to desire and longing
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.120]   and yearning in the human heart.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.820]   There would be no such thing as satisfaction
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.360]   if there were no such thing as desire.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.300]   God created human beings as desire factories.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   Everybody has desires, longings, yearnings, wantings.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.020]   God made us that way.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.080]   And our problem as sinners is not that our desires
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.660]   are too strong, but that they are directed
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.360]   toward the wrong things.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.460]   That's the essence of sin.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.820]   That's the essence of evil.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.820]   Jeremiah 2, 13, my people have committed two great evils.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.860]   What is that?
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.540]   They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.660]   Number two, they have hewed out for themselves cisterns,
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.820]   broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.020]   That's evil.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.060]   Evil is to turn away from being satisfied
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.660]   with God as your fountain.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.700]   All our desires are designed by God to be Godward desires,
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.100]   to move toward the fountain of living water.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.900]   Even when we desire earthly things like food or friendship
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.900]   or praise or beauty, all these things are tastes
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.260]   of God's goodness and pointers to God
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.980]   as the final satisfaction.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.820]   - Yes.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.080]   - So the first thing I would say about the meaning
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.540]   of satisfaction in God is that it refers to the experience
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.540]   of having our desire, longing, yearning, wanting filled.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:53.180]   And filled means not too little and not too much.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.900]   Satisfaction in God is the experience where God is enjoyed
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.940]   as the perfect fullness that corresponds
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.940]   to the God-shaped desires of our hearts.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.460]   Number two, sometimes I use the phrase all satisfying,
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.100]   like the all satisfying God.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.100]   And by this, I mean that there are no desires
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.300]   which in the end, God will not purify
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   and satisfy with himself.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.900]   Even sinful desires have some vestige of legitimacy.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.020]   And God will rescue that fragment of legitimacy
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.100]   and cleanse it of all that is destructive
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.060]   and fill it up in the age to come.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.060]   When this sinful age is over and the kingdom has fully
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.580]   and manifestly come, there will be no unmet longings,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.020]   no unfulfilled desires, no dis-satisfaction.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.860]   Number three, there are many mysteries
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.700]   about what our experience will be like
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.180]   when we are totally perfected in the age to come.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.180]   But for now, I want to stress that to say Jesus
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.700]   is all satisfying does not mean that when he becomes
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.300]   our satisfaction, our desiring ceases.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.820]   That would be a mistake to say that our desiring ceases.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   Jesus says in John 6.35, "I am the bread of life.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.660]   "Whoever comes to me shall not hunger
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.300]   "and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.380]   Now, I don't think he means that when we are born again
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.900]   and receive him by faith, we never desire him again.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   - Right.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.460]   - I don't think he means that.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.340]   I think he means finding Jesus to be the bread
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.340]   and the water that our souls have always longed for
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.620]   means our quest is over.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.620]   We no longer look for a better drink or a better food.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:38.060]   We have found our all satisfying treasure.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:44.180]   But in this sinful age, and I'm including myself now
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.420]   as a sinner, remaining corruption within me
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.940]   that needs mortifying in this sinful age
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.740]   where the heart of faith is always embattled
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.980]   and the heart of faith is always embattled.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.620]   Our experience of the satisfaction of Christ
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.540]   will always be imperfect, fragmentary, ever-changing,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.660]   renewable, greater and lesser.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.300]   Christ remains who he is, right?
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.420]   He doesn't change.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.140]   He remains who he is, all satisfying.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.860]   And our new birth with new spiritual taste buds
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.300]   who know he is the all satisfying one
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.940]   remains attached to him.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.780]   We don't lose him and then find him
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.100]   and lose him and then find him.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.780]   He holds onto us.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.780]   We do not run away after some new fountain or new bread.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.700]   But for now, our experience is up and down.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.820]   It won't be like that in the age to come.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.900]   How desire and satisfaction will be related
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.540]   in the age to come, frankly, I can't answer that fully.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:09.180]   Number four, and finally, and this is really important.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.340]   The reality of love for other people
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.460]   and especially compassion for those who suffer
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.460]   demands that our satisfaction in this age of pain
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.660]   and sorrow be a dissatisfied satisfaction.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.980]   Almost 40 years ago, when I wrote the chapter on love
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.220]   in the book "Desiring God," I said this,
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   "The weeping of compassion is the weeping of joy,"
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.020]   or you could say, "The weeping of satisfaction,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.020]   impeded, hindered in the extension of itself to another."
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.700]   Close quote.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.300]   Now that sounds paradoxical.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.140]   - Yeah.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.660]   - Weeping satisfaction, an odd phrase.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660]   But what it means is that when God grants me to know him
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.060]   as satisfying to my soul's deepest needs,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.260]   and then I look on a suffering person,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.700]   my God-given satisfaction at that moment
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.980]   has in it the impulse to expand
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.340]   and include the other person in it.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.620]   I want them in it.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.940]   I want them to share it.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.900]   Satisfaction in God is not indifferent
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.540]   to those who don't share it.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.460]   If we could, we would fold them in
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.380]   and into our satisfaction in God.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.820]   But if we are hindered from that,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.340]   it is our very joy, our very satisfaction,
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.900]   impeded in the extension of itself that grieves.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.740]   It is a peculiarly Christian form
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.620]   of dissatisfied satisfaction.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.860]   So Ralph, that's my effort to clarify
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.580]   what I mean by satisfaction in God.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.580]   One, it is a filling up of God-given, God-shaped desires.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.580]   Two, it will in the end leave no desire unfilled
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.660]   for God's children forever.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.540]   Three, for now the satisfaction in God
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.540]   is embattled and variable, and desires must be rekindled.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.380]   Four, for now even the best experience of satisfaction
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.420]   in God is a dissatisfied satisfaction
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.300]   when we are surrounded by the pain of those
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.300]   who don't yet have it and the sorrows of this fallen world.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.660]   - Wonderful summary and definition here, Pastor John.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.820]   Thank you for walking us through all those Bible texts.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.540]   And Ralph, thank you for the excellent
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.460]   foundational question today.
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.500]   No one has asked this question to this point
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.260]   in the podcast that I can remember.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.820]   If you have a great question like Ralph did
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.620]   that you wanna ask Pastor John,
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.220]   maybe one that no one else is asking, email me,
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.100]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.660]   Next week we're gonna launch into a mini-series of sorts,
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.820]   apologetics questions on the person and work of Christ.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.380]   Questions like, why did Christ leave after Easter?
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.660]   Couldn't he have just stayed with us?
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.100]   Or why didn't his redemption of us
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.300]   cost him eternal suffering?
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.460]   Isn't that the price?
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.420]   And why isn't there more archeological
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.660]   or historical written evidence
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.660]   for the death and resurrection of Christ?
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.940]   Those types of questions, big questions,
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.860]   up next and over the next couple of weeks.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.780]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.180]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:12.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
