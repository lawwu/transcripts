[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.080]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, in the fourth chapter and the eighteenth verse.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.000]   The eighteenth verse in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.640]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.840]   the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.960]   recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.200]   acceptable yard of the Lord.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.880]   I want in particular this evening to consider one phrase only in that great statement, namely
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:05.000]   the phrase in which our Lord says that God had sent him to heal the brokenhearted.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.920]   Now those of you who are looking at the revised version will find that you haven't got that
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.120]   phrase.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.800]   It seems to me a great pity that the revisers, following certain texts rather than others,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   should have omitted a phrase which is to be found in the Hebrew of the sixty-first chapter
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   of the book of the prophet Isaiah, out of which this whole quotation comes, and also
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.160]   in the translation of the Septuagint.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   But there it is.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.720]   It's not in the revised and others, but it's here in the authorised version.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.800]   the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.760]   Now we come back once more to this statement.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.200]   We began considering it last Sunday evening, and we thus are spending time with it because
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.680]   it is obviously a very crucial statement.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.560]   It is a statement that was made by our Lord at the very commencement of his public ministry.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.200]   The context, you remember, is this.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   Our Lord had set out to preach at the age of thirty.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.200]   He had gone to John the Baptist and had asked him to baptise him, and he was baptised.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.640]   And as he was there coming up out of the water, the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   of a dove.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.960]   And a voice came from heaven saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   And then we are told that our Lord was driven, led of the Spirit, into the wilderness to
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.120]   be tempted of Satan forty days and forty nights.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   And we remember how he repulsed him and repelled him and vanquished him.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.760]   And then we are told after that he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.240]   And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.520]   And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it is written, "The Spirit
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.560]   of the Lord is upon me," and so on.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   It was, in other words, the sixty-first chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.080]   And our Lord, having read that first verse out of the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah's
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.640]   prophecy, handed the book back and sat down and began to speak.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:53.360]   And this is what he said, "This day, this scripture is fulfilled in your ears."
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.560]   In other words, he there says and claims that what Isaiah had prophesied about eight hundred
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.120]   years before was a prophecy concerning him, that he is the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.480]   He is the one upon whom the Spirit of the Lord has come.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.760]   It came at the baptism.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:24.480]   There he was anointed and the voice came saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   pleased."
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.000]   So here, in his own hometown, as it were, he goes into the synagogue on the Sunday and
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.320]   he lets them know exactly what his message is.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.600]   He says, "That's my message.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.720]   That's why I've come.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.480]   That is what I have to say."
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.800]   Now we learn elsewhere in the Gospels that the voice of God also spoke concerning him
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.640]   on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.120]   There were Peter and James and John with him and they saw him transfigured and transformed.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.280]   His very clothing began to shine with a brightness that no fuller on earth can ever produce.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.320]   And suddenly there came the voice again saying, "This is my beloved Son.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.600]   Hear him."
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.080]   That's what God commands the world tonight, is to listen to his Son.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.880]   Well therefore I say the most important thing for us is to know what the Son says.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.000]   God has assured us that the answer to all our problems and to all our questions is to
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.560]   be found in this Son of his, this well beloved Son in whom he is well pleased.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.960]   And we are to listen to him.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   Well what does he say?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.520]   Well here he answers the question.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.800]   This is his message.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.400]   He says here that this is why he has come into the world, that God has sent him to do
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.920]   this very thing.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.640]   And what a wonderful statement it is.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.800]   "He hath anointed me," he says, "and sent me to preach the gospel, glad tidings to the
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.120]   poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to give deliverance to captives, to give sight to
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.600]   the blind," and so on.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.400]   What wonderful words, what gracious words.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.640]   That's what he said a way back nearly two thousand years ago in that synagogue in Nazareth.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.720]   But my dear friends, that's what he's saying still.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   That's what he's saying tonight.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.480]   That's his proclamation to the world as it is at this hour.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.480]   This is his message.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.040]   We are told in that same record that some of those people were rather amazed when they
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.360]   heard these gracious words coming over his lips.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.800]   But you remember that as he went on to speak they became infuriated.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.720]   And we are told that they so hated him that they tried to throw him down to destruction
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.040]   from the brow of the hill just outside the town.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.400]   But he walked miraculously through them all and escaped.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.200]   But how do you explain this?
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:27.320]   How is it possible that anybody should feel hatred to one who speaks such gracious words?
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.360]   Surely you would have thought that everybody would have grasped them, everyone would have
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.520]   taken the words and the speaker to their bosoms and would have thanked God for him and would
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   have gone after him.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.840]   But they didn't.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.880]   His fate was to be rejected of men.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.080]   His fate was to be despised.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.160]   His fate was to be crucified.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   They preferred a robber to him.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.600]   They said away with him, crucify him.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.560]   Now that's the great problem that confronts us as we read our four Gospels, that anybody
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:13.680]   could reject such gracious words, such a wonderful offer.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.380]   But it's still the same.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.720]   And that's the tragedy of the world this evening.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.000]   We're all talking about the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb as if that's the tragedy and
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   the problem.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.280]   My dear friends, the real problem is this.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.780]   Why is it that the whole world isn't listening to this Son of God and following him and living
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.660]   life as he would have us live it?
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.520]   If they did, there'd be no problem about the atomic bomb or any other bomb.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   This is the primary question.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.800]   And that is why I call your attention to it.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.440]   Why is it, I say, that men are not thrilled by these words?
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.640]   There's only one answer.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   It's because they don't realize their need of him.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.920]   It's because they don't realize the truth about themselves.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.140]   It's because they don't realize their condition.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:18.080]   To put it in a word, it's because they don't understand what is meant by the word sin.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.820]   Now this is a very simple principle, isn't it?
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.440]   If you are in desperate need of something and suddenly somebody comes along and offers
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.120]   you that very thing, oh how glad you are how you rejoice and you show it.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.440]   You say, "I don't know what to say to you.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   I don't know how to thank you."
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.740]   You're beaming with smiles.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.520]   You clap your hands perhaps and you go and tell everybody.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.960]   Our Lord has pictured all that, hasn't he?
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.320]   He's told us about the joy of the shepherd who lost a sheep, about the woman who lost
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:55.000]   a coin, about the father who lost a son, and how in each case when they find them, oh how
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.520]   they rejoice.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.840]   If you are desperately ill and in pain, you're delighted to see the doctor coming through
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.240]   the door, aren't you?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.040]   You know he's got something in the bag that can relieve you.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   There's no need to argue with you about it.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.520]   There's no need to convince you that you're in pain and that you need help.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.720]   You know it and therefore when you see him, thank God you say.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:33.360]   But here is the Son of God come down from heaven to earth, even dying a shameful death
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:42.480]   upon a cross and telling us that he's doing so for us.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   We all pass by and say irrelevant, sob stuff.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.080]   All right for women and children, but not meeting the facts of life.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.940]   He's ignored.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.320]   No one pays attention.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.320]   Why?
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.560]   Well I've already given you the answer.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.200]   They don't realize their need of him.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.760]   They're not aware of their condition apart from him.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:14.160]   In other words I say, they've never understood what is meant by the word sin.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.480]   Because you notice that our Lord in his statement in his dealing with this quotation from the
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:26.800]   61st chapter of Isaiah, what he really says there is this, that he has come into the world
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.200]   in order to deal with the problem of sin.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.680]   He makes use of these ancient words of Isaiah because there Isaiah has collected together
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.560]   a number of very wonderful pictures which depict sin.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   That's what they are.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.760]   These are pictures.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.860]   He's not talking literally about the poor.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.520]   We saw last Sunday night he means the poor in spirit.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.880]   He isn't talking about a literal broken heart.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.000]   If a heart is literally broken it's death and nothing can be done.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.960]   No, no, these are all pictures.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   Likewise with the captives and the blind and all the others.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.000]   Marvelous portrayals, depictions of the effects of sin upon men.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.480]   And our Lord therefore in other words is saying quite plainly that he is here in the world,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   he has come from heaven, he sets out in his ministry in order to deal with this whole
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.760]   problem of sin.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.040]   And it's a very simple sermon this which he preached there.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.520]   And it's really very plain.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.080]   Let's put it like this.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.560]   Sin is one condition, it's a disease.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.640]   But it shows itself in many different ways.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.040]   It has many symptoms.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   I think that's the simplest way of putting it.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.200]   One disease may have many symptoms.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.600]   There are many diseases for instance that give you a headache and a dry tongue.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.520]   Those are but symptoms of one disease.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   There may be one disease, think of a disease like pneumonia, there's terrible trouble
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   in your lung.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.720]   Yes, but in addition there is the headache, there is the fever, there is the thirst and
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.160]   all the rest of it.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.880]   Many symptoms, one disease.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.560]   Now sin is exactly like that.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.360]   There is but one sin in mankind and that, there is but one disease in mankind and that
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   is sin.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.840]   But it's almost protean in its manifestations.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.240]   And here we are given some of them in this wonderful picture.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:47.520]   So you notice that they all rarely describe the same essential condition, but in different
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.440]   ways we are looking at different aspects.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   And yet there are certain things that are common to them all.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:04.360]   And the first thing that is common to them all is this, that it is only those who realize
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.680]   what they are suffering from who derive the benefit.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.440]   The Lord Jesus Christ, as we saw last Sunday night, says that he has come to preach the
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:21.280]   gospel to the poor, and the gospel of Christ is only gospel, it's only good news to those
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.920]   who realize how poor they are.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   The Pharisees didn't regard it as good news at all.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.880]   The self-righteous today see nothing in it.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   Why?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.480]   Well, they've never realized their own poverty.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   So I put again the question I put last Sunday night.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   Do you regard this gospel as the greatest good news you've ever heard?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   If you don't, you're not only not a Christian, you're telling me that you've never seen
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.520]   your poverty in a spiritual sense.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.880]   And it's exactly the same with this second picture which we are going to look at this
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   evening.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.800]   Here is another manifestation of sin.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.240]   And our Lord says with respect to it that he's come to heal it.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.760]   But you see, the only people who are going to be healed by Christ are those who realize
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.560]   that they've got broken hearts, and those who are sick, and those who are ill.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.400]   He said himself, didn't he, "They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   that are sick."
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.720]   I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.320]   The only people who can say tonight, "Christ has healed me," are those who've known that
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   they've been sick.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.440]   Very well then, let's look at this picture together.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:46.360]   Last Sunday night we were looking at sin as it leads to poverty, to penury.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.800]   Sin is something which makes us beggars.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.880]   Tonight we are looking at it in a different form, and here it is.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.400]   It's something that leads to a broken heart.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:05.680]   "I am come, I am sent to heal the brokenhearted."
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.920]   What's he mean?
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.640]   What is his teaching at this point?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.720]   Well, I want to suggest to you that the best answer to that question, or if you like, the
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:20.920]   best commentary on this phrase, is just to go back to the 61st chapter of Isaiah and
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.480]   read the context there.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:33.160]   For there, I think I can show you, is a perfect exposition of what is meant by being brokenhearted.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.560]   So I divide my matter in this form.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:43.960]   Sin is something that leads to a brokenhearted condition.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   What does that mean?
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.760]   Well, let me analyze it as best I can.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.280]   It includes these things.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.560]   It means, first of all, failure.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.360]   Sin always leads to failure.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.640]   Sin is that which causes everything finally to go to pieces.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.240]   Now that's put very clearly in a pictorial form in the third and fourth verses of Isaiah's
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   chapter.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.120]   He says, "To appoint unto them that morn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.440]   the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.160]   might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:37.800]   And then, and they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:45.200]   and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations."
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.400]   That's a wonderful description of it.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.480]   Failure.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   What sort of failure?
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.680]   Well, it's this sort of failure according to the picture.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:02.840]   You're walking along a road and suddenly you see a tree that has been blown down.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:10.000]   Not a great majestic oak standing, erect as ever, but a slender sort of tree, blown down
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.920]   by the wind, by the gale, the hurricane.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.840]   It didn't seem to have any strength in it.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:24.600]   It didn't seem to stand upright in righteousness, bent and blown down and torn.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   Or another way you can look at it is this.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.720]   It leads to a kind of wilderness, to a kind of waste.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:40.560]   They shall build the old wastes, a sort of barren and productive soil, a kind of wilderness
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.600]   instead of being a fruitful land.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.440]   And then another picture he uses is that it's a picture of waste, desolate cities, towns
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.560]   in ruins, everything broken down.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:04.760]   Now that, according to the Bible, is something which sin always tends to do.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.920]   Sin leads to failure.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.780]   Things are not as they ought to be.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.040]   Instead of that upright tree, bent and broken.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.560]   Instead of fruitful fields, no crops at all, desolate, barren.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:31.920]   Instead of a city built up and inhabited and rejoicing, waste, rubble, ruins, houses broken
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.880]   down, streets in disorder, everything's gone wrong.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.040]   That according to the Bible, from beginning to end, is what sin always does.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.680]   It makes havoc of life.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.520]   It turns life into a failure.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:55.560]   That's the first thing about this brokenhearted condition.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.720]   Are you a failure, my friend?
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.380]   Are you very pleased with yourself tonight as you review your life?
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.360]   Is everything going well?
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.960]   Are you what you were meant to be?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.480]   Have you succeeded in doing what you set out to do?
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.280]   How are you getting on in your moral life?
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   What's the condition of your chastity and your purity?
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.400]   What's your mind like?
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.480]   What's your imagination like?
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480]   Is all well?
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.680]   Are you successful?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.200]   Is everything flourishing?
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   Are you proud of it?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   Are you pleased with it?
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.720]   Are you rejoicing in it all?
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   Have you stood up to life?
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.080]   Are you a success or are you a failure?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.520]   That's the question the Bible asks.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   Sin always leads to failure.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.320]   Man was made in the image of God.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.720]   He was meant to be Lord of creation.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.320]   He was meant to reflect something of perfection of the Eternal himself.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   What is he?
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.600]   Well, look at the world.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.320]   And you see nothing but desolation.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.560]   You see nothing but waste.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.000]   You see nothing but ruin.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Failure.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's true of all.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.540]   It's true of the individual.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.280]   But it doesn't stop at that, you see.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.080]   There's something further and that is the sense of shame that accompanies this because
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.680]   the broken-hearted are conscious of their failure and they bemoan their failure and
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.400]   they hate themselves for their failure and they can't forgive themselves for their
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400]   failure.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.240]   A sense of shame.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:53.320]   Men put it once in a hymn by putting it like this, "The ruins of my soul repair and dwell
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.120]   without a rival there."
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.680]   Do you know what it is to have a sense of shame?
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.840]   Do you know what it is to feel that you can scarcely forgive yourself?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.680]   Having resolved never to fall to that thing again, you've fallen again.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:20.120]   And you hate yourself and you're amazed at yourself and you despise yourself.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   You say, "How could I have done it again?
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.960]   What brought me?"
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   A sense of shame.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.560]   It's always a part of this broken-hearted condition.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.160]   Is there no sense of shame in you, my friend?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.680]   Is all well with your soul, I ask?
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.520]   Are you perfectly content with yourself?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:42.120]   Are you congratulating yourself?
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.320]   Or are there things in your life at this moment of which you're so ashamed that you've
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.520]   never mentioned them to anybody and you wouldn't dare do so?
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.120]   You'd be ashamed to tell them.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.040]   The broken-hearted are aware of this shame and in turn it's accompanied by a sense
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   of despair.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.080]   There's all the difference in the world, isn't there, between just feeling sorry
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.280]   and being broken-hearted.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.000]   The man who's merely sorry who feels a little pang of remorse says, "Ah, I'll put that
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   right.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   I'll never do that again.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I'll be all right next time.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I was a fool there.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I shouldn't have done it.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Never again."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's remorse.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   It doesn't last long.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   He goes back and does it again.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   But here is someone broken-hearted.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Why?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.320]   Well, for this reason.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.600]   They've so often determined to put things right.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.560]   They've so often pledged and vowed that they'll never do it again.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   They are determined to live a holy and a godly and a religious life.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.240]   But try as they will, they fail again and go down.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.040]   And there's a sense of despair.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.600]   Broken-hearted, not passing remorse, but a realization that the situation seems hopeless,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.360]   that nothing can be done.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.840]   And of course, this all finally leads to the condition described here as one of mourning.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.640]   It leads to intense misery and wretchedness and mourning.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   What is the position?
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   Well, here's the picture.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.200]   It's somebody sitting on the ground in the dust, and he's put ashes on his head, and
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   he's put sackcloth on his body.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:26.320]   Ashes, and a kind of garment which suits the spirit of heaviness.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.720]   Did you notice the terms?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.320]   To appoint unto them that morn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:41.720]   joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.680]   That's the picture of a broken-hearted person.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.960]   Sackcloth and ashes.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:55.560]   No brightness, no joy on the face, no joy in the life, in the gate, in the walk, in
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.920]   the whole approach to others, but self-condemnation.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:07.600]   Unhappy, failing to sleep at night, going over and over it, can't get rid of it.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.280]   Mourning, ashes, sackcloth, the spirit of heaviness.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.440]   Life has become a burden.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.920]   The man's become a burden to himself, he doesn't know what to do with himself.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   He can't rouse himself.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:28.760]   He realizes he's mastered by sin, and he's wretched, and he's unhappy.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.720]   Everything seems to have gone wrong.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.320]   Life has become a failure.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   He says, "Can't I do anything right?"
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.840]   He looks at his whole life and existence.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.440]   He remembers how he began.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.760]   He looks at what he is.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.720]   He sees nothing but failure and shame, and therefore he's wretched and miserable and
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.880]   unhappy about it all.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   It's to people like that that Jesus Christ comes.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.120]   And you know, my friends, it's only, as I said just now, to people like that, that he
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.800]   does come.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.600]   You read your Bible, and you'll find everywhere that it's people who've had that sort of
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   experience, who know him and who rejoice in his salvation.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:16.520]   Take a man like King David, for instance, the sweet psalmist, the sweet singer of Israel.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.560]   This is how he puts it.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:26.440]   "Create within me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:32.640]   "He's in the depths, out of the depths cry I unto thee."
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.160]   And then you remember how he puts it again in that self-same 51st Psalm, "The sacrifices
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:50.880]   of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise."
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.480]   It's people who know something like that, are the ones who know the healing of the Lord.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.280]   Listen to Isaiah, indeed, putting it very well in a great verse in the 57th chapter
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.920]   of this prophecy of his.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.280]   This is how he puts it.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.040]   The Lord is speaking through him.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:12.560]   "Thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in the
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:20.640]   high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.680]   the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.080]   This is the paradox of God and of redeeming grace.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.480]   He dwells, the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.280]   Who are the people who know him and who dwell with him?
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:47.000]   The humble, contrite, broken hearts and nobody else.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.040]   Not your Pharisee, not your self-righteous person, not the self-satisfied one, the broken
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.440]   hearted.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.800]   But listen to it in the New Testament.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:07.160]   The world probably has never known a man who has known so much what it was to rejoice and
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.920]   to be truly happy as the apostle Paul.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.640]   No man per chance ever knew Christ as well as he did.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:24.400]   He could even say to me, "To live is Christ and to die is gain that I might be with Christ,"
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.080]   which is far better.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.120]   He knew him, he loved him, he rejoiced in him.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.040]   What brought him there?
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.360]   He tells us himself.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.960]   It is the same man who said on one occasion, "Oh, wretched man that I am!
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.400]   Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.360]   He was broken hearted.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   Why?
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.040]   Well, because he realized his sinfulness.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.680]   He realized this foul, devilish, hellish thing that was within him.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   To will is present with me, but how to perform, I know not.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.840]   I love the law of God with my mind, but I find another law in my members, opposed to
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.520]   the law of God, dragging me down, making me a slave.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:23.960]   The evil that I would not, that I do, and the good that I would, I do not.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:30.560]   Oh, wretched man that I am!
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.040]   That is the sort of man who knows Jesus Christ.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:42.640]   That is the sort of man who knows what it is to be healed by Christ, to heal the broken
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   hearted.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   So I ask you the obvious question at this point.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.480]   Are you rejoicing in Jesus Christ?
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.680]   Do you love him?
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.560]   Are you thrilled by the very thought of his name?
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:09.400]   Can you say honestly in your heart this evening, "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds to this
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.160]   believer here!"
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.460]   Can you say that?
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.280]   If you can't, my friend, there is only one reason for it.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.920]   You have never been broken hearted.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.880]   Your heart has never been broken about yourself.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.360]   You have never faced yourself.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   You have never seen yourself.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.600]   No, no, don't think you can get away with it by saying, "Ah, but I have always lived
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.280]   a good and a decent and a moral and a religious life."
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.080]   If that is your argument, I just send you straight again to Saul of Tarsus.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.400]   He leaves you hopelessly in the shade, and yet he was broken hearted about himself, as
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:51.040]   was Charles Wesley, a most exemplary, moral, good, religious young man who spent his life
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   doing good.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.880]   This is what he says, "Just and holy is thy name.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.960]   I am all unrighteousness.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:07.000]   Vile and full of sin I am."
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.040]   That is the sort of man who can say, "Thou, O Christ, art all I want.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.120]   More than all in thee I find, Jesus, lover of my soul."
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.200]   Has your heart been broken?
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.720]   If it hasn't, I say it is simply because you have never examined yourself.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   You have never faced yourself.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.760]   You have never read your Scriptures truly.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.040]   You have never pictured yourself standing before God in holiness and eternal justice.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.080]   You have never looked at the vile, foul things that are in you as they are in all of us by
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.560]   nature.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.320]   That is why you have never known what it is to be healed.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.600]   That is the condition.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:56.200]   But oh, if you are broken hearted, if you have come to this service because you know
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.240]   that you are a failure, and because you are miserable and wretched and unhappy, and cannot
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:07.800]   forgive yourself, and are sitting metaphorically in dust and ashes with sackcloth upon your
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:13.840]   skin, I have a wonderful message for you.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.080]   He says, "I am come to heal the broken hearted."
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   How does he do it?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.840]   Well, let me put it like this to you.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.640]   Let me tell you what he doesn't do and how important this is.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   How does he heal?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.400]   Well, he heals in this way.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.840]   He doesn't condemn.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   He doesn't merely condemn.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.480]   There is a very wonderful statement about him again by Isaiah, quoted by our Lord in
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.600]   another place.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:50.240]   He says, "He shall not cry aloud, the bruised reed he shall not break, and the smoking flax
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.960]   he shall not quench."
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.640]   What a wonderful picture of him.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.240]   He hasn't come to condemn and to destroy.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.560]   He hasn't come in a sense to judge.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.880]   His coming does judge, but he hasn't come in order to judge and to condemn.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:15.400]   No, no, this is the amazing paradox, I say again, that he, though he was what he was,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.640]   is the one of all others who doesn't condemn.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.680]   Let me give you the illustrations.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.880]   Do you remember on one occasion he went at the invitation of a Pharisee into his house
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.360]   to have a meal?
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.640]   And the moment he sat down and reclined, a poor woman came, who was a notorious sinner
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.120]   in the town, and she simply fell at his feet and washed his feet with her tears, and then
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.440]   began to wipe them with the hair of her head.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:48.720]   And we are told the Pharisee, watching all this, said, "If this man were the prophet
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:55.000]   that he claims to be, he would know exactly the character of this woman who was there
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.800]   washing his feet with her tears, and he'd send her out through the door."
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.440]   He obviously doesn't know it.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.000]   Oh, poor Pharisee, he doesn't understand.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.040]   He has come to seek and to save a woman like that.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.320]   He's interested.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.160]   He doesn't condemn.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.120]   But there's a still more specific instance, you remember, in the eighth chapter of John's
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.360]   Gospel.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.960]   The Pharisees and the experts in religious matter brought him a woman one day, and they
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.000]   said, "Now then, come along, we want your judgment.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.880]   We have caught this woman in the very act of adultery.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.680]   Now then, what do you say about her?"
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.440]   And you remember how he dealt with the situation.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   He began writing something on the sand, and he said to the men who had brought her along,
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.800]   "He that is without sin amongst you, let him first cast a stone."
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.400]   And they all simply slunk out of sight.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.440]   And our Lord lifted up his head and looked at the woman and said, "Woman, where are
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.560]   these thine accusers?"
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:09.200]   And then he looked at her and said, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.520]   Go and sin no more."
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.240]   He didn't condemn her.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.720]   He hadn't come to condemn.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.440]   Sin produces the condemnation against the law of God.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.000]   There is the condemnation.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.320]   He hasn't come to condemn.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.600]   This is very important, this negative.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.800]   There was nothing about him that so astounded and amazed and annoyed the Pharisees and the
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:40.040]   doctors of the law as the fact that he was one who sat down amongst publicans and sinners.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.640]   He sat amongst publicans and sinners, and he ate and he drank with them.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.440]   And they said, "This man is a gluttonous man and a wine-bebber, a friend of publicans
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   and sinners."
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   They wouldn't look at them.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.840]   They wouldn't sit near them.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.760]   But they hated them and abhorred them.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.160]   He comes to them, mixes with them.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   Why?
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.000]   He hasn't come to condemn.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.080]   The business of the physician is not only to diagnose.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.800]   He has come to heal.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.840]   But secondly, he has not simply come to exhort them to live a better life or to hold up an
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.440]   example and a standard and to teach them to imitate him.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   No, no.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.160]   Thank God it isn't this.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:31.000]   I know nothing that makes me feel so utterly hopeless as the idea that I've got to imitate
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Jesus Christ.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.560]   I can't satisfy myself.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   I can't satisfy you.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.920]   Who am I to imitate Jesus Christ?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.920]   Who are you?
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.160]   Thank God, I say, he hasn't come merely to give an example and to say, "Look at me.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   Live like this.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   This is how you ought to be.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   Here is my command.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   Carry it out."
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.160]   "Impossible," I say.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   Thank God he hasn't come to do that.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.680]   No, no.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.880]   He has come to heal.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.800]   He has come to do something positive.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.040]   He has come to bind up the brokenhearted.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.000]   He has come to heal the sickness, the disease.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   How does he do it?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.760]   Well, he does it like this.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.280]   He does it by just being what he is.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.600]   The medical illustration is obvious, isn't it?
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.320]   There are some doctors whose personalities do you more good than their medicines, and
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   rightly so.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.760]   You say, "You know, the moment he came in through the door, I began to feel better."
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Quite right.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.680]   It's literally true.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.080]   It's an essential part of the work of the physician.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   And the Lord Jesus Christ heals partly by being what he is, sympathetic.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:09.120]   "Meek and lowly, come unto me," he says, "all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.080]   give you rest.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:18.160]   Come and take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart."
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.800]   He doesn't reject your candidates.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.480]   He doesn't dismiss your failures.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.680]   "Come," he says, "I've come for people like you.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:33.360]   The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:40.880]   So that when you see him and he comes near to you, you feel that at last here is someone
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.440]   who understands.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   You remember that what we are told about that poor man of Gadara who had a legion of
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.400]   devils within him?
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.760]   We are told that he spent his time up amongst the mountains and in the tombs, cutting himself
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   with stones.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.880]   He didn't want to be with people, and yet we are told that when he saw Jesus, he ran
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.800]   to him.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.440]   And everybody like that always did run to him.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.160]   Then drew nigh unto him.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.800]   Publicans and sinners sought to hear him.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.680]   He seemed to be a magnet, attracting them all.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.360]   Well, because he was what he was.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.640]   He looked different.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.920]   There was something about his face, his very stance, his whole approach.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.360]   There was something that oozed out sympathy and love divine.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:35.160]   He himself, of course, as usual, has given the perfect picture of it all in that parable
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.040]   of the Samaritan which I read to you at the beginning out of the tenth chapter of Luke's
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   Gospel.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.120]   There's the wounded man by the roadside.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.880]   The priest sees, turns away, goes on.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.200]   The Levite, no time, he must go and do his duty.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:56.040]   The other man comes, and he sees him, and he crosses the road, and he examines him,
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.000]   and he pours in oil and wine.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.760]   That's Christ.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.640]   That's a picture of the incarnation.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.040]   What is the Son of God doing in this world at all?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.800]   God says of him, "This is my beloved Son.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   Hear him.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.360]   He is the only begotten Son of God.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.200]   The eternal Son has entered into time.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.080]   He's walked the face of this earth.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   Why has he come?
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.320]   What's he doing here?"
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.880]   There's only one answer.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.320]   It is this divine compassion.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.760]   It is this eternal sympathy.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.080]   It is this grief in his eternal heart, if I may so say so.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:47.600]   As he looks upon men in failure and sin and shame, in sackcloth and ashes, he came down
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.640]   from heaven because of the sorrow of his heart.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.760]   That's why he was here at all.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:07.280]   So he begins to heal, you see, by just being what he is, the meek and lowly Jesus, God's
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:11.840]   eternal heart of love incarnate.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.480]   And he comes and takes his seat by the side of failures and miserable wretches in their
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.960]   rags.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.800]   When the Pharisees and scribes are rejecting him and arguing with him and throwing stones
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.000]   at him, he takes his place with the others, the harlots and the publicans.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.520]   He understands, he sympathizes.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.440]   He wouldn't have come into the world at all if men were a success.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.080]   It's because man is a failure and a hopeless failure that he's come at all.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.680]   His very presence begins to heal, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.800]   He not only shows that he understands, he comforts.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.240]   I like that picture that he uses in the case of the Samaritan.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:00.040]   The first thing he put into the wound was oil.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.620]   The first need is comfort and encouragement.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:10.080]   So that Isaiah, when he prophesied the coming of the Son of God, begins like this, "Comfort
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.320]   ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God."
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.640]   Comfort?
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.720]   We need it?
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.600]   We are hopeless, we are failures.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.880]   Can anything be done?
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.400]   The world can't help, men can't help, I can't help myself.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   Here is one who says, "I can."
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.040]   Listen.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.280]   Comfort.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.440]   But he hasn't merely come to comfort us.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.360]   Comfort is a wonderful thing, but it isn't enough.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.080]   Comfort while very precious doesn't solve the problem, it doesn't bind the heart together
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   again.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.160]   No, no, he has come to heal.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.440]   How does he heal?
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.120]   Well this is the wine that our Lord speaks of that the Samaritan put into the wound after
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.600]   he put in the oil.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.440]   You know this is the glory of the gospel, that it really does work.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.520]   It isn't something that makes you feel a little bit happier while you're listening to it and
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.520]   then you go back and are left to yourself and where you were before.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:15.920]   No, no, he says, "I have come to heal the brokenhearted, to put us right."
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:22.000]   The gospel of Christ is not palliative, it's curative.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.520]   It's not merely to encourage, I say, it's to deliver.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   How does he do it?
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.120]   Well he does it like this.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.600]   Let me tell you this glorious gospel once more.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:39.080]   The Lord Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth to deal with the disease itself, to
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   deal with sin.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:47.040]   Sin, I say, is the cause of all the troubles that separates us from God.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.120]   We are no longer blessed by God and therefore all our lives are in failure.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   Well what does he do?
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.920]   Well he has come to reconcile us to God.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.000]   There I sit in sacrifice and ashes bemoaning my failure.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.400]   I can't forgive myself.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.440]   I say, "How can God forgive me?"
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.560]   Christ comes and says, "Listen to me.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:11.040]   I came from heaven to earth to bear the responsibility of your sin.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   I took your sins upon me and your guilt and I bore your punishment on that cross on Calvary's
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   hill.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.360]   God has punished your sin in me and he gives you a free pardon.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.200]   Listen, believe that."
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.800]   That's how he does it.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:35.320]   And he thereby reconciles me to God and restores me to God's favor.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.440]   And God now smiles upon me and begins to bless me.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.640]   But not only that, he gives me also a new hope.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.560]   I say it's a wonderful thing to be told in that chapel that God forgives my sins, but
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.840]   I've got to go back again into the world and I know the world will be the same and I shall
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.680]   be tempted if not tonight, tomorrow, perhaps next week, in a month, in a year.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.040]   The devil is there and the world and its way.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.000]   How can I stand against it all?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.960]   That's what makes me feel so hopeless.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:13.600]   Listen, says Christ, "I have not only borne the consequences of your sin, I have come
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:23.200]   to give you a new life, a new nature, a new start, a new beginning.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.820]   I have come to make you a new man, a new woman."
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.820]   Now this is healing.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:34.080]   You see, merely to get rid of certain consequences isn't enough.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:42.640]   The disease must be got rid of and he gets rid of it by putting new life into us.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.840]   You can only overcome infection by building up resistance.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.460]   And he puts into you the resistance of himself and his own blessed life.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.240]   We are born of the Spirit, we are born again.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.840]   We become partakers of the divine nature.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:06.840]   Christ in us and the power of the Spirit to oust sin, to get rid of the pollution.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:13.880]   And he will build you up and he will strengthen you and he will establish you as you submit
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.800]   to his treatment.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:21.160]   And he will give you a new righteousness and a new holiness and a new life entirely.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:26.680]   And he will enable you to overcome the devil when he tempts you.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.480]   Now that is true healing, isn't it?
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:37.240]   You go out to the hospital a new man, the old disease has gone and you've got new health
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.960]   and strength and life and power.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.760]   And what's the inevitable result of all this?
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.680]   Well the result is you're a very happy person.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:54.160]   To appoint unto them that morn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   What's that mean?
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.320]   Yes, there was the man sitting in the dust and he'd put ashes on his head.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   What does Christ do?
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.240]   He brushes off the ashes and puts on instead a crown.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.520]   That's a better translation of this word beauty.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:15.760]   Or if you like, a tiara, a tiara for ashes, a crown for dust.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:23.120]   Stand up, he says, not only that, listen, the oil of joy for morning.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:29.760]   Stand upon your feet, he says, wash your face, oil it, put on the perfume, let it be redolent,
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.720]   let everybody know about it.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.960]   And the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:42.160]   Take off that sackcloth, says Christ, cease your mourning, put on a bright coloured garment
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.880]   fit for rejoicing and for happiness.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:50.200]   Come with me into the feast that we may rejoice together.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:58.840]   That's the real test of life and of health.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:05.080]   Once you've been healed of your disease, you no longer worry about it, do you?
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.360]   You no longer worry about it and spend your time in thinking about it?
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.940]   Not at all.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.280]   You walk out of the hospital and you go home and you say, now then, I'm going to show
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.520]   you how well I am.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.400]   You run up the stairs, you could scarcely crawl up them before.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.800]   You want everybody to know it.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.440]   You're rejoicing, you're happy.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.920]   What a wonderful thing, you say.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.520]   It is to be healthy again and full of vigour and of power.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   Rejoice with me.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.600]   The psychology of this passage in Isaiah is very profound.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.240]   And I want to put it to you like this.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.880]   You are not healed by Christ unless you are rejoicing.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.800]   It's an absolute test.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.580]   If you are not rejoicing in Christ tonight and in your salvation, there's something
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.920]   wrong somewhere with your healing.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.360]   You're not trusting him at some point or other.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.160]   You're saying, oh yes, but, and the moment you say that, you're back on the floor with
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.360]   the sackcloth and the ashes.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.200]   No, no, he wants you to rejoice.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   He heals.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   It's a perfect work.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   It's a complete work.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:21.280]   The oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.440]   Are you still subject to the spirit of heaviness?
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.680]   Are you sad and doubtful and hesitant and mourning?
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.160]   You say, well, I do believe in Christ, but you know my sins, my friend, can't you see
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.120]   he's covered them all?
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.960]   Are you still trying to work up your own righteousness?
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.680]   You see, you must rely only upon him, and that if you do rely upon him, you can say
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.600]   with top lady, the terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:52.080]   My Savior's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from you.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.920]   No, no, you're not properly healed unless you're rejoicing.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:02.120]   Are you rejoicing, I ask?
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.800]   This is how Charles Wesley again puts it.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:17.520]   He speaks, Christ speaks, and listening to his voice, new life the dead receive, the
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:26.800]   mournful broken hearts rejoice, the humble poor believe.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:38.680]   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise, the triumphs of my God
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:47.320]   and King, the glory, the glory of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.000]   Are you one of the triumphs of his grace?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.800]   Has he healed you?
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.280]   Is your mournful broken heart that was rejoicing in him?
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.720]   That's what he's come to do.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.640]   And if you truly listen to him, he will lead you to that.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:14.720]   The Paul who cried out in agony, "Oh, wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.360]   body of this death?"
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:26.080]   immediately adds, "I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord."
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:31.720]   My friend, are you thanking God through Jesus Christ?
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.240]   Are you realizing that he was sent and came from heaven and to earth in order to heal
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   you?
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.680]   Have you seen your desperate need?
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   And have you believed him when he has told you that he can heal you completely and enable
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.080]   you to rejoice in him?
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:06.040]   If not, I say, read your Bible again, read the lives of the saints, and give yourself
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:16.480]   no rest nor peace until you've seen the sin in your heart, and then turn to him and submit
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.920]   yourself to him.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:27.080]   And tell him to have his own way with you, and he will heal your diseases and put a new
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:37.040]   song in your mouth and in your heart, and you will go after him rejoicing, clothed with
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.160]   the garments of Zion.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.200]   Amen.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
