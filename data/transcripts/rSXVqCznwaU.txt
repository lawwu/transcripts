[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Well, this is what I call the tyranny of must-have.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.320]   You say to somebody, "How would you like to be financially independent?
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.200]   You have enough money, you never have to work again."
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.440]   I don't think too many people are going to say, "No, I wouldn't want that."
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   You know, I mean, everybody's going to say, "Well, that sounds great, but are you willing
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280]   to pay the price?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.680]   Are you willing to do the work?"
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.800]   "Yeah, you know, that sounds great, but I've got to keep this expensive house I have because
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.480]   we need to have the two least luxury cars, and of course, kids have to go to the private
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.600]   schools," and the list goes on and on, and that's the tyranny of must-haves.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.320]   The more must-haves you have, the less likely you are to be financially independent.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.820]   If somebody says, "Yeah, you know, I really want to start a business, but I don't want
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.840]   to give up my nights and weekends, and I want to go to two-hour lunches," it has to be perhaps
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.140]   the most important thing to you.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.160]   So for me, there was nothing that my money could buy that was more valuable to me than
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.960]   my financial freedom than my independence.
