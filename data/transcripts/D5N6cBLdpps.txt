[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380]   Um, all right.
[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.540]   So I got a question from me.
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.060]   Hmm.
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.760]   As long as I have you, uh, in the studio from
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.520]   me on behalf of my listeners.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.420]   Uh, so you've spent most of your career as a
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780]   journalist and freelance journalist, writer of
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.940]   books, you're on, this is four or five, five,
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.180]   five, okay.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.180]   Five books.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.760]   Um, you've got cool stories, right?
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.740]   I mean, you reported from talk about earlier,
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.340]   you were stationed in Argentina earlier in
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.500]   your career, you did a book about Jewish delis
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500]   where you were traveling the seaboard,
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.700]   trying out different delis for revenge of
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.980]   analog, you went to all these cool places.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.500]   It was first person journalistic.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500]   A lot of the article.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.560]   This is, I think, romantic to a certain
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.060]   subset of my listeners.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.080]   The idea, the autonomy and the adventure of
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580]   being a writer, traveling, going to interesting
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.280]   places, being able to write books about it,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.500]   then to be able to like travel and like
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900]   you're seeing me now because you're traveling,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900]   talking about the book, right?
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.700]   This is romantic.
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.420]   Um, and we know that this is romantic.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.500]   It's well, yeah.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.220]   We've been talking about the sex spurts and
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.660]   now we're going to talk about the romance of
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.660]   David and I being in the same room.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.460]   Um, so what I'm wondering here is like,
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.340]   let's, uh, let's say two answers.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.560]   What's the reality checks?
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.920]   Like what's the elements that, okay, it's
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.420]   not as romantic as you think, but so that
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.860]   we're not too dour, maybe give us a taste
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.940]   of what actually is as cool as you might
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940]   think about this sort of full-time
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.420]   autonomous writer's lifestyle.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.620]   So the, the, the negative side, cause
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.420]   you know, I get this a lot.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.300]   I'm, I'm a mentor at my old university.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.660]   So I have all these students and they
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.580]   don't have a writing program or journalism.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.940]   So they send them to me, right.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.060]   The wayward souls.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.100]   Um, it's look, it's, it's, it's a difficult
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.740]   way to make a consistent living, uh,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.020]   financially speaking.
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.540]   Um, you know, the financial rewards are
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500]   not steady and consistent.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.900]   I'm someone who's successful at it
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.940]   relatively speaking.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.980]   Um, but you know, it took me a
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.180]   while to get where I am.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.140]   And that happened as the sort of industry,
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.580]   especially the magazine and newspaper
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.100]   industry has, has imploded as this sort
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.620]   of ad sales.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.860]   It's the reality now you really need is
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.180]   books and speaking, what's going to be the.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.860]   The primary income source is the, is the
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.940]   freelance writing fees small enough now,
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.980]   if you're going to make a go at this, you
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.380]   can't imagine it's just going to be from
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.540]   the magazine piece of what's the...
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.220]   No, yeah, that, that, those days are done.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.980]   Um, I think there are people who, who
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.460]   still manage to eat that out, but they're
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.420]   doing other things.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.020]   Um, books are relatively
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.140]   consistent and steady.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.100]   Um, and the speaking, you know, relates
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.980]   to the success of the books or, or the
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.580]   topics of them.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.900]   And that's always, that's always sort of
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.180]   good.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420]   Um, so that's, that's the downside.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.580]   And then there's of course, all the
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.060]   downsides of being a writer, um, the
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.460]   rollercoaster of emotions and, you know,
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.460]   self-hatred and, you know, my book came out
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.780]   today and last night was amazing.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.660]   We did a great event.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.580]   You, you, the, the, the, the, the, the
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.260]   sun God of Cal Newportness just brought
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.300]   all these wonderful people from DC who were
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   friends of yours, fans of yours, listeners
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.660]   of yours.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.180]   Um.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.100]   Hometown, hometown crowd.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.980]   Hometown crowd.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.980]   You, you brought it, you brought it.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.940]   And, uh, and it was a wonderful way to kick
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.620]   off this book tour.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.260]   And then it was today, it was like, oh,
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.180]   someone isn't responding to my email about
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.540]   an op-ed and wah, like, you know, I'm like,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.900]   well, maybe I'll just click on the Amazon.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.380]   It's like, you don't click on the Amazon
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.460]   ranking on your first day.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.100]   I'm like, well, I.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.340]   You can't.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.180]   My book's 124,000.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.100]   So that's, oh no, forget it.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.060]   Um.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.580]   But it was 126,000.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.660]   So I think that's what's important.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660]   It's on the up and up.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.620]   It's a mover.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.020]   It's on the up and up.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.260]   It's a mover and shaker.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.980]   So that's.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.860]   You can, you can get infinitely discerning by
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.860]   the way that with your Amazon, like, well,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.300]   it moving in shakers in this category on
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.500]   Tuesdays was actually in the top 1000.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.900]   There you go.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900]   There's always a one, uh, a number one thing.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.020]   Right.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.100]   But up and down, up and down.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.620]   But I think, you know, the, the, the thing
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.820]   that I always tell people is like, when you,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.020]   if you're able to do it in a way that you're
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.500]   able to support yourself and like, I'm not
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.860]   advocating that, like you should do it and
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.460]   lose all your money.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.340]   That's ridiculous.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.940]   But like you gain the ultimate freedom and access.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.860]   You've never had a normal job.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.300]   Is that right?
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.020]   I've never had a normal job.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.420]   You've never gone into an office
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.620]   building on a regular basis.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.420]   I had one job when I was in my first
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.540]   summer of university.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.740]   Um, that was a regular job.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.580]   I got a job at a office that made newsletters
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.020]   for dentists in Toronto.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.300]   So you've had two different dream careers.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.220]   Is what you're saying.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.660]   My job, I went the first day.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.140]   I'm like, okay, like I want to be a journalist.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.660]   I'm going to write these stories about dentists.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.660]   You're like, nope, you're going to go in this room.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.820]   Here's a stack of the newsletters.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.340]   Here's a printout of like, um, the addresses.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.660]   You're going to tape the address onto the
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.780]   newsletter here, where it says, or the name
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.020]   of the dentist, Dr.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.980]   Calvin Newport, you know, 606, whatever way.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.860]   Um, you're going to place this on this
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.220]   Canon image runner copier, and you're going
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.260]   to make 200 copies of that one.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.540]   And you're gonna make 300 copies of that one.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.020]   And you can do this all day, eight hours a day,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.820]   seven days a week in this windowless room
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.940]   until the day when you notice smoke coming
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.180]   from the Cam and Gin runner.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.900]   Cause you've been running it so hot and so
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.940]   much, you've been slamming those copies
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.420]   that it catches on fire.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.420]   And the guy from Canon comes in.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.940]   He's like, I have never seen anything like
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.060]   this.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.780]   And then you're moved to data entry.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.860]   Uh, by the way, I love your dream
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.140]   denied in this story is writing
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.300]   articles about dentists.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.460]   I would probably still be at that company.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   This is what was taken from you.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.740]   So anyway, that was, yeah.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.100]   Yes.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.060]   So I've never had that.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.300]   Right.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.540]   So, so what have I gotten out of, out of my
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.380]   career when, you know, other friends of mine
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.580]   have had more steady jobs or even steadier
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.460]   careers in journalism.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.980]   Like my friend, Mike came out to the bar last
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.020]   night, he works for Reuters.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.540]   He's like a beat reporter on defense.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.860]   Right.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.700]   And he's like, I, he was like, you know, I
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.540]   loved, I would love to do what you do.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820]   It's I have the freedom to go anywhere and
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.420]   do what I want.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.300]   And as long as someone is willing to let me
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.220]   go there and say, yeah, you can come to my
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.260]   restaurant, interview me.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.540]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.500]   You can come to the, the record pressing plant
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.860]   in Nashville and walk around with us.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.620]   You know, you can, you can come to Jack
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.740]   White's recording studio and, and talk to
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.700]   his people and, and see how he does all that
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.100]   stuff.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.780]   Um, then I'm good to go and no one's telling
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.540]   me what to do.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.460]   I can ask whatever questions I want.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.100]   I get to have conversations with anyone I
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.580]   want anywhere in the world, um, uh, without
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.540]   limitations on them.
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.660]   So.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.980]   So, so what's the game plan then if let's say.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.620]   Game plan.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.300]   Undergraduate.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.580]   I'm invite, I do advice here.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.300]   We get specific.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.260]   Let's say you're an, a college student and
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.780]   the goal is I want to write nonfiction books
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.940]   that'll allow me to go to interesting places
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.900]   and report an interesting thing.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.060]   So, so like the books you write.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.540]   Um, how do you maximize the chance that
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.860]   you're like, okay, I want to give you a game
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.900]   plan, no guarantees, but let me build
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.260]   from pull from David, my David Sacks wisdom.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.060]   And like, this is what you should, this is
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.540]   the steps.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.420]   Here's what you should focus on.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.340]   What are you, what are you telling that
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.660]   student?
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.220]   This is what I tell, um, the students that I
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.620]   mentor.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.660]   So the same thing, right.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.860]   Is, uh, there's many different paths to it.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.900]   So there's no one way.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.740]   Um, don't go to journalism school, uh, because
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.420]   you're just going to spend a lot of money
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.980]   sort of doing stuff that you can learn as a
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.140]   trade, um, right.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.060]   Wherever and however you can.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.060]   So if you can get an internship or you can
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.500]   sell stories to your local hometown paper or
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.540]   website or, you know, some other thing, do it.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.820]   Right.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.100]   The more you write, start a blog, start a
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.820]   sub stack thing.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820]   Um, right, right, right.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.940]   Because first you're going to just have to
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.700]   learn how to do that and learn how to pitch
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.060]   your ideas to people, which is the most
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.740]   important part.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.260]   And then you're going to have to figure out
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.340]   what you're actually interested in writing
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.540]   about and what you're good at.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.540]   Like you're going to have to develop some sort
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.660]   of niche or expertise.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.820]   And that doesn't mean you have to spend like
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.820]   20 years studying, you know, Etruscan ruins.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.620]   Um, but you're going to have to develop a
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.300]   knowledge around a certain area so that you
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.060]   see an idea that's big enough for a book when
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.540]   it comes to it.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.860]   Right.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.300]   So when you're, when you're selling that book,
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.140]   if you can point to your journalism profile,
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.780]   and even if it's a lot of small things, it may
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.020]   be a bigger thing here and there.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.260]   If there's a clear thread through it, you
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.460]   know, I'm writing about outdoor adventure
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.180]   sports a lot.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.620]   Like I'm, I'm in these places.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.700]   Then when you pitch the book on that, like,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.460]   okay, this makes sense.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.140]   This tracks.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.140]   It makes sense that this person is, but you
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.620]   have to give them that thread.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.100]   Why does it make sense that this person is
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.900]   writing this book?
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.500]   Exactly.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.580]   And sometimes, you know, you have to convince
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.060]   them, right?
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.260]   Like I, my first book was about, um, it's
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.140]   called Save the Deli and it was about, you
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.300]   know, why were Jewish deli disappearing and
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.100]   why, why did that matter?
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.460]   And what were the cultural forces?
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.300]   I mean, I, I came up with the idea when I was
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.940]   in university and it was a paper I wrote for a
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.660]   class.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.820]   Um, and when I pitched it, I was, I don't
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.820]   know, 25, 26 years old.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.780]   And it was like, well, why is this guy doing
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:51.900]   it?
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.700]   Well, I'm like, look, I I'm interested in food.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.940]   Here's a few things I've written, but it was
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.020]   like, okay, well, he understands this idea
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.420]   enough.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.220]   We can see in his writing that he knows how
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.540]   to write this, or we're going to take a chance
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:00.740]   on it.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.580]   Um, it actually gets harder as you get more
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.260]   successful because you have a track record
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.580]   and they're like, oh, Cal Newport, you're the
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.660]   digital minimalism, digital work guy.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.060]   What do you mean you want to write a book
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.860]   about like 19th century ballet?
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.100]   Look, man, like that's, yeah, we'll give you
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.900]   a flyer or whatever, but, um, you know, this
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.580]   is the goods like you're, you're, this is the
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.780]   industry, right?
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.860]   No, it's hard.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.540]   I mean, I remember when Ryan Holiday years ago,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.980]   I first heard that he was going to write a book
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.780]   on stoicism.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.100]   I was like, come on, why are you writing a book
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.660]   on stoicism?
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.140]   Your last book was about marketing.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.260]   You're in the marketing world.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.580]   You did this growth hacking ebook, like that
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.340]   is your world.
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.100]   This is a crazy idea.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.100]   And this is why I'm terrible at giving advice
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.580]   to people, but he had a hard time.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.540]   I asked about that on the show.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:44.900]   Exactly.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.020]   What you're talking about is publishers like,
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.340]   I guess we'll publish this.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.860]   We're not going to pay you much for it.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.100]   Right.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.740]   Kind of annoyed about it because we want to get
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.300]   back to what you're doing.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.140]   Quantity for.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.660]   But I think, and that's the thing about the
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.980]   freelance writer, like just as soon as you get
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.420]   that sort of success around it, people like,
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:09:59.900]   oh, good.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.820]   You're the analog guy.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.500]   I'm like, yeah, but I'm going to throw you a
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.260]   curve ball now.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.300]   Cause like, I don't want to be put in some sort
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.140]   of hole where I'm writing the same book over
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.940]   and over and over and over and over again.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.140]   Um, and, and you see that and there's people
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.460]   who are successful at kind of weaving through
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.620]   that, like, you know, Rich Cohen.
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.620]   Uh, name sounds familiar.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.300]   Rich Cohen's written many books.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.260]   Um, he's also written for vanity fair whenever,
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.820]   and he's always just like something that
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.940]   interests him and something different.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.100]   And he's like, some stuff sells more and some
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.780]   stuff sells less.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.340]   He's like, but I'm following the thing that I
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.980]   want to write about.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.580]   And that's the, that's, that has to be the
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.100]   definition of success because the commercial
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.860]   success is so out of your control.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.340]   It's very hard.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.540]   It's very hard.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.460]   And then try to like consistently have high
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.060]   commercial success.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.900]   That's like a whole different, that's a whole
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.820]   different type of career.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.580]   I'm like half in that world and it's a, it's a
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.620]   lot of, it's a lot of hard work, but it's a lot
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.100]   of managing, uh, it reminds me of film, film
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.660]   directing.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.500]   It's like a kind of a complicated thing for
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.140]   the film director.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.380]   So, you know, like this movie was very
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.180]   successful and having to navigate the projects.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.900]   And if this movie doesn't do well, I have one
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.020]   more I can do to try to prove it.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.300]   It's a complicated and it's not a straight
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.020]   linear thing.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.420]   Right.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.380]   And I think the expectation that it should be
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.060]   that success is this straight linear thing of
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.540]   like, this thing is going to do this.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.700]   And then the next one's going to do better.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.820]   And the next one's going to do better.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.420]   It doesn't work like that.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.260]   And so, you know, there is an element of like
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.500]   artistry to it.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.980]   And I don't mean we're artists, but it is this
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.180]   type of thing where it's, where it's like at the
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.900]   end of the day, the, the goal, the goal is not
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.460]   to lose money.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.060]   You still want to make enough money to like
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.260]   afford the Subaru and its gas.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.980]   Um, uh, but you know, you, you, you don't want
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.580]   to give up that independence cause that's the
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.300]   thing that got you into it in the first place.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.620]   Um, so it's like the nonfiction axiom, I say
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.740]   nonfiction, like selling seven figure copies of
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.100]   a book.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.740]   It's like hitting a major league fastball.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.700]   It's like one of the most difficult things to
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.220]   do and no one can do it all the time.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.260]   There is a handful of writers out there, you
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.420]   know, nonfiction like Malcolm Gladwell, Michael
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.580]   Lewis, but you know, they're not moving seven
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.940]   figures.
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.260]   Okay.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.700]   Then no.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.820]   How about it's hard.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.700]   Well, but then some people do it's this, what's
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.060]   so hard?
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.980]   Like it's, it's very feast or family.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.860]   Like a James Clear will move 4 million copies.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.140]   See, I don't even know who that is.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.180]   Atomic habits.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.060]   Okay.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:22.460]   Right.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.340]   Mark Manson, 18 million copies.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.020]   The business book.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.780]   But like no one can consistently.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.580]   Celebrities don't count.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:27.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.060]   Uh, that's right.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.820]   But celebrities don't consistently write books.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.700]   So like it's very, in fiction, you can do it.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.060]   You can be Grisham in the nineties.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.740]   Grisham in the nineties.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.980]   And you're going to move a lot, but he wasn't.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.860]   Yeah, I guess he was moving seven figures
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.740]   pretty consistently.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.260]   Uh, units.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.980]   Units.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.620]   Units.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.100]   Units.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.740]   SKUs.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:44.980]   SKUs.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.260]   SKUs of SKUs.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.060]   SKUs of Southern lawyers.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.260]   So you can go crazy.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.500]   You can go crazy chasing that.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:50.740]   Like.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.300]   But it's out of your control, right?
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.340]   I don't think Stephen King's like thinks like that.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.420]   And I'm sure his books are up and down.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.900]   I mean, they also a lot of copies, but.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.700]   I think some kill it and some.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.300]   Sedaris.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.860]   Sedaris.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.740]   Sedaris probably the same way.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.660]   No, I think Sedaris just gets out there,
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.700]   tell some crazy stories about his family
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.780]   and then goes on tour and, you know, charges
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.900]   like 50 bucks a ticket to go see him.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.300]   And.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.740]   Well, that's why he doesn't care about like.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.780]   The books have to do well and they do well.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.820]   But like he loves touring and he makes a lot of money.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.900]   And what does he have to spend his money on,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.620]   but like a new stick to pick up garbage
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.260]   with in England?
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:20.860]   Like it's.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.180]   I mean, don't they have, doesn't him and Hugh
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.620]   have like a.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.140]   They have many.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.980]   French countryside house and an English house.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.020]   We could geek out on Sedaris all day here.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.940]   Well, I've been trying to get them on the show.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.380]   I can't imagine what, no I'm joking.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.340]   It's like, huh.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.660]   Productivity, digital culture.
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.700]   This is right in my wheelhouse.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.380]   I'm sure he, he does write about how he works.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.140]   And, uh, he has a very specific way about it.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.300]   Be great.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.380]   But you wouldn't get him.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:44.900]   All right.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.460]   So that's good advice.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.580]   So, um, the summarize then I always paraphrase.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.740]   So you're, so you're saying, uh, the book
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.340]   writing, it's hard, financially hard, but you
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.580]   can make a living at it.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.780]   It has its pluses and minuses.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.220]   If you want to get into it, right,
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.060]   journalistically, right.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.700]   Articles anywhere you can develop a niche.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.340]   Then that's super tight.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.700]   But I will say the other thing, there's
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.820]   the other path to it too.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.180]   Yes.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.300]   Go live your life, go have another career
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.540]   and then write on the side, right.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.820]   For, you know, a magazine for a hobby you
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.020]   have or a blog or something like that.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.860]   And then later on, when you feel like you
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.180]   have an experience or something to tell,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.100]   you're going to have that lived experience.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.060]   That's that is it.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.540]   So it's not just writers who get to do that.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.340]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:31.820]   Lives.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.820]   And if you want to write pragmatic nonfiction,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.580]   then do something that's useful and then you
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.220]   can write about it.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.260]   That's easier.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.660]   If I want to give advice on something, uh,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.300]   go do that thing.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.060]   Well, it's like a much easier formula than if
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.460]   you want to report on Jewish delis, like,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.660]   what can this person write?
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.740]   And does, you know, as it makes sense,
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.340]   he'll be right on that.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.060]   Right.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.220]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.140]   All right.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.660]   Well, David, this is a, this has been great.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.300]   This has been useful.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.980]   Thanks for stopping by the studio and help me
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.260]   tackle some of these questions.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.180]   And, um, I think we have to go find a deli.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.020]   I think we do.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.980]   It's a pleasure.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.700]   Great to be here.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.180]   I'm freezing.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.980]   Turn the heat up.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.340]   [music]
