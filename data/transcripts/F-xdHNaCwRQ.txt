[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   >> Yeah, I've always noticed that there are certain muscle groups that are very easy to
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   isolate when under load and those are almost always the same muscle groups that are easy
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.040]   to contract very hard without any load whatsoever.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.040]   >> Bingo.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.740]   That's actually really insightful.
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.900]   You can use this heuristic of if you can contract your lats just standing here, you're probably
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.780]   going to contract them very well when you lift.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.380]   If you can't, you can probably assume about the same thing's going to happen.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.820]   So yeah, you'll know.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.140]   The lats are actually really interesting because they tend to be one of the more difficult
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.580]   muscle groups to learn how to activate.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.660]   So if you're in your journey and you're just like, I have no idea and you can look up like
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.260]   a lat pose.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.740]   So how do you like, how do you puff your lats up?
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740]   How do you show it?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.520]   And if you do that and you're like, wow, there's no movement here, just recognize that's extremely
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.300]   common and that it's probably going to take you many, many, many months of trying before
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.500]   you start to see some movements and probably even a few years before you really start to
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   see activation.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.140]   So you're not some sort of like specific, like special genetic anomaly.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.340]   It's very, very common.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.560]   It's uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps, right?
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560]   Everyone can do that.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.980]   But if you're just like, man, I can't get this here.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.260]   I'm just going to stop doing it.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.260]   Do not do that.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.560]   Just keep at it and just keep concentrating and thinking about that muscle group.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   It will take some time.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740]   But it's very common to have challenges activating lats.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.580]   I've noticed that many of the muscle groups that were responsible for a large fraction
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.780]   of the work in the various sports that I played as a young child are muscles that are very
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.820]   easy for me to selectively isolate and induce hypertrophy in.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.420]   I suppose I'm one of those mutants where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.420]   groups.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.820]   I think that's because I swam a lot when I was a kid.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.660]   Literally going to ask me a swimmer.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.660]   It's like a telltale sign.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.660]   Every kid in my town swam and played soccer.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.660]   There you go.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.740]   And then later I skateboarded and did some boxing and things of that sort.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.380]   You generally hear that answer is you either were a swimmer or you were a wrestler.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.100]   So it's like that pulling and pull toward you is thousands of repetitions allowed you
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.780]   to get very good at contracting.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.340]   But because I also played soccer and skateboarding, but I didn't do any baseball, basketball or
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.820]   anything, muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging to activate and isolate.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.180]   So I do think that early development is superimposed on a genetic template that sort of predicts
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.660]   which muscle groups are going to be easier or harder to isolate and train.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.780]   It's also a very good case for why it's important to do as many different athletic activities
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.380]   as you can in your youth.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.180]   And if you do skateboard, definitely learn to ride switch because every skateboarder
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.500]   I know has one leg that's larger than the other and one calf that's larger than the
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   other.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.300]   And actually for that matter, people that do martial arts that don't learn to, if they're
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.580]   not southpaw, if they don't learn to switch up and do their work southpaw, you see the
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.580]   same thing.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.380]   I mean, you're building an asymmetry into the system and it's not just muscular, it's
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380]   neural.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.380]   Oh, for sure.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.380]   It's strongly neural.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.060]   So yeah, kids, parents, get your kids doing a bunch of different things.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.660]   I suppose gymnastics would probably be the best sport all around in terms of movement
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.620]   in multiple planes and activating all the different muscle groups.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.380]   Yes and no.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.660]   There's a lot of benefit, no question about it.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.260]   There's a lot of other things though that it has limited ability.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.540]   So almost everything in, not like gymnastics is great, but almost everything in that is
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.420]   pre-planned, which is a major downfall, right?
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.300]   So the joy of skating is there's so much proprioceptive input that you have to make decisions very
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.580]   quickly in small windows.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.020]   Now you have a little bit of that when you're flipping in the air and you have to land,
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.500]   but you, gymnastics, gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine that they're working
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380]   on and they work on that routine for years.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.180]   So skateboarding for me was transportation.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.460]   It was freedom and it didn't require any coaches or parental oversight.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.500]   Ball sports have the beauty of reaction and things like that.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.900]   So all of them are wonderful.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500]   Good to do a lot of them.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.060]   You've established that 10 really to 20 sets per week is the kind of bounds for maintaining
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.100]   and initiating hypertrophy.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.100]   Yep.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.980]   If I were to like flag one of them, I would say 15 to 20 is the sets that you want to
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.180]   get working now.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.580]   It gets complicated when you ask, well, how many reps per set do I have to get to?
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.580]   Okay.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.740]   Well, we also can complicate that by repetition type and tempo.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.420]   Just sort of let all that go for now and just think if you're getting close to that range,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.780]   you're in the spot and all you have to do now is balance two things, recovery and continued
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780]   training.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.780]   Okay.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.540]   So if you're somewhere in this 10 to 20 working sets range and you're in a position where
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.700]   you can continue to do that, you're not so sore and so damaged and beat up that you can't
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.740]   maintain that volume for, you know, eight weeks at a time or at least six weeks at a
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.180]   time, then I'd probably say either the style of repetitions, the amount of repetitions
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.660]   per set you're doing are too much.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.940]   The volume is getting to you.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.860]   However, if you're not seeing adaptations, then I'd say maybe the repetitions aren't
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.220]   enough.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.180]   And so that's the kind of game you're running.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   Now there could be plenty of other factors.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   Intensity.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   Of course.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.500]   Yeah, intensity, intent, and then of course the other things, sleep, nutrition, et cetera.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.900]   All these other things that go into our visible stressor category that we always analyze.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.660]   This sort of brings up this idea of responders and non-responders.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.780]   So we get this one a ton.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.740]   So why is it some people, my gym buddy, my roommate, we go to sleep at the same time,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.300]   we're on the same nutrition plan, we work out together, she triples in muscle size and
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.060]   I don't have like no gain whatsoever.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.660]   Well there's a lot of work that we're trying to do to identify the molecular mechanisms
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.020]   behind responders and non-responders because they clearly exist.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.820]   In fact, this is one of the reasons why every paper I basically will ever publish again
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.500]   if I, you know, if I do, always reports individual person data.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.620]   So rather than group averages, you get to see, you know, if there's 10 subjects in it,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.380]   you get to see how each of the 10 responded.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.860]   Because the group average can get confusing, what you really want to see is how many actually
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.240]   people got better, how many got worse, how many maybe changed and if so.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.580]   So we'll always report those individual data because when you go to train, you're you,
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.820]   you're not the group average.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.700]   That's very important to know.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.140]   So if you do that, you can see a beautiful line of these hyper-responders, the bell curve
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.480]   in the middle of the normal responders and those folks who like through any training
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.260]   study just won't get any better.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.420]   If you can tease out what you can't, but let's say in science you could tease out all the
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.860]   extra factors, total stress load, hydration, sleep, etc.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.340]   What you often see is non-responders a lot of the time, it's not that they have a physiological
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.660]   inability, it's just that they need a different protocol.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.100]   And a lot of times it's they just need more volume.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.020]   So if they can handle that and they're not excessively beat up, just give them more volume
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.700]   and they tend to see a lot of breakthroughs.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.380]   And you see the same thing with plateaus.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.980]   So typically it's sort of just like, okay, the routine you're on, you've been on it for
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.240]   too long.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.900]   We need to either go to the other end of the hypertrophy spectrum for intensity, which
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.460]   means like if you've been in the like 60 to 70% of your one repetition max range, maybe
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.140]   we actually need to go heavier.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.160]   Take our repetitions down, maybe even our total volume down and go heavier.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   Try that.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.900]   A great way to break through plateaus of grand if all the other boxes are checked.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.020]   The other one is do the opposite, which is like, okay, we're going to go higher.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.420]   We're going to go set to 20, set to 25, very high repetition range and really get after
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.420]   it.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.700]   Not to do as much damage because you don't tend to get as sore from those really high
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.140]   repetition ranges.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.740]   You'll get more sore from the lower repetition, higher intensity range than you will typically
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.420]   the other ones and see if we can bust through some plateaus there.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.700]   So it just generally means you need to do something a little bit different than your
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:04.860]   training partner.
