[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.160]   Longtime listener and first time asking the question here.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.560]   I'm quite fascinated by reading your articles,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160]   neither the New York Times or your books.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.280]   You have so much references.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.040]   So the question is, how do you keep
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.280]   track of all the references?
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   Do you have a method?
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.120]   Let's say if you were to read a book or article
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.800]   and then you find a quote, how do you store them
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.120]   or how do you keep them so that you can refer back
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.760]   when you are doing an article?
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.920]   Anyways, I'd like to know your method
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.040]   and look forward to hearing.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.160]   Thank you for all the good work you do.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.400]   Cheers.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.000]   Well, when it comes to information management
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.240]   of this type, there's two big schools of thought--
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.080]   proactive or reactive.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.720]   So the proactive information managers
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.320]   want to take the information they encounter
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.280]   when they first encounter it and put it
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.960]   into some sort of system, even before they necessarily
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.920]   have a specific use for that information.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.000]   They want to get it into a system
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.680]   where it can later be retrieved if needed.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.560]   And in the more advanced version of those proactive systems
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.720]   where new novel connections can form that themselves might even
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   help give you ideas about what you should be writing about.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.960]   So this is a really big idea right now.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.680]   A lot of the proactive systems you might hear about
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.560]   are inspired, generally speaking,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.120]   by the Zettelkasten system, where
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.280]   you have contextual links between different pieces
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120]   of information.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.200]   Information are like nodes in a graph
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.800]   and you have edges that connect them.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.080]   Through these connections, you can find information
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.560]   serendipitously.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.240]   Second brain is a concept like this.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.360]   You might have seen--
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   I think this is Diego Forte's second brain
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.000]   is one example of this.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.760]   When I had Srini Rao on the show, I interviewed Srini Rao,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.120]   he talked about his use of a particular Zettelkasten-style
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.800]   note-taking system that he actually had generate for him,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.960]   basically, article ideas.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.400]   He finds interesting connections,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.680]   then all the information he needs is there.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.080]   I largely do not use proactive systems.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   There's an overhead to them that I haven't yet gotten over.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   There's a lot of overhead to getting that information
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.320]   in there.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.440]   My time is quite limited.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.240]   So I often don't have or feel like I
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.640]   have that time to sit back and extract things
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.760]   from the books I'm reading or articles that I'm reading.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.680]   I'm not saying it wouldn't work for me,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.360]   it's just I haven't done it.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.160]   I am more of the reactive camp, which is a much more minimalist
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   approach.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.080]   And the reactive camp is, I'm working on this.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.400]   I got to get a lot of information
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.720]   to help support this thing that I'm working on.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.360]   And you go out there and you find some information
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.040]   for that thing, and then you work on it,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.360]   and you have all that information right there to cite.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Almost always, that's how my writing comes together.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.080]   If I'm working on an article, then I
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760]   will go out there and find sources I need for that article,
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   and I will keep track of them right there in Scrivener,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.960]   in my research folder, link, link, link, link, link, link,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.560]   link, and they're all right there.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   That goes to the fact checker.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.560]   That's where all the citations come from.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.760]   If I'm working on a book chapter, similar,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   I have a rough outline of what I want there.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.000]   That outline might have some sources in mind.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.280]   But then I go out when I'm working on that book chapter
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400]   and find those books and find the articles
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.440]   and talk to the people.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.800]   And I keep track of right there for this chapter.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.120]   Here's all the different sources I used.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.480]   Often, I'll just footnote as I write.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.560]   OK, here's the source.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.360]   Here's that source.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.400]   Here's this source.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280]   And I do it on demand.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.720]   Now, there's little hacks in here.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.160]   So when I'm book writing, for example,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.920]   I will use shorthand for my references.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.600]   Maybe I'll just mention the PDF name of the article I cited
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   or a brief description of the book title.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.680]   I tend to then hire an editor to come in later and actually
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.360]   clean up all of those references to be in the proper style
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.520]   citation so that--
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.400]   there's some hacks.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.880]   There's some technical hacks there.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.600]   But I'm not drawing from some very large second brain
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.360]   Zetalcast and inspired system to get those references.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.880]   I find them as I need them.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.720]   Now, what happens here is that over time,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.080]   if you write enough things and you have put together
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.040]   enough creative ideas, you have been
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.680]   bathed in a lot of interesting notions.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080]   You've been bathed in a lot of interesting citations.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.480]   You've been bathed in a lot of interesting case studies.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.440]   And your brain itself implicitly implements
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.120]   some sort of Zetalcast and type system.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.660]   So then when it comes time, if you've
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.120]   been a writer for 10 years, to do
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.080]   a chapter for a book on a certain topic,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.880]   already off the top of your head,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.160]   you get five or six good starting points.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.880]   Oh, I should use an example from Lincoln.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.120]   And I remember listening to a thing about Thoreau.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.640]   And oh, and I wrote about this guy before.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.100]   And there's some stuff I learned about him that I never really
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.980]   got around to using.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.140]   I tend to find that stuff is relatively accessible
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.760]   and it pops up.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.880]   And it's a good starting point.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.920]   And you start with those sources,
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.340]   and those lead you to new sources.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.800]   So your brain itself actually can
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.120]   do a good job of implementing what a lot of these systems
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.200]   are trying to replace.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   And so that's how I do it.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.560]   It's incredibly low overhead.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.040]   I'm exposed to a lot of information.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.600]   I remember a lot of stuff.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.920]   That's my starting point.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.960]   But when it comes time to write something,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.120]   that is when, in the moment, I begin to more systematically
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   try to find sources.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.720]   Storm right there where I'm working.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.760]   It all happens more or less on demand.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.740]   It may not be the most elegant system.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.740]   It may not be the most serendipity, promoting,
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.060]   supporting type system.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.420]   But it's very low overhead.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.340]   And so far, it seems to work.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.400]   (upbeat music)
