[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   A really important question comes in from a listener named Nicholas, who went to
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.400]   the Ask Pastor John homepage and emailed us this question. Hi Pastor John.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.100]   In Hebrews 12, 2 and Nehemiah 8, 10, what is meant by the phrase "the joy of the Lord"?
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.200]   How can we find this joy, and how can we apply this joy to our lives?
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   This is one of the most important questions that anyone can ask, because everyone wants to be happy
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.700]   and never lose their happiness in the miseries of hell, and therefore how to find joy and experience it
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.800]   to the full is what everybody cares about and ought to care about.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:55.600]   And if it's possible that we could actually share in the joy of God Almighty, nothing could be greater,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.200]   and nothing would be more stable and lasting. So this is important.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:12.700]   The reference to the joy of the Lord in Nehemiah 8 means at least the joy that the Lord Himself gives.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.800]   "Go your way, eat the fat, drink sweet wine, and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   for this day is holy to the Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength."
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.700]   And the joy referred to in Hebrews 2, 12 is clearly the very joy that Jesus Himself has today in heaven,
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.200]   which sustained Him through suffering. It says, "Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.500]   of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.200]   and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.700]   Now, what I assume that Nicholas is asking is something like this.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.200]   What is the fullest, deepest, most lasting kind of joy that a human being can have from God?
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.500]   And how can I get it? How can I find it?
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.200]   Now, those texts, those two that he mentioned, are pointers for sure.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.000]   But I'm going to go to another text where the answer is given even more clearly.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   Namely, I'm going to go to the Gospel of John, chapter 15, verse 11, where Jesus says,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:44.500]   Now, the reason this text is so important is that Jesus refers to His own joy as being in us.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   Not just giving us a joy, but His joy in whatever He's joyful in is in us.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000]   We're not just rejoicing over what we know about Jesus.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.500]   We're rejoicing with the very joy of Jesus over what He knows about everything,
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.000]   especially what He knows about His Father.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.500]   So let's make sure we hear it again. Let me say it again.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   This is Jesus. "I have given all these instructions to you," He says,
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.000]   "about what it means to be in the vine." That's what John 15 is about.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm the vine. You're the branches.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.500]   "I've given all these instructions to you so that you would enjoy my joy with me."
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   So that my joy would be in you as your joy.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   Now, this is incredible, almost.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   "My joy may be in you, and your joy may be full."
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   In other words, the reason your joy can now be as full as it is,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   and moving toward perfect fullness when all our battle with sin is over,
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   is because in union with me, the branch in the vine, you no longer enjoy merely your joy.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   You now have my joy in you, and you enjoy what I enjoy as your joy, as you abide in me.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   If you want to press further up and further into this mystery, which I think is a good idea,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   we can ask, "Is it not the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   the indwelling of the very person of the Trinity,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   who himself is the embodiment of the joy that the Father has in the Son,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   and the Son has in the Father?
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   Isn't this joy of Jesus in us the presence of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God?"
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   So when the Holy Spirit comes like a dove upon Jesus at his baptism,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   how does the Father put that into words?
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   He says, "This is my beloved Son, this Jesus, in whom I am well pleased."
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   In other words, God takes infinite pleasure in the excellencies of his Son,
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   and this pleasure is symbolized at his baptism by the coming of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   as a dove landing upon him.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   And listen to how Jesus prays for us at the end of John 17.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   "I made known to them your name, Father, and I will continue to make it known
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them."
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   In other words, the very love which the Father has for the Son,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   delights in, pleased by, cherishes, treasures the Son,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   that very joyful love will be in us so that we have the capacities
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   to love and enjoy the Son with the very love and joy of the Father.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Oh, for the day! Oh, for the day!
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   So in answer to Nicholas's question, I would say,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   pursue the experience of this joy by looking steadfastly at the whole array
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   of excellencies of Christ in the Word of God,
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   while crying out continually for the Spirit to come and open your eyes
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   to see this glory and to savor this glory with the very savoring of God.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   In answer to that prayer, God will give you significant measures
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   of the joy of the Lord in this life, and then at the end,
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   you will hear him say, "Enter into the joy of your Master,"
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   and it will be full and unmixed forever.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   Oh, amen. That's glorious. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   We talk a lot about joy on this podcast.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   What is true joy, and how do we find it and apply it to our lives?
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   And in the podcast archive, I see 50 episodes with the words
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   "joy" or "happy" in the titles alone.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   You can find all of them and about 850 other episodes right now in that archive.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   Scan those episodes really easily in the APJ app for Apple and Android devices,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   or go to our web home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   Well, can Satan devour Christians? 1 Peter 5:8 seems to imply that,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   yes, we can be devoured. Yikes.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   So what does that mean, and how can we be safe?
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   That's tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.500]   Thanks for listening to the podcast with longtime pastor and author John Piper.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   We'll see you tomorrow.
