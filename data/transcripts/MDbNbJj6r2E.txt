[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - We are back with pastor and author Ray Ortlund,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   filling in for John Piper,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.520]   who is on an extended writing leave right now,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.680]   working on his next book,
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.680]   which I hope to tell you more about soon.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.440]   Ray, in your Proverbs commentary, which is outstanding,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.680]   and I commend it to every listener,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.180]   in your Proverbs commentary, you write this, quote,
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.360]   "I have never seen adultery
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.620]   "send a whole church into meltdown.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.120]   "Gossip, by contrast, is often perceived as a little sin,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.180]   "but it destroys churches," end quote.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.840]   Those are strong words.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.520]   Explain the devastating power of gossip.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.960]   - Yes, well, the Bible says that life and death
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.780]   are in the power of the tongue.
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.120]   What an amazing thing.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660]   The old saying, "Sticks and stones may break my bones,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.640]   "but words will never harm me," that is not true.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360]   But how does that actually work?
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.560]   Life and death in the power of the tongue.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.780]   As I've thought about it, Tony,
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780]   it seems to me that we really experience reality
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.400]   within community.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.100]   We figure out, as we go through life,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.040]   we figure out who we are
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.000]   by the paying backs we get from other people.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080]   We go to the Bible for the big question,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   who's humanity?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.740]   But when it comes to the smaller question, who am I,
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.400]   within that humanity,
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   we have to notice how other people are responding to us
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.300]   and what they're saying to us,
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.120]   especially what they say to us about us.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.000]   And the impressions that we pick up from other people
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   by their words can be life-giving
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.440]   or that can be life-depleting.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.400]   So in our churches, when we say to one another,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.720]   especially when we say explicitly, "You don't matter,"
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.160]   and to the extent that you do matter,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.320]   you're poisonous and you're radioactive
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.560]   and you're a leprous and so forth,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   those words and suggestions and impressions kill the soul.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000]   Because even if we are able to have enough strength within
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.600]   to disagree with that assessment,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.040]   still we can't help but reel under those hammer blows.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.920]   So to be cautious and restrained and careful
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.720]   in what we say to one another is so important,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   but words can also be life-giving.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   We can, by grace, in obedience to the Bible,
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.200]   to the glory of God, breathe life into one another.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   Romans 12, 10 says, "Outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.520]   I mean, it's competitive.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.440]   This is a win-win competition.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.680]   So we have, for example, in our men's ministry
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.640]   on Tuesday nights, "Emmanuel Theology for Men,"
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   part of what we do is we take time
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.760]   for what we call honor time.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.120]   And it's not flattery, it's honest,
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.320]   but the scripture speaks of Christ in you,
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.160]   the hope of glory.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.880]   So we open it up and guys will say,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.080]   "Well, here's how I see Christ in you.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.240]   "Last Tuesday, when I faced this challenge,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.680]   "you stepped out of, at great inconvenience to yourself.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380]   "You helped me.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.120]   "I saw Christ in you and I honor you for that."
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.000]   And typically, Tony, when I throw that open,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.320]   immediately guys start speaking in it.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.280]   And it's hard to shut it down.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.480]   - Beautiful, thank you.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.080]   And really quick before we go,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.520]   flattery is a word we don't use a lot.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.200]   What is flattery?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   - Well, flattery is telling a lie.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.640]   Flattery is telling people something nice about them
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920]   that just isn't true.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.440]   But in a real Christian, Christ, the hope of glory,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.400]   lives in that person.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   And if that person is trusting him and walking with him,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.040]   the glory is not hard to read.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.120]   It's wonderfully obvious.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.080]   And we need to talk to each other about that.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.040]   Because of course, our enemy, Satan, is accusing us
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.360]   and telling us that we don't count
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.320]   and we're failures and so forth.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   So this is one way we fight back to joy in the Lord.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.120]   - Yes and amen, thank you.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760]   This is a glimpse into the kind of wise counsel
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.600]   you'll find in Ray's books.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.840]   Specifically his commentary on the book of Proverbs,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.000]   a book I featured in my top 10 favorite books of 2012.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.520]   It's titled, "Proverbs, Wisdom That Works."
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.240]   And it's published by Crossway, be sure to check it out.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.080]   Well, Easter is just days away.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   And I wanna finish out the week
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   with a series of three sermon clips
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.320]   from John Piper's best Easter sermons.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960]   Each clip focuses on the implications of Easter.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   And Pastor John will help remind us
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.680]   how Easter breaks our sin, how it breaks our heartbreak,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.480]   and how it breaks our mediocrity.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.840]   That begins tomorrow.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.400]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.560]   (silence)
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.720]   (silence)
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.880]   (silence)
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
