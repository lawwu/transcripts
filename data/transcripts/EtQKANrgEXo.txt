[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today's question is from an eight-year-old. Joshua comes to us via his mom, an avid listener
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   to the podcast. Here's Joshua's question.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.280]   Dear Pastor John, my mom likes to listen to your podcast when she folds the laundry. Thank
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.680]   you for filling her mind tank.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.560]   I have a question. Did you like to study when you were eight? I don't like math and I get
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.800]   angry when I do it. I don't know how not to, and I don't know how to trust God. Why do
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.720]   I trust God to do math? Mom tells me to do it for Him, but I don't like it and I don't
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   want to. The harder I try, the harder it gets, but I know it makes her happy.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.840]   Pastor John, what would you say to Joshua?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.840]   I want to talk directly to Joshua, so Mom, go get Joshua. Hello, Joshua. This is Pastor
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   John. Thank you so much for sending your question about math and how much you don't like it.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   I promise you that when I was eight years old, I did not like math either. In fact,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.760]   when I was in the third grade, I failed math in the first half of the school year. In those
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   days, teacher gave grades this way, "Unsatisfactory, satisfactory, very good, and excellent," instead
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.680]   of A, B, C, D. And I got the lowest grade possible, unsatisfactory, on my report card.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.640]   So I not only did not like it, I wasn't any good at it. And like you, I found it to be
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   very hard. But also, Joshua, like you, I had a mom, and she was a good mom, and she helped
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   me keep on trying until in the third grade, I was able just to pass the math course. So
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.840]   I'm going to try to encourage you, Joshua, not to give up, but to do the best you can,
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.740]   no matter how hard it is. And I have four encouragements to keep you going.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.000]   Number one, God made the world to be full of math. Now, you know, Joshua, that numbers
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.600]   are like words. You may not have thought about it. The word "dog" stands for a real animal,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.960]   and we call that real animal by the word "dog." But a real dog is not a word, right? It's
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   a real animal. So the word "dog" is just a name. It's just a name for something that's
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.680]   real. So words help us talk to each other about what's real. Without words, all we could
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   do is point. So words are really useful, even though they're just names. They're not real
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.760]   things, but they name real things. Now, that's the way it is with numbers, too, right? Numbers
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   are like words. They stand for real things or amounts of real things. For example, if
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.880]   you have two banana trees in your backyard, which we did when I was growing up, and on
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   one banana tree, there are four bananas, and on the other banana tree, there are four bananas.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.220]   And the next day at school, somebody asks you, "Joshua, how many bananas are growing
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.020]   on the trees in your backyard?" Well, you could say four on one tree and four on the
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   other tree. Or you might say eight bananas, because four plus four is eight bananas. That's
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.560]   math. But those numbers represent real bananas. They're not just numbers. They stand for real
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   things that you can eat and talk about. So God made a world of bananas and dogs and thousands
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.900]   and thousands of other real things that you can count. You can put numbers and names on
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.040]   them. That's the kind of world God made. So when we study math, we are trying to understand
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   the way God made the world. This is God's world, and He loves it when His people, including
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:43.060]   eight-year-olds, study His world and understand it and use it for His glory.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.100]   Which brings us now to the second encouragement. God made math very useful in this world. He
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.020]   made it to help us. Joshua, let me give you two stories, two illustrations. Suppose at
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.480]   the gas station where your parents fill up the gas tank of the car, you notice that they
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   have a special of three chocolate candy bars for one dollar. And you ask your mom, "Can
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:21.120]   I have a dollar, please, to get those candy bars?" And she says, "Sure. And here's two
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.880]   dollars. Get some for your friend." So you hand the man behind the cash register your
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   two dollars and ask for the candy bars. And suppose he hands you five candy bars and takes
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.120]   your two dollars. What are you going to say to him? If you studied math in the third grade
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   hard enough, like I tried to do, and you learned your multiplication tables, you would know
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   that if you get three candy bars for one dollar, you should get six candy bars for two dollars
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:05.000]   because you learned in the third grade that two times three equals six, not five. And
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.520]   if you didn't learn that, you'd walk out with five candy bars instead of six candy bars
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   because you didn't know your math. In other words, math is very useful for being happy.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   I'm just happy in this world because six candy bars makes me happier than five candy bars.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.200]   And the older you get, Joshua, the more important those numbers become.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   Or here's a more serious story. You are squirrel hunting in the woods with your rifle, and
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:48.440]   suddenly four vicious wolves appear in front of you. And they show their teeth. And you
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.440]   know you can't fight off four vicious wolves and save your life. You might be able to fight
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   off one wolf, but not four. So you quietly check your gun, and you notice that you have
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   only three bullets left in your gun. So you do the math that you learned in third grade.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   If I kill one wolf with each of my three bullets, then only one wolf will be left to fight because
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   four take away three equals one. And my life depends on this math. So you aim carefully,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   and you kill three wolves with each of your three bullets. And you know that you can't
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   kill three wolves. And when the fourth attacks, you're able to use your rifle and smash his
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   head in. Way to go. I promise you, Joshua, math will not only get you candy bars that
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   you should have. Math can save your life. It really can.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   Here's a third encouragement. God made your mom and dad with lots of wisdom about what
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   you need for your future life, wisdom that you don't yet have, because you're only eight.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   One of the reasons God gives kids parents is so that kids can learn about life from
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   their parents and avoid hundreds of mistakes. It sounds to me like you have good parents,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   Joshua. So did I. And they would not let me quit when I felt like quitting because they
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   knew what would be good for me. And I didn't know yet what would be good for me as I grew
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   up. I wanted to play outside with my trucks in the dirt with my friend, Sonny. That's
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   all I wanted to do. I didn't want to study. I didn't even want to go to school. I didn't
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   like school in the third grade. But I am so thankful to God that he gave me a mom and
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   a dad who knew what was best for me because I didn't know what was best for me myself.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   The Bible says, and you know it, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord." And I am so
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   glad it said that, and I'm so glad that I did it.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   Which brings me now, Joshua, to the last encouragement. God made you to show how good and how great
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   he is by trusting him to help you. And God made me, too. And guess what? He changed me.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   He changed me so that in the 10th grade, I loved geometry. That's a kind of math. Finally,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   there was a kind of math I really liked. It was like a detective story. You found the
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   clues, and you put the clues together and discovered the solution to the problem. It
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   was like finding out who the bad guy was and putting him in jail. But Joshua, to be honest,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   apart from geometry, I was mainly afraid of math. And when I finished my final required
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   basic math class in college, I felt like I had run out of a dark tunnel into broad daylight
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   for the rest of my life. Never, never, never have to take another course in math. Hooray!
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   I mean, it felt like a liberation, coming out of jail. So here's the point, Joshua.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   Even though you don't like math today, you might like it someday because you grow and
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   you change. Your brain changes. Or you might not grow to like math, and you'll be so glad
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   when you don't have to study math anymore. And that's okay. God made you the way you
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   are. You don't have to grow up to be a mathematician. But some math is good for everybody. I promise
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   you. So my final encouragement is when your mom and dad say that you need to finish your
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   math assignment, you should say, "Yes, ma'am," or "Yes, sir," and then whisper a prayer
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   to Jesus. "Jesus, please help me. I don't want to do this. I don't like to do this.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   But I am going to do it because my mom says to and Pastor John says it's good for me.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   So I trust you to help me." And Joshua, he will. And your trust in him will show how
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   great he is.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   Amen. Joshua, thank you for your question. We really appreciate you sending it in to
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   us. And mom of Joshua, thanks for passing it along. If your child has a hard question,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   send it to us. Send us that question or search our growing archive of answers or subscribe
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   to the podcast. Do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   Well, how do we argue like Calvinists? Theological controversy is to be expected. Paul tells us
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   how. And we are going to look closer at 2 Timothy 2:24-26 next time as we learn to argue
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   like good Calvinists. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
