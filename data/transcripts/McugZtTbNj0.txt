[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.840]   All right, we got a question here from Jonas.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.120]   Jonas asks, "How should one combine having young children and integrate newfound ambitions to one's life?
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.720]   Should both be balanced or approached in a seasonal way?"
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.840]   So he says, "Hi Cal, I'm a father of two young children, age one and three.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   Having them into my life made me realize some of the potential I had in me but left untapped.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.720]   I now want to realize it, but I find myself limited by my responsibilities as a father.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.120]   Should I still aim for big ambitions and find a way to balance both, or should I view the current times as seasonal
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.880]   and wait for them to grow up a bit before seriously getting after it?"
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.800]   Now Jonas, I would say some seasonality here is probably warranted.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:03.200]   When my kids were one and three, I would have been, it was a hard time just from an overhead admin
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.600]   just trying to make the work schedules work and it was not the easiest of times.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.760]   I was trying to get tenure at that time.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   This was this period I've alluded to before where I had really taken my foot off the gas pedal in my writing career.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   So Deep Work came out, I've got to get this timeline right.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.640]   So Deep Work, I finished writing Deep Work before my second was born.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.040]   I think maybe it came out, I'm trying to get the timeline just right here.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   I was working on it before he was born, but obviously it took me a long time to finish.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.680]   Because he was born in 2014, the book came out in 2016, but I finished it in 2015.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.680]   And then I kind of walked away.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   I do have memories of editing that book with a baby on my shoulder.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   And then I was like, "Okay, I need to take a break."
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   And it wasn't until years later that I got going again on Digital Minimalism and A World Without Emails.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.480]   So I remember taking my foot off the writing gas pedal.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   Deep Work came out in that period and ultimately did become a very successful book,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   but it was not a big deal when it came out.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.480]   I was not like I have to do today, doing publicity tours.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   I would do some podcast from our basement.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   And that was basically it.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   I wrote a couple of op-eds, but there was no big deal with that book coming out.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   It took up very little time.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   I did not write new books.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   I wasn't getting after it with Let's Get Going.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   When I saw that Deep Work had traction, I wasn't saying like, "Let's go.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480]   We got to get some new books out of here right away."
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   So I remember that as being a pretty slow period where all I wanted to do was focus on getting enough research done that I could get tenure.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   I just really remember that's what I was focused on.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   Then a couple of years later, I put my foot back on the gas pedal again.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.480]   I mean at some point, I remember having this conversation with my agent where I basically said, "I'm ready to work."
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   And that's when we turned around and wrote a proposal for digital minimalism and a world without email.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   I said, "Look, I'm going to write these beasts back to back. Let's roll."
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   As soon as I finished the first one, I'll go into the second one.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   And so I think seasonality matters with kids.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   Professional ambitions, let's go up and down.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   I think you're in a period now where you want a good steady state.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   It's also a great time to daydream and let me read and think.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   And these kids are going to open up, as you noted, they're going to open up a new understanding of your world and your potential and what's important to you.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   Tap into all of that daydream plan, figure out things you might do, read inspiring things, watch documentaries.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   But I would say wait to put the foot down on that gas pedal until maybe things are going to seem a little bit calmer.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   Finally, by the way, being a good dad to two young kids is a pretty ambitious thing to do.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.480]   So it's not like you're stripping ambition from your life.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   It's just you are focusing on a related ambitious project right now.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   It just doesn't happen to involve how you make money.
