[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   What do we got next?
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.240]   Next question is from Marathon Sprinter.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.300]   My company does a two week sprint
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300]   starting in the middle of the week Thursday.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960]   Should I switch my weekly plan to a two week long sprint?
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.040]   We plan probably. Yes.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.740]   So in my multiplayer, multi scale planning philosophy
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.860]   where you do quarterly semester plans, weekly plans and then daily plans.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.760]   The weekly has a little bit of give.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.100]   You know, it is important to have a scale of planning
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.140]   where you can see multiple days in a row.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300]   That's what allows you to figure out how to move these bigger chess pieces around.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.440]   That's what gives you the insight to move things, to open up bigger time.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.100]   That's what allows you to see, oh, early in the week, I need to really push on this
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.800]   because later in the week is worse.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.300]   You need some sort of planning scale that looks at multiple days at a time.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200]   If you go all the way to just say, what do I want to do today?
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.040]   You're missing some of this bigger structure to your available time
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.500]   and your available opportunities to get things done.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.200]   Exactly one week isn't so critical.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.000]   So if your company has a two week cycle, I think two weeks would be fine.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700]   Build it around the sprints.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.840]   In fact, you should probably put some specific structure
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.000]   into your weekly plans that take into account.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460]   This is sprint work.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.660]   And then this is the non sprint administrative work.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.940]   And I keep track of, OK, you know, these days I do the administrative work
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.900]   and then here's the sprint.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.460]   And you could even have like a special format built around it.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.200]   If you went much longer than two weeks, you're going to start to get into trouble.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.600]   I do know people who do monthly plans, monthly plans aren't that useful.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.840]   It's not enough time to do the big picture quarterly semester planning.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.040]   It's too much time to meaningfully like move around the appointments
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.600]   or think about when you're going to work is this too many days, two weeks fine.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160]   Three weeks iffy, one month too much, one week fine.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.100]   If you're doing just a couple of days at a time, not enough.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.700]   So let's get like a one to two week window.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.560]   That window of scales, I think.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.100]   I think that would all be fine.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.300]   But Jesse, you were telling me before the show, you had a
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.000]   a recent breakthrough in your weekly plans.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.560]   Yeah. So I think everything is iterative.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.060]   And the more you know, you're just talking about, you know, once you're a convert,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.260]   then you just hear the preaches.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.540]   So I hear you talk about weekly plans a lot.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.740]   And I was looking at mine and it was getting jumbled.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.260]   And there was a lot of stuff in there that should have been over in Trello,
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.640]   for instance, just because there were stuff
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.580]   that I wasn't actually going to get to that particular week.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.200]   So then when I went to the plant, I see all this stuff.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.700]   And I like for whatever.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.300]   You're talking like tasks related or objectives related to a bigger project.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.200]   Yeah. For like a certain job that I have.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.580]   And were you carrying these over?
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah. So you put a, you know,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.100]   here's the six things this project needs done on your weekly plan.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.280]   Yeah. And maybe just one of those gets done.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.440]   You just carry over.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.540]   Yeah. And rewrite or copy and paste.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.280]   As opposed to just sticking it over and Trello and then pulling it
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.980]   and then be like, oh, this week, I'm just going to do this.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.800]   And then because then that kind of gets along with the slow productivity
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.640]   stuff that you're doing.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.400]   And then you're actually making some progress on like a certain job
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.040]   or a task or whatever it is that you have in that plan.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.100]   Do you focus now each week on the I'm going to do one project or two projects
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.940]   like you hone in on exactly which projects are going to make progress on?
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.740]   Yeah, well, I have it divided into different jobs.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.580]   So then for like those whatever specific job, then it would be this one thing.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah, that I wanted to like make progress on, as opposed to like,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.080]   for instance, to say job a I didn't want to like
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.540]   I would have three things in there and then.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.700]   Wouldn't necessarily make great progress, but now like with one thing in there
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.280]   doing a few things, it's like the slow productivity mindset
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.540]   and like getting some stuff done.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.340]   And do you pull over?
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.700]   So you've identified a particular job you're working on this week.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.040]   Do you pull in from Trello?
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.000]   This is the one or two tasks I want to get done, or is it you're identifying
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.840]   this is a job I want to do as you work on it in the week.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.180]   Keep pulling stuff from Trello.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.140]   So what do you mean?
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.140]   I pulled in one in the beginning of the week.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.640]   And then if that gets done early, you might update the weekly plan.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.700]   Yeah, usually it's something that's going to take.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.980]   It hasn't gotten done early yet,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.700]   so usually it will take the whole week based on my other schedule.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.580]   So like a common experience people have, let's see if you had the same experience.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.740]   A common experience people have is let's say they have
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.800]   three or four major projects going on.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.680]   They're really worried about the idea of just working on one per week
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   because they think I can't look, I'm not going to get to this other project
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200]   for another three weeks like it's impossible.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.440]   I need to make progress.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   But what they realize if they do that, they end up getting things done
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.500]   just as quickly as if they instead tried to sort of quixotically
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.100]   do a little bit of every project every week that when you slow down
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.340]   and do one thing at a time, it doesn't actually necessarily slow down
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.180]   completion times for each of these projects on average.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.540]   And it tends to raise quality.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.300]   So was it was it stressful at first or a little anxiety producing to say,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.800]   let me just choose one thing, because when you're making that plan,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.840]   like I'm only putting one project on this and it feels
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.340]   was that anxiety producing at first?
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.080]   It was it reduced like anxiety, actually,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.500]   after I looked at the weekly plan and had less stuff on there,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.940]   I was like, oh, this is very doable.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.040]   Oh, interesting. Yeah.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.780]   So and you've had no problem getting these things done.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.640]   It's not like it's not like you were actually getting all these things
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.080]   done each week, you were just writing them down.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.500]   Yeah. And it was carrying over and it was like making my weekly plan jumbled.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.100]   Yeah. So that's good.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.580]   I like that. Clear and concise and better.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.900]   Be realistic in your weekly plan.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.140]   Yeah. Don't use your weekly plan to store things.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.240]   It's actually exactly store, store things elsewhere.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.040]   Weekly plans, what you actually want to get done
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.400]   and don't use it as a wish list.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.300]   Mm hmm. Because there is a little burst you get.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.600]   This is like the such a devilish little burst of pleasure you get
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.880]   when you're making a weekly plan.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.600]   If you put a bunch of stuff on it for 10 minutes,
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.460]   you get the little pleasure that comes from imagining, man,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.280]   if I got all of these things done this week, wouldn't that be great?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.260]   Yeah. And then you trade that like 10 minutes of like
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.520]   enjoying this fantasy you created for five days of stressfully
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.280]   coming nowhere near close to actually getting it done.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.780]   Yeah. So also so much planning.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.660]   I don't make it a wish list. Don't make it a wish list.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.360]   Yeah. The same with time block planning.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.820]   Early time block planners do this when they're planning their day.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.620]   They first they plan the day, you know, the perfect day.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.720]   It's if you'll excuse a nerdy reference.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   It's Harry Potter in Harry Potter
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.660]   and the Half-Blood Prince when he takes the Felix Felicius potion.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.920]   Jesse's looking at me like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.060]   It's a it's a potion that it gives you good luck.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.120]   Like everything goes just the best way possible when you take this potion.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.900]   So if you take this potion and I think time block planning for a lot of people
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.920]   and this is the type of like really cool, gritty analogy
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.880]   that gets us like a really cool fan base,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.520]   time block planning for a lot of people just becomes a productivity
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.960]   Felix Felicius potion where it's like, wouldn't this be great
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.920]   if this only took a half hour and then this 20 minutes between these two meetings?
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.420]   I took this off my plate and then this hour I finished that memo.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.660]   And you look at this plan, you're like, man, that would be awesome.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.060]   And like nine minutes into your day, your laptop's on fire.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.860]   The the company just went out of business.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.720]   You know, your child just gave lice to your pediatrician
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.860]   who's now left the left the industry altogether.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.460]   And, you know, seven new projects just fell on your plate.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.160]   And also you forgot you were supposed to be writing a book and it's due on Friday.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   Like it takes about nine minutes before this like miraculous plan you have
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.520]   where you're like, this is great.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.320]   Everything will take 20 minutes and of all this energy.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.420]   So be realistic. Don't make a wish list.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.720]   You'll feel better actually being able to get a reasonable plan done with time to spare.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.660]   In the end, it's going to make you feel much better
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.920]   than that 10 minutes of like, oh, this would be great.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.320]   [Music]
