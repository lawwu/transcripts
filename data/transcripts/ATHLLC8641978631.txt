[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.420]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.780]   about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.100]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.580]   Now, today is an exciting episode because I'm joined by the one and
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.220]   only Dan Pink, who is the author of several provocative bestselling
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.380]   books about business, work, creativity, and behavior, including the
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.460]   latest, The Power of Regret, How Looking Back Moves Us Forward, which
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.540]   comes out the same day this episode will.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.420]   His previous books, When, Drive, To Sell Is Human, and A Whole New
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.060]   Mind, were all New York Times bestsellers, collectively spending more
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.820]   than five years on the bestseller list.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.380]   They've won countless awards, sold millions of copies, and have been
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.740]   translated into 42 languages around the world.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.700]   And if that's not enough, his TED Talk on the Science of Motivation is one
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.900]   of the 10 most watched TED Talks of all time.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.300]   Today, we'll talk about how regret works, how it can help us make
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.580]   smarter decisions, perform better at work, and bring greater meaning to our lives.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.300]   We'll also dig into some of the best hacks he's learned about
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.980]   timing, motivation, and more.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.300]   Oh, and I saved the best for last.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.420]   Dan is actually a fellow All The Hacks listener, which makes
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.740]   this one even more special.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.980]   So I'm excited.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.980]   Let's jump in.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.500]   Dan, I've enjoyed your books for years.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.820]   Congrats on this one.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.900]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.140]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.500]   I have a whole bunch of questions about how to maximize my frequent flyer points.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300]   So if we can begin with that.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.180]   No, no, I'm a longtime listener, first time caller.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.980]   I do love the, I do love the travel stuff.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.620]   I also happen to be a Manu Ginobili fan and I couldn't believe you got him a
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.220]   couple of years or maybe about a year ago.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.660]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.940]   That episode was fun.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.260]   He doesn't do a lot of podcasts.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.500]   In fact, the one I had been able to find to try to get a sense of
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.900]   his style was all in Spanish.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.660]   So I had to find it on YouTube with subtitles to try to get a feel for his flow.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.540]   I remember when he won Manu Ginobili's thing.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.540]   So I'm a big basketball fan.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.540]   My, my, my son is a big basketball fan.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.380]   And, and when Manu was playing, my son would always say, because
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.900]   Manu's like lost a lot of his hair.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.860]   He looks as old as you, dad.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.180]   He looks as old as you.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.940]   Ooh, yeah, it hurts.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.500]   My daughter's just learning to speak.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380]   And I'm like, I'm faithfully worried about all these
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.420]   comments that I'm going to get.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.140]   Yeah, it's over.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.140]   You don't want to, don't, don't teach your kids to speak.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.940]   It'll just cause you trouble down the road.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.500]   So, uh, before we jump in, I got to ask, is there, do you have
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.980]   a favorite episode from the show?
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.980]   Well, I liked the Manu.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.180]   I liked the Manu and, but I have to say it like for me, it's the cumulative thing.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.820]   It's like, I've learned so much about, especially about travel and what
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.180]   to ask for and contacting general managers and reaching out in advance
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.780]   and all that kind of stuff, it's been super useful to me because travel is
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.780]   such a pain in the ass sometimes that if you can do small things to mitigate
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.620]   that, it really enriches the experience.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.780]   And the other thing that it does, I think in some level is it
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.980]   personalizes it a little bit.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.620]   It brings a little bit more humanity to it.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.780]   So it's not only the art of the deal, which I like getting the good deals,
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.100]   maximizing the points, but it's also some of the people you end up encountering
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380]   in trying to maximize your travels.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.540]   So thanks for, thanks for doing that.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.500]   I mean, I love it.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.220]   So expect more, but I read most of this book, you know, I've
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.020]   only had it a couple of days, but I'd like to just kick off for everyone listening.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.700]   I think regret is something we throw around a lot and people say, oh, no
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.380]   regrets and how would you actually explain to people listening what regret is?
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.420]   Great, great question.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.700]   So regret is an emotion and it's a negative emotion.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.260]   It feels terrible.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.100]   So it's that stomach churning sensation we have when we look
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.020]   back and say, ugh, if only I hadn't done that, if only I had done that,
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.660]   if only I had made a different choice.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.140]   And so it's actually an incredible capacity of our minds to be able
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.060]   to travel back and forth in time.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.180]   But ultimately it's an emotion that makes us feel bad.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.660]   That's why we try to avoid it, but it's also an emotion that is to my
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.820]   mind, the most instructive emotion that we have, but you said instructive.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.140]   I saw somewhere online, you talk about the surprising path to the
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.780]   good life when talking about regret.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.700]   So I got to ask, why does regret matter so much?
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.820]   Why can it be so powerful?
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.380]   Okay.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.020]   Well, I mean, so that's a whole kettle of fish there, but
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.100]   let me take it in two parts.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.220]   First of all, regret matters so much because everybody has regrets.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.500]   I mean, truly every person, every, essentially every
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.420]   functioning person has regrets.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.460]   The only people without regrets are five-year-olds who, because
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.100]   their brains haven't developed because it takes some cognitive firepower
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.300]   to even experience a process regret.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.740]   People with brain lesions, people with neurodegenerative diseases often
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.460]   can't experience regret and sociopaths.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.620]   The rest of us have regrets because it's part of the human condition.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.580]   It's an essential part of our cognitive machinery.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.140]   And the reason it's part of our cognitive machinery is because it's
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.460]   helpful if we deal with it right, that regret instructs, regret clarifies.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.900]   Now we have to approach it right.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.460]   We can blithely say, "Oh, I don't have any regrets.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.340]   I never look backward."
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.620]   That's stupid.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.260]   That's going to lead to delusion.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.620]   You can also say, "Oh my God, everything is, I regret everything.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.820]   I'm going to spin around and wallow in my regrets."
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.420]   That's an even worse idea.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.660]   What we have to do is recognize that regret is teaching us.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.780]   It's signaling to us.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.020]   And if we do that, I mean, I'm telling you, it is the most transformative
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.900]   emotion we have if we process it right.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.460]   I know I always regretted every financial investment decision I've made when it
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.460]   turned out that it was the poor decision, which is easy to do in hindsight.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.060]   And a really good friend of mine once always asked me, I was like, "Oh man,
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.100]   I sold this thing.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.980]   I should have held onto it."
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.580]   And he goes, "Well, with all the information you had when you did
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.220]   it, was it the right decision?
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.940]   Like if you had that information again today?"
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.580]   And I was like, "Well, I guess I would do it that way."
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.780]   And that kind of helped.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.340]   But I'm sure we'll get into a few more tactics.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.260]   Oh, sure, sure, sure.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.220]   There are all kinds of tactics.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.300]   And the other thing is, as you mentioned about the good life, is that, you know,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.580]   I went out for this book and I collected 16,000 regrets from
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.220]   people in 105 countries.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.780]   I mean, I have this massive database of regrets because I was curious
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.060]   about what do people regret?
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.500]   And I felt like in the existing research, there were some holes in that.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.900]   Or even in my own existence, I did another research project where I tried
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.460]   to figure that out and I hit a wall.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.700]   But I also collected these 16,000 regrets.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.540]   We're up to over 17,000 now from 105 countries.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.140]   It's nuts.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.260]   And what I found is that over and over again, people regret, around the world,
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.860]   regret the same four things.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.820]   And that's what gives us a hint about the good life.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.700]   That these four core regrets operate as kind of a photographic
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.860]   negative of the good life.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.980]   That is, we understand what people regret the most.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.020]   We actually understand what they value the most.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.980]   And so in this weird way, you asked at the top, Chris, what is this thing regret?
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.380]   And I said, it's an emotion that makes us feel bad.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.940]   But weirdly, this emotion that makes us feel bad contains the clues to what
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.140]   we ultimately want out of life.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.300]   And what were the four core regrets?
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   Well, so we've got let me not answer that question directly and give you
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.980]   a lengthy contextual buildup.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.540]   So one of the things that you see in the existing research on regret,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.700]   because I mean, developmental psychologists, other people in behavioral
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.700]   science have studied regret for many, many years.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.860]   Economists have studied regret.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.220]   Game theorists have studied regret.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.700]   One of the things that you see is that when they try to figure out what
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.100]   people regret, they sort those by the domain of life.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.660]   Let me give you a concrete example.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.380]   This will be easier.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.340]   So I have people who say my big regret is that I was in college
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.860]   and I didn't study abroad.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.460]   OK, not the most calamitous regret, but hundreds of those hundreds of those.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.260]   I actually think you could start a travel agency serving people who
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.780]   didn't study abroad in college and regret.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.980]   I'm dead serious about that.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.660]   There's a business in there somewhere.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.620]   OK, so that's an education regret.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.380]   Then I have people who say and this is an amazing one, and I have literally
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.740]   hundreds around the world that say blankety blank years ago, I met a man
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.100]   or a woman who I really liked.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.980]   I wanted to ask him or her out on a date, but I was too chicken to do that.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.220]   And I've always regretted it.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.580]   That's a romance regret.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.700]   Then we have, again, hundreds who say, oh, I stayed in this crappy job.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.580]   And if only I'd started a business, I always wanted to start a business,
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.740]   but I never got around to it.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.020]   I never had the guts to do it.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.460]   OK, that's a career regret.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.500]   But to my mind, those are all the same regret.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.540]   Deep down, those are all the same regret.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.780]   That's a regret that says, if only I'd taken the chance.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.980]   And that's one of the core regrets is the regret of boldness.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.260]   If only I'd taken the chance.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.460]   So there's a little bit of a head fake going on in that we're looking at the
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.220]   domains of life, career and education and health and whatnot.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.860]   And when what was going on was something actually much more important underneath.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.220]   So one regret is boldness regrets.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.460]   If only I'd taken the chance.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.220]   One big regret that people have are what I call foundation regrets, which is if
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.420]   only I'd done the work.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.860]   And these are people who regret smoking, who regret not exercising, taking care of
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.180]   their body, who regret not saving money, not working hard enough in school, small
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.820]   decisions early that accumulate to big consequences later on.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.700]   There are moral regrets.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.940]   And those are interesting because a lot of these regrets begin at a juncture.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.580]   You're at a juncture.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.300]   You can do the right thing.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.260]   You can do the wrong thing.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.500]   People do the wrong thing.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.540]   And a lot of them regret it.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.140]   So I got all kinds of people who regret bullying kids in school, marital
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.580]   infidelity, huge things like that.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.500]   And then finally, our connection regrets.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.420]   And those are regrets about relationships that were intact or should have been
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.260]   intact. They come apart.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.620]   Someone wants to reach out, but they say, oh, it's going to be really awkward to
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.500]   reach out. And the other side's not going to care.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.380]   So they drift even further apart.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.820]   And so connection regrets are if only I'd reached out.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.860]   And to me, what these tell us, 105 countries over and over again, what do we
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.620]   regret? We regret not doing the work.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.060]   We regret not taking a chance.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.980]   We regret not doing the right thing.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.740]   We regret not reaching out.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.860]   And that tells us what we want.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.260]   What do we want? We want some stability in our life.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.340]   We want a chance to do something to lead an interesting life and grow and have a
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.060]   psychologically rich existence.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.580]   Most of us, I'm convinced, want to do the right thing.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.140]   And we feel crappy when we don't.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.060]   And what do we want? We want connection and love with other people.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.740]   That's it.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.620]   And so my trying to understand this emotion of regret took me to this unexpected
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.020]   place where I said, wait a second, these people who are expressing their regrets are
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.660]   telling me what they want out of life.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.980]   And I think it's very clear now.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.260]   Do they all apply to everyone or is there some kind of formula to know who they're
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.140]   most important to by age or by anything else?
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.500]   Super interesting question.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.260]   So I also did a quantitative piece of research on a U.S.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.460]   population where we did a pretty good public opinion poll of 4,489 Americans to try to
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.740]   get at some demographic differences so we can do crosstabs to say, OK, do men have
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.060]   different regrets than women do?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.140]   Do African-Americans have different regrets from white people and so forth?
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.380]   And what we found is not that many demographic differences.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.900]   The big demographic difference comes out on age.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.100]   When people are young, let's say in their 20s, they have about the same number of
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.900]   regrets of action and inaction, same number of regrets about what they did and what
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.540]   they didn't do. But as people age, inaction regrets take over.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.780]   People have many more inaction regrets as they as they age.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.740]   Can you give some examples of inaction regrets that people older might have?
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.620]   If only I traveled more, if only I had reached out to my brother before he passed
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.340]   away, if only I had started a business, if only I had spoken up at work, those kinds
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.580]   of things. So fewer regrets about, oh, I did this.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.780]   And if we were regrets, I hurt somebody and I regret doing that.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.100]   More about I didn't do the thing that I always wanted to do.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.580]   I wasn't true to myself.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.180]   I didn't lead a life of meaning and significance.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.780]   Yeah, it's funny. I spoke with Ben Nimpton.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.980]   I don't know if you know him, who was in this show called The Buried Life and went
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.220]   on to write a bucket list journal.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.020]   And the whole thing was kind of inspired by the first of the five regrets of the
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.660]   dying, which is I didn't leave a life true to myself.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.620]   And so we talked a bit about that, but it was more in the spirit of kind of all the
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.500]   things you can put on your list to do.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.260]   So to kind of juxtapose that, I'm going to ask you now that you know all this, what
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.260]   advice do you have for people to use these regrets to kind of live the good life, if
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.660]   you will?
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.580]   I'll tell you one that changed me, Chris, and is on the connection regrets.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.700]   I don't want to get woo on you here.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.740]   You can, you know, at some level, when you work on a project, any kind of project, you
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.460]   know, if you're starting a business or doing a pod, like you're a different person
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.620]   when you started this podcast and you then you are on this episode, right?
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.860]   We change over time.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.580]   And so I'm a different person than when I started this book a few years ago.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   Now that I've spent all this time immersed in the research on regret and talking to
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.020]   hundreds of people about regret and reading thousands of regrets, I'm a different
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.380]   person. And the person I am today has a belief and essentially an unshakable belief
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.020]   now on this one dimension, which is this.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.780]   If you, if one, if I, you, anybody is at a juncture in your life and you're wondering,
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.900]   should I reach out?
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.500]   The fact that you made it to that juncture answers the question.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.780]   Always reach out.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.700]   If there is any single lesson for me in this research, it is always reach out.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.180]   I got all these people around the world who say, oh, I wanted to reach out to my
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.140]   friend or to this person who I used to know, but I thought it was going to be awkward.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.140]   So I didn't do it and they wouldn't care anyway.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.460]   And they're always wrong on that front.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.420]   It's much less awkward than we think.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.300]   And it's almost always well received.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:19.140]   So one, I don't even want to call it a hack as much as it is a habit of the heart,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.660]   which is always reach out.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.260]   If you're thinking about it, reach out.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.940]   Another thing, always go to funerals.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.860]   I mean it. I guess I have that regret myself.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.740]   A friend of mine, not a close friend, passed away several years ago.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.220]   I worked with him and he was a little older than I was.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.220]   And he had a funeral and it's embarrassing to me.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.220]   The funeral was literally, the service was literally walking distance from my house.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.060]   And on that particular day, I intended to go, but I got swept up in some deadline or
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.580]   something like that and I didn't go.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.500]   This was maybe 15 years ago and I still regret it.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.860]   So always go to the funeral, always reach out.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.580]   I think you have to think very hard if you're at a juncture where you can do the
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.860]   right thing or do the wrong thing.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.820]   I think you got to think very hard about whether you want to do the wrong thing,
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.140]   because I got people for whom doing the wrong thing is lingering in their souls for
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.740]   decades, for decades.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.980]   OK, so that that's kind of the moral and the connection.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.060]   Yeah. What about knowing how much you might regret not being bold?
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:28.820]   Is there something you can do to kind of fix the or prepare yourself for avoiding the
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.740]   regret of boldness?
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.380]   So one thing that you can do and we can talk more about how to take existing regrets and
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.900]   transform them because there's interesting practices to do.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.460]   So I'll give you in some ways the best decision making hack that I know of any kind,
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.300]   but it applies very forcefully to regret.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.540]   And it's this. What would you tell your best friend to do?
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.300]   Let's say you have a regret about boldness and you're at you're at another juncture.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.060]   You didn't leave a job to start a business.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.660]   Now you're in a new job. You don't like that job.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.700]   You want to start a business.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.900]   Your friend comes to you with that regret.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.420]   What would you tell him or her to do?
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:06.220]   And when you apply that, I'll see your hack and call it a heuristic, you know, a mental
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.940]   shortcut, right? When you apply that heuristic, what would you tell your best friend to do?
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.780]   People always know what to do.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.540]   So that's one thing that you can do to act on a boldness regret.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.260]   Now, is there a more systematic way to deal with and process your regrets that I think is
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:22.980]   useful to people?
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.980]   Yeah. So that's where I kind of wanted to go is some of these I can plan for these future
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.940]   regrets and what I might do if I'm thinking, oh, should I reach out?
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.140]   The answer is always yes.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.900]   But what about all the regrets we already have?
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.740]   I think there are three steps here in doing this.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.500]   So the first step is to reframe how you think about the regret and how you think about
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.380]   yourself. Now, once again, a lot of the way we deal with emotions is a form of
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.820]   triangulation. All right.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.460]   So in the same way that we don't want to ignore our regrets or wallow in them, we want
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.220]   to confront them. When we look at our regrets in ourselves, some of us are tempted to say,
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.980]   oh, I'm awesome anyway, boost our self-esteem.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.700]   Other people are tempted to lacerate themselves with self-criticism.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.540]   The better option is something called self-compassion, which is the brainchild of
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.940]   Kristen Neff, a psychologist at the University of Texas.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.180]   And what she has found is it's very simple and straightforward.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.500]   So when you have a regret, let's say that I have a regret about somebody bullied a kid in
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.260]   school and is really bothered by that even 20 years later.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.180]   What you can do is you can you sort of show yourself some.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.060]   So if a friend came to you with this regret, would you show them kindness or contempt?
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.860]   You probably would show them some kindness.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.340]   So show yourself that kind of kindness.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.620]   Do you think that this regret is part of the human condition or do you think you're the
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.020]   only one who's ever suffered from it?
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.140]   Believe me, you're not the only one.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.740]   All right. So let yourself off the hook a little bit.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.260]   And treating ourselves with self-compassion rather than self-criticism or
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.820]   self-esteem actually is the best way to avoid complacency.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.940]   Self-compassion. Number two, disclose it, man.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:00.500]   I mean, the research on disclosure is powerful that when we disclose our regrets, we
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.740]   should be talking about these things.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.220]   We shouldn't be bottling them up when we disclose our regrets.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.700]   We unburden them.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.660]   We lift the burden.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.500]   The other thing that we do, which is when we take these blobby emotion that we talked
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.020]   about at the top of the show, right, the regret is an emotion.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.860]   It feels bad, but it's kind of amorphous.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.140]   It's kind of it's a kind of abstract.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.140]   When we take that abstraction and convert it into words by talking about it, even
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.660]   writing about it, you take away some of the steam.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.380]   It makes it less fearsome.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.820]   So the act of converting it to language makes the regret less fearsome.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.420]   The other thing about self-disclosure is that we think that if we disclose our
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.660]   vulnerabilities, people will like us less.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.020]   Nope. There's 30 years of research that says they like us more.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.780]   Finally, extract a lesson from it.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.780]   So the way that you extract a lesson from it is you do some self-distancing.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   You say, if I'm looking back on this in 10 years, what do I want to have done?
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.020]   If someone else were in my position, what would they do?
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.940]   You can even do self-distancing through language.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.100]   So you, Chris, could say instead of saying to yourself, what should I do?
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.220]   Say, what should Chris do?
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.900]   Even changing to the third person.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.140]   And so you reframe it by treating yourself with self-compassion.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.700]   You disclose it and make it less fearsome by converting it into words.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.180]   And you extract a lesson from it.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.820]   And so if I regret bullying somebody, I say, you know what, I'm going to treat myself
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.180]   with some compassion that doesn't fully define me.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.300]   Two, I'm going to tell people about it because that's going to unburden it.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.180]   And I'm going to make sense of it by talking about it.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.660]   And three, I'm going to extract a lesson from it.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.100]   And the lesson is that I'm not a kid anymore.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.180]   But in my in my office, I'm certainly going to treat people with kindness.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:40.180]   If I see someone in my office bullying somebody in a way that adults bully, I'm
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.900]   going to stand up and say something and I'm going to transmit this knowledge to my
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.340]   kids about this experience and what they can learn from it.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.980]   Wow. But but again, I mean, I don't want to make it sound more more complicated than
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.140]   it really is, but it's really about sort of look inward, treat yourself with some
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.420]   kindness, express outward, disclose it, move forward, extract a lesson from it.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.660]   That's the way to do it.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.340]   And what you don't do is what you were saying earlier, where you say, I don't have
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.140]   any regrets, no regrets, no regrets.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.620]   I bully kids, but I don't have any regrets.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.620]   That's crazy.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.620]   Once you've done this, so this is kind of dealing with all of your past regrets.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.900]   Do you recommend just like sit down one day and kind of think about them and go
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.780]   through them or? I would start with one.
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.020]   I would start with one that's bugging you and everybody has one that's bugging them.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.620]   I know that because 17000 people have disclosed the one that's bugging them to
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.860]   me. OK, so pick one that's bugging from you and work that through inward.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.780]   Treat yourself with kindness outward, disclose and make sense of it forward.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.980]   Extract a lesson from it.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.100]   That's how you do it. You know, another thing that you can do in this in this
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.340]   process of reckoning with it is that there's certain kinds of events, certain
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.900]   kinds of regrets that we have that we can undo.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.580]   Like I got people in my in my book who have no regrets tattoos.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.940]   They have tattoos that say no regrets.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:59.220]   And then I have a guy who said who got a no regrets tattoo and regretted it and had
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.460]   it removed. OK, so that's how you that's how you undo a regret.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.100]   I'll give you another idea here.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.860]   So let's let's talk about career regrets.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.940]   Here is a hack.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.460]   One of my favorite hacks.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.060]   It comes from Tina Seelig at Stanford University.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.100]   It's called a failure resume.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.860]   This is one of the smartest things you can do as a professional.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.540]   So we all have these resumes, these glistening things that talk about how awesome
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.620]   we are and all of our accomplishments and credentials.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.260]   Tina Seelig at Stanford suggests that we also do a failure resume, which is the
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.740]   opposite of that, which is a list of all of our screw ups and failures and setbacks.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.300]   You list those.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   You don't have to tell anybody about it.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.980]   I've done this. I didn't tell anybody about it.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.020]   It's I mean, I told people that I did it.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.500]   I'm not showing anybody this thing because it's embarrassing as hell.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.660]   A list of your failures, setbacks and mistakes.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.460]   But you don't just leave it there.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.980]   Then you say, OK, what did I learn from this?
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.660]   And then what am I going to do?
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.540]   The failure resume is one of the best things that professionals can do.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.340]   And then just store it somewhere.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.540]   And do you come back and reflect on it on some particular cadence or how do you use it?
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.300]   Well, it depends. It depends because you can also like the way I did it, which is not
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.740]   exactly what Tina recommends.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.620]   But the way that I did it is list basically three columns, list the failure, setbacks,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:20.580]   screw up, whatever, list the lesson and then say next time I will blah, blah, blah.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.700]   For me, what happened, though, it was interesting.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.780]   And I think that the exercise itself is revealing, because for me, what I found is
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.300]   that, you know, some things that I did that didn't work out, that sort of flopped.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.780]   But it was like the stock that you mentioned.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.020]   It's like, yeah, I might do it again.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.460]   It's like I was I was out of my control.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.780]   It's actually not so much a failure as it is like life happens.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.660]   And sometimes things work out and sometimes they don't.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:46.540]   And that's OK. But on some of the things I found myself making when I looked at the list
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.380]   of lessons, I had two lessons that kept coming up over and over again.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   I was making the same two mistakes over and over and over again.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.940]   And they were in some ways the infection at the heart of some of these problems.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.820]   And I've done a good job subsequently of not making those mistakes again.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.020]   But the only reason I was able to really surface those two mistakes was by doing a failure
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.660]   resume. And is that something that helps you in the future?
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.260]   Or I know you have a kind of a framework for regret optimization.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.980]   And when you think about how to plan for a lot of people get worried about anticipating
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.740]   regret. Yeah. Is this a prereq to that framework?
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.300]   I don't think it's a it's a prerequisite.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.380]   I don't think it's a post-requisite.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.420]   I think it is it can live alongside.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   Again, I don't think that there is a single universal one size fits all prescription.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.140]   What I want to try to do is get people to rethink regret, normalize it, recognize that
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.220]   everybody has it and try to learn from the regrets.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.980]   Learn what people regret, because I think it points a path to a good life and have some
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.940]   tools and hacks and things that they can do to deal with a particular regret or two in
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.460]   their own life as a starting point.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.100]   So for some people, they care very deeply about their careers.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.940]   And so I totally recommend it for that.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.260]   Now we can talk about anticipated regret, which is a really, really interesting issue.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.260]   You know, we can talk about why Jeff Bezos was right and wrong to some extent.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.380]   We can also talk about, OK, so I'm into the hack thing now, Chris.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.060]   All right. Here's a hack. Yeah.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.780]   For all you kids out there stuck taking multiple choice tests, taking a multiple choice
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.340]   test. It's question 11.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.260]   You think the answer is A. You move along in the test.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.940]   Think, wait a second, maybe the answer to question 11 is C.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.500]   So here's the question. Should you change your answer?
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.460]   Should you change your answer?
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.820]   Now, if this it would be great if like we had this is like a call in podcast where people
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.340]   would call in and tell me. But if you I've done a poll on this asking this question,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.780]   overwhelmingly, people say, oh, no, no, you got to go with your first instinct.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.420]   And that's certainly what I was taught in the public schools of Columbus, Ohio, 100
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.260]   years ago. Always go with your first instinct.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.580]   Don't change your answer. Your first instinct is going to be more accurate than changing
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.740]   the answer. We have research on this and the research says that's wrong.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.540]   Change your freaking answer.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:09.540]   People are more likely to switch from a wrong answer to a right answer than a right
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.700]   answer to the wrong answer.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:18.340]   What hobbles them is anticipated regret gone awry because what happens is that they
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.660]   anticipate greater regret from the fear of switching from a right answer to a wrong
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.500]   answer than the fear of sticking with the wrong answer.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.380]   And so they don't make the optimal decision.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.340]   So a lot of times when we anticipate our regret, we actually end up making very risk
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.940]   averse choices. And so anticipated regret is not all good.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.060]   It's mostly good.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.420]   But there is a way to there's a way to reckon with the other thing about anticipated
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:51.420]   regret is that, as you were suggesting earlier, Chris, we need to pick what we're going
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:57.700]   to focus on. And so if you say, oh, am I going to regret buying a blue car or a gray
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.820]   car? Am I going to regret wearing my black sweater or my blue sweater?
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.180]   Am I going to regret having macaroni and cheese for dinner or turkey Tetrazzini?
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.860]   I mean, you can go crazy on this, on our decision making.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.980]   And I'm sure your listeners are familiar with this.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:18.340]   I mean, you'll see it in any social psychology textbook or class, the difference
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.780]   between maximizers and satisficers, people who are maximizers try to make the best
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.980]   decision on every single thing they do.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.500]   Satisficers say there's some things where good enough is good enough.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.820]   And what the research tells us very clearly is maximizers are miserable.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.940]   They're just miserable. And satisficers are happier.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:43.020]   And the key really is to satisfies on most things, but maximize on the things that
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.380]   matter the most. And that is, again, regret points is that way.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.780]   So you're anticipating your regrets.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.060]   You say, am I going to regret not doing the work?
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.100]   Yeah, you're going to regret not doing the work.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   Am I going to regret not taking the risk?
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.620]   Yep. You're going to regret that.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.140]   Am I going to regret not doing the right thing?
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.780]   Yep. Am I going to regret not reaching out?
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.180]   Yep. Am I going to regret buying a blue car?
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.020]   Probably not in a few years.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.660]   Am I going to regret taking a vacation to place A or place B?
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.620]   Probably not in a few years.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.780]   So what you have to do is you have to maximize on what's important in your
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.660]   anticipated regrets and satisfies on everything else.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.100]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.620]   I get it. Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.420]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.500]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.460]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.900]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.980]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.420]   It doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.180]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.700]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.980]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.580]   list,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.380]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.100]   leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.420]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine,
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.780]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:16.100]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.460]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:24.460]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.380]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.740]   Must be 21 plus not available in all locations.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.100]   When your projects get more complex,
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.780]   finding what you're looking for across your entire workspace gets so much
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.180]   harder. That's where Notion Q&A comes in.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.540]   It answers any question you have making use of your entire database of knowledge
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.100]   to make sure the answers are actually helpful. If you're not familiar,

[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.540]   I've used it to find information from old notes,
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.340]   answer questions about a marketing plan,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.220]   or even find my upcoming travel details all in seconds.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.100]   You can also ask Q&A questions in just plain English from anywhere in Notion.

[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.460]   I love the features Notion keeps shipping and it just reinforces our decision to
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.100]   use it as the central place we manage our life and work.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.580]   It also makes me even more excited to be partnering with them for this episode.

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.340]   What hacks might you have for someone who's in the middle of, uh,
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.100]   something they probably won't anticipate regret on, but stuck like, ah, you know,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.020]   I got these two hotels. I can't pick between them. They both look great.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.220]   Is it just, you know, it's easy to tell someone just do this one. And maybe,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.620]   maybe that's the question. Ask what your friend would tell them. You know,
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.380]   what would you tell your friend? Just pick one. Okay.
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.420]   So multiple hacks on that one, Chris. Okay.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.860]   So what would you tell your best friend to do? Okay. Here's my favorite one.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.540]   I don't know where I got this. Let's say you're trying to decide where to go.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.540]   So I'm going to go to, you know, uh, should I go to Croatia or should I go to
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.340]   Greece? All right. Let's say it's equally priced or whatever. Right.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.580]   So it's sort of in the same more or less kind of sort of region, kind of. Um,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.860]   but you just can't decide you're paralyzed by that. Okay. First of all,
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.180]   you're going to be fine because you get to go to either Croatia or Greece.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.860]   So you're going to be fine. All right. So you flip a coin,
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.620]   heads is Croatia and tails is Greece. All right.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.780]   You flip a coin when the coin gets to its apex,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.540]   you think, how do I want this to turn out in that instant?
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.620]   And that's your answer right there.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:56.540]   I thought you were going to go for what it landed on, but I'd like it. No, no,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.540]   no, no, no, no. Because the thing is, it's like, you sort of know you,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.140]   you actually, you know, you're,
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.260]   you're 50% in a peppercorn in one direction or another.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.540]   And that moment when it hits its apex is when you say it sort of is revealed to
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.980]   you. But this is my point. It's like, you're going to be fine.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.220]   You're going to go to Croatia and say, Croatia is awesome.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.700]   You're going to go to Greece and say, Greece is awesome.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.580]   The big thing there is like, gee, you know, should I take the risk of going to,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.260]   you know, it's like, should I go to Croatia? You know, I don't speak,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   I don't speak Serbo-Croatian and I'm not sure about some of the places to stay.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.180]   And I've never been to that part of the world before.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.660]   So maybe I should just play it safe and go to Hilton head or something like that.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.540]   You know? And there, there,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.500]   you will have a regret because that's a, that's about, that's about boldness.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.020]   And we have a lot of, I mean, it's interesting for your show, Chris,
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.220]   we have a lot of regrets about people not traveling,
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.060]   not taking the chance to travel to cool places.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.060]   Yeah. I've talked in the past about how easy it can be, right?
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.540]   You know, one credit card can take a family vacation.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.620]   My goal is to help people get, get rid of, you know,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.740]   if there's a thing holding you back, it certainly can't be the cost. You know,
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.820]   at least if you have good credit, I guess, free travel is available.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.340]   Absolutely. And, and,
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.700]   but the barrier for people isn't when they admit it,
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.940]   when they confess in this online confessional called the world regret survey,
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.940]   they very rarely, they don't say, Oh, I couldn't afford to go to Croatia.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.340]   And so I decided it's, it's not that it was,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.940]   it was like, Oh, you know,
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.700]   it was a little bit risky because I hadn't traveled abroad and,
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.340]   and I wasn't sure where to stay. And I really regret not taking that,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.420]   taking that risk.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.540]   I've heard a lot of people worried about going places because they say, Oh,
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.860]   you know, this place isn't safe. I don't know.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.180]   And I think I've mentioned this in the past, but someone was like, ah,
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.860]   I read this thing in this book and they said,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.540]   you got to bring the money belt and you got to hide all of your stuff.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.340]   It just seems so dangerous. I was like, go read the guide for New York city.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.620]   It says the same thing. And like, you know,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.660]   I don't put my phone and my wallet in a money belt walking around New York city.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.740]   And so, you know,
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.740]   everything's going to try to make you feel like it could be scary.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.100]   But at the end of the day, I think you're going to be fine in most places.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.020]   I mean, it's not, this is not a good thing,
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.380]   but I live in Washington DC and our neighborhood listserv three days ago,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.460]   talked about a carjacking. That's my neighborhood here in Washington DC.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.180]   So I'm telling you what people regret is not taking those kinds of trips.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.500]   Yeah. Did we hit on everything when it comes to anticipating regret?
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   So Jeff Bezos has this idea called the regret minimization principle.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.980]   And so his view is like every decision you make,
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.820]   you should try to minimize your future regrets.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.700]   And that comes from a famous story where I don't even know if it's true,
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.380]   but he's told it where he's working as a banker and he's thinking about starting
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.100]   Amazon and the guy, his boss says, ah, you're crazy. You don't want to do that.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.900]   And you need to think about it.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.380]   So he's taking a walk in central park and he's thinking about it and he says,
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.940]   well, what am I going to regret when I'm 80?
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.620]   Am I going to regret taking the chance or am I going to regret not taking the
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.780]   chance? And he says, I'll probably regret not taking the chance.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   So therefore I'm going to do that. Now that's sensible.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.660]   We can't minimize every single regret. We'll be, we'll become paralyzed here.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.500]   But when we look forward and again, ask these core questions,
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.100]   will I regret not doing the work? Will I regret not taking the chance?
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.140]   Will I regret not doing the right thing? Will I regret not reaching out?
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.180]   I think the answer,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.740]   at least in the chorus of 17,000 people who've told me is that, yeah,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.180]   those are the things you're going to regret.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.820]   So focus on making really good decisions there and just doing good enough for
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.660]   everything else.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.180]   Is it fair to say those are the,
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.140]   those are the maximizer focus areas and the rest you can kind of satisfy son?
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.300]   It's more than fair. It's essential to say that, that that's what you,
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.780]   you want to maximize on those things because those are the things that give our
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.100]   life meaning. And I mean that we talked a little bit about being a different
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.940]   person.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.900]   I am a different person having heard the voices of all these people for two
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.620]   years. They are all of them telling me what matters in their
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.100]   lives. And they're all telling me the same things.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.340]   And I look at what they're telling me and I'm like, yeah,
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:03.940]   what do I care about? I want stability for myself and for my family. Yeah.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.300]   I feel like I haven't taken enough risks in my life and I need to be bolder.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.180]   I feel terrible when I've in my life when I've done the wrong thing and it's
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:17.660]   stuck with me and I hate that feeling and connection. It's like, what, you know,
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.780]   ultimately what is life about except that do you have people in your life who
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.180]   care about you, whom, whom you care about? It's like, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.300]   There is an area,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.140]   a realm of our lives where we absolutely want to maximize and that's
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:35.180]   it. But other stuff just satisfies, you'll be fine.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.340]   So I'll share a minor regret. It's not, not one that's nagging me too much,
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.020]   but I've read a lot of your books and I feel like I would have loved to,
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.180]   had the chance to start this podcast, I don't know,
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.380]   15 years ago to be able to go through and,
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:51.300]   and have you on every couple of years and talk about them. But I can't go back.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.100]   I can't, I can't go back in time.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.780]   So I do want to see if I can pick your brain a little bit late on me. Yeah.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.980]   Yeah. There's a lot more with regret. And to that, I'll say the book's out,
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.060]   go pick it up and kind of dig into more of the research you've done.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.940]   But there's two of them drive and when that have some takeaways that I would
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.660]   love to chat about. And I'll start with drive,
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.980]   which was the first book of yours I read. And for those who aren't familiar,
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.420]   the subtitle is the surprising truth about what motivates us.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.740]   And so I think despite that I've read it though, it was years ago,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.420]   I think the first place to start is kind of, you know, maybe,
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.700]   maybe you could just share what is that surprising truth for,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.740]   for those that aren't familiar.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.780]   Yeah. I mean, it's that again, this is a book based on,
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.620]   on science based on the work of people like Edward DC and Richard Ryan and the
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.300]   late Mick me high chick sent me high and many other people who have researched
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.500]   motivation over the years.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.620]   And what it says is that human beings are complex.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.700]   We have one motivation and we have a biological drive. We,
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.780]   we eat when we're hungry, we drink when we're thirsty,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   we have sex to satisfy those desires.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.900]   We also respond very well to rewards and punishments in our environment in
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.620]   certain circumstances, but we also have another drive.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.660]   We do things because we like them because they're interesting because they're
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.940]   meaningful because it's the right thing to do.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.260]   I don't think that especially in organizations,
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.020]   we had a three dimensional view of people. So that's one big idea.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.340]   The other thing is that if you look at 60 years of research and motivational
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.420]   science, what it tells you is I'll give you the one quick conceptual takeaway
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.660]   here of that book, which is this,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.060]   there's a certain kind of motivator we use in organizations.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.620]   Psychologists call it a controlling contingent motivator.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.140]   I like to call it an if then reward as an, if you do this, then you get that.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.220]   If you do this, then you get that. I think it's a simpler way to understand it.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.300]   Here's what science tells us about. If not about all rewards,
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.340]   but about if then rewards,
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.260]   if then rewards are great for simple tasks with short time horizons,
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.460]   they work really well. We love rewards. They get us to focus.
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.820]   You say you want someone to stuff a lot of envelopes, pay them per envelope,
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.620]   give them a bonus for every hundred envelopes they stuff for simple tasks where
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.420]   you know exactly what you need to do. And you can see the finish line.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.020]   If then rewards are effective because human beings love rewards,
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:02.340]   but the same body of research tells us that if then rewards are far less
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.900]   effective for more complex tasks with longer time horizons. Why?
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.620]   It's the same reason we love rewards so much. They get us to focus very narrowly.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.540]   That's a good frame of mind if the task is algorithmic,
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.580]   but if the task requires judgment, creativity, discernment,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.900]   you don't want to have that narrow focus. You want to have an expansive focus.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.780]   And the problem in organizations is that we're using if then rewards for
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.100]   everything rather than for the,
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.940]   the small and increasingly smaller kind of work that,
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.780]   that people do. And there is a better motivational regime. You want,
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.540]   you want to give people some autonomy.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.100]   You want to help them make progress and get better at something that matters.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.940]   You want to plug them into a purpose.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.220]   Yeah. So you touched on that briefly.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.140]   Then I remember that the kind of three elements are autonomy, mastery,
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.260]   and purpose, right? Are those things you can create for your own?
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.580]   Or are they things that organization has to give you?
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.820]   Well, I mean, that's a, that's a very profound question, actually. I mean,
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   seriously, I mean that because I think part of the whole field of
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.540]   behavioral science is basically the entire field of social psychology at the
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.100]   very least.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.940]   But I think the entire field of behavioral science is when we look at people
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.060]   acting in whatever realm of life,
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.260]   how much of what they're doing is because of the person and how much is it of it
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.220]   because of the situation, you know, it's both obviously.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.420]   So certain people in certain situations will behave differently from other
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.180]   people in certain situations. So I think that for these kinds of principles,
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.140]   you want to work,
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.900]   you want to go to a place and environment that has the nutrients in the
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.060]   soil for these things. It's not so much sort of giving you it.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.220]   It's basically creating an atmosphere where those kinds of things can,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.980]   can flourish. Let's take autonomy. For instance,
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.620]   we want to give people some sovereignty over what they do and how they do it
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.980]   and who they do it with.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.420]   There's some places that just where that soil is not rich enough,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.260]   where no matter how autonomous you might be as an individual,
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:04.020]   it's you're not going to be able to drop roots in a soil where the whole
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.060]   enterprise is about thwarting autonomy and controlling people.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.820]   So I guess this is a long-winded way, Chris, of my answering that question.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.740]   It depends.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.340]   So let me rephrase it a different way.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.980]   If you're finding yourself not very motivated to do something,
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.140]   is it safe to say that the first place to start to figure out how,
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.020]   how to maybe figure out whether you can be motivated,
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.180]   because maybe you just are in a place where it's not possible is to kind of dig
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.460]   in and explore those three elements and try to figure out if any of them are
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.900]   missing and how to create them.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.940]   Yeah, I think that's a very, very good idea. So the question is, so ask yourself,
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.460]   do, do I have control? How much control do I have over what I do,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.820]   how I do it, when I do it, who I do it with.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.220]   If you come to that conclusion and say, you know what,
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.500]   I don't have much control over any of those things.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.180]   That often is a very early warning sign of a, why you're demotivated. Now,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.740]   let me give you another one. Cause I can, I can deliver a hack here.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.900]   One of my favorite ones of practice of my own.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.140]   When we think about mastery, the second element,
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.820]   mastery is our desire to get better at stuff. And at some level,
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.620]   it's also about our desire to make progress.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.460]   Teresa Mobula at Harvard business school has some brilliant research showing
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.340]   that the single biggest day-to-day motivator on the job is making progress in
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.540]   meaningful work. But here's the thing.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.140]   We need information and feedback to know whether we're making progress.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.340]   That's true for anything, right? So if you're driving somewhere,
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.020]   you need to know how fast you're going. You need to have, you know,
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.940]   the directions and the road signs and the GPS and whatnot.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.100]   And for many people, especially in the workplace,
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.700]   they're in a world devoid of information about how they're
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.260]   doing. So now to the hack, one of my favorite things,
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.740]   and I have this on my, on my laptop,
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.260]   on which I'm talking to you is it was what I call a progress ritual,
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.460]   a progress ritual. At the end of every day,
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.900]   I stop and list what I got done that day.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.020]   It takes me 60 seconds,
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.300]   but I don't leave my office without doing that because it
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.500]   helps me see the progress that I'm making.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.100]   And we know from the research that making progress is the single largest
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.260]   day-to-day motivator.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.100]   So I have a giant list that just says basically a
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.700]   got done list, a progress list. I call it a got done list,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.900]   but it's really a progress list.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.260]   And so what I'll do is on the day that I'm talking to you,
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.340]   I will go to that list and I will type in everything that I got done today.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.900]   And all of us know at some level,
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.580]   how intuitively appealing this is because many of us have done the thing
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.900]   where we have a to-do list, write it all out or type it all out.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:44.100]   Then we do something that's not on the to-do list and we write it on the to-do
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.020]   list and cross it out because we know how satisfying that is.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.900]   And so this progress ritual,
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.780]   60 second punctuation mark at the end of every day to me is one of the most
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.540]   important things that you can do to maintain your daily motivation.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.260]   And just to get super tactical, where do you put that list?
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.860]   I keep it literally on a word file. I don't, I never go back to it.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.060]   That's the thing that's interesting about it. It's not,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.660]   it's not for capture to review things.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.140]   It's for the moment it's for that punctuation mark,
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.780]   the ritual in that moment.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.340]   And what I've found is that on some of the most frustrating days that I have,
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.700]   if I take that punctuation mark for 60 seconds, I realized I've actually,
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.900]   I've actually made some progress that day that buoys my motivation and it allows
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.900]   me to come back the next day. But I very almost never look back on it.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.340]   It's the ritual itself that is powerful.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.660]   I love that. I've even applied something similar to my life,
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.940]   which is I need to make sure I do something exciting and memorable every month
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.540]   to just kind of keep up the progress of non-professional things.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.140]   I think it's so easy to spend your days with making all the progress in life on
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.420]   work and forgetting that there's all of these other elements in life that you
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.780]   probably want to make progress on. But for some reason, for many of us,
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.740]   work is the one we focus on all the time.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.220]   But it's a great point, Chris, because on my list, I put non-work things.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.340]   I'll put, you know, ran four miles. I'll put a,
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.540]   had a phone call with my daughter. You know,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.380]   I will put those kinds of things on there because that's a very important part
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.020]   of making progress. It's not only, it's not only the work stuff.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.260]   And how long is the list? Usually it's a couple of things,
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.780]   or do you try to get pretty granular? It could be 10, 15, 20 things.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.580]   It depends on the day, you know, like there's not,
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.860]   sometimes a long list is less,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.860]   is there's less progress because I'm doing a bunch of different small things.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.420]   Other days, if I say I wrote a thousand good words,
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.780]   that's our fricking awesome day.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.460]   Even if that's the only line item on there, you know, so it, it, it really,
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.780]   it really varies. But again, the, the key thing here,
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.420]   and I really want to emphasize is that it is the act itself that is valuable.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.220]   Simply doing it is important.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.420]   You can always have it be an ephemeral list and get it was written in invisible
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.020]   ink or like it self-destructed after seven days. Or if somebody,
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.820]   you know, if somehow Dropbox had some kind of calamity and it disappeared,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.780]   I would be fine.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.940]   Yeah. There's a lot of stuff I wouldn't be fine about.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.140]   If all the Dropbox files disappear, that's what I'm saying. Cause I have,
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.740]   if Dropbox goes down my life, it's over for me. I mean, I might as,
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.900]   I basically, if Dropbox goes down,
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.460]   I just go into a monastery for the rest of my life.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:21.780]   Any other motivation hacks to get on? We can go to general stuff at the end,
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.260]   but just before we move on.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:23.900]   I mean,
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.340]   one of the things that I like to do for motivating yourself and also for
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.940]   motivating other people is each week I try to have two fewer
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.180]   conversations about how, and two more about why,
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:40.300]   particularly when I'm working with other people and have even a minor directive
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.460]   role, you know, it's like,
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.300]   here's all I want you to do that piece of the website.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.660]   Here's how I want us to do that presentation. And just twice a week,
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.500]   you realize when you're working with people and you're in any kind of
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.100]   instructive mode, you have more how conversations than you realize.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.300]   And what I have found is that just converting two of them a week to a why
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.780]   conversation is important. So catch yourself say, okay, here's how stop.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.220]   Here's why we're making that presentation.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.620]   And I find it useful pointed inward as well, especially as a writer.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.260]   So there are times when I will,
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.860]   if I'm struggling to write a chapter or struggling to write anything,
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.180]   I naturally want to say, okay, how can I finish this chapter?
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.340]   How can I get this section done?
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.300]   And then it's helpful for me to stop back and say, okay,
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.060]   why am I writing this section? Why am I writing this chapter?
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.540]   This is not just a couple of times. And just both internally and externally,
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.180]   we're a little over-indexed on how conversations,
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.500]   and we're a little under-indexed on why conversations.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.340]   And there's a pile of evidence showing that why that sense of purpose is,
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.540]   is I think it's the most cost-effective performance enhancer we have.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.780]   Wow. That's a great hack.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.500]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.380]   when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.860]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.100]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit,
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.620]   I was a skeptic at first,
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.300]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from Anyday,
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.060]   I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.420]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.980]   scratch in the microwave. And honestly,
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:24.300]   using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.660]   process so much.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:30.220]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store,
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:34.900]   and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer,
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.140]   and oven safe too.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.620]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure,
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.860]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice. It is so good.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.620]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched last
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:53.620]   year, you have to check it out. So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.740]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.300]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.380]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.860]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.100]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:31.540]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.380]   for coffee. There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade.

[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:43.620]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.660]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade,
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.820]   but this last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.780]   it's called bark the moon and it's so delicious.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.900]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription. Right now,
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.340]   trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.

[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.660]   So please consider supporting those who support us. Okay.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.860]   I said I wanted to hit two books, so I'm going to move on to when,
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.140]   get some timing, try to make sure we have room for it.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.900]   Which for anyone who hasn't read or seen it's the scientific secrets of perfect
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.060]   timing. And I know we've all heard timing is everything, right?
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.980]   I bet that's a common phrase and a lot of us think timing's up to serendipity,
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.780]   but my takeaway was it's definitely not something that you should leave to
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.340]   serendipity or let coincidence run. Is that a fair takeaway?
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.300]   That is once again, Chris, your concern about fairness is admirable,
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.420]   but it's an essential takeaway.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:07.420]   The essentialness comes from the fact that timing is not an art, it's a science.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.300]   And for that book written a few years ago, I went back and looked at, I mean,
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.740]   we looked at like, I don't know, 700,
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.100]   800 studies across a whole array of different fields about timing.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.740]   And what it,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.260]   and what it shows is that our brain power changes over the course of a day.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.620]   So we perform differently on different kinds of tasks based on the time of day.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:30.620]   It shows that we have, I think, very seriously undervalued taking breaks.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.980]   And even the way we think about breaks is distorted,
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.860]   but it also shows even on episodic timing that, you know,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.220]   how to beginnings affect us, how to midpoints affect us,
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.700]   how to endings affect us, how to group synchronize in time.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.460]   So a lot of really,
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.260]   really interesting stuff that makes us more aware of
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.980]   the temporal aspects of our lives. And once we're more aware,
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.300]   we can be more intentional.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.740]   We tend to be very intentional about what we do, who we do it with,
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.460]   but we're less intentional about when we do things.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.980]   And there's a pile of evidence showing that when we do things has a material
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.820]   effect on our performance and our happiness.
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.980]   I don't want to go through the whole book because that there,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.940]   that take a lot of time and there's a book for people to read.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.700]   But if we went one layer, one layer deeper there,
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.900]   like when should people do things or, or,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   or does it matter depending on the type of person?
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.820]   Let's talk about that. Um, well, it does matter depending on type of person.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.420]   So let's just talk about daily timing. Okay.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.740]   And the day is a pretty fundamental unit of time because we can't do anything
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.420]   about it. You know, we're on a planet, the planet's turning like, you know,
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.380]   we could say like a week is not a real thing.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.940]   We could just declare a week as nine days. A week is a human invention.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.180]   We could have say a week is 13. I hereby declare as president of the world,
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.940]   a week is 13 days. Fine. You just can't declare, Oh,
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.580]   a day is only going to be 14 hours. Nope, not going to work.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.180]   So daily timing is really important. Here's what we know.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.060]   The most important thing is that our cognitive abilities change over the course
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.580]   of the day. They are not static.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.900]   And this is the big mistake that we, that we often make.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.940]   We think that all times of the day are created equal. They're not.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.300]   Our brain power changes over the course of the day.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.220]   It changes in material ways and the best time to do something depends on what
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   you're doing. So this can't quite get to the level of like particular
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.900]   hack, but it can get to the level of design principles.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:21.100]   And I think that a lot of the actual particular hacks in this realm are wrong.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.460]   They're not scientific. So here's what we know.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:27.380]   You have to begin with what's called a chronotype and that is essentially your
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.700]   propensity. Do you wake up early and go to sleep early?
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.580]   Do you wake up late and go to sleep late? Are you somewhere in between?
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.740]   And what the distribution tells us is that about 15% of us are very strong
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.460]   morning people. 20% of us are very strong evening people, night owls,
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.220]   and about two thirds of us are in the middle,
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.340]   but we tilt a little bit more toward the morning.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.660]   An overly simplified way of thinking about this is you have night owls and
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.020]   everybody else. 20% of us are night owls.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.100]   We naturally wake up late and go to sleep late.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:58.580]   80% of us are a little bit more the other way.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.300]   And what it shows us is that we, the research tells us,
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.580]   we move through the day in three stages. There's a peak, there's a trough,
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:10.700]   there's a recovery. The peak for most of us, 80% of us is early in the day.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.620]   That's when we're most vigilant. We're able to bat away distractions.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.380]   So that's when we should be doing our heads down analytic work.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:22.180]   The trough early to mid afternoon, that is a terrible time of day.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.580]   We joke about it, but the data are overwhelming.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.140]   Like don't go to the hospital in the afternoon.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   They're more per capita car accidents between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM than at any
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.780]   time, except for the mid, except for between 4:00 AM and 6:00 PM. I mean,
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.340]   there's a downdraft in performance in that early to mid afternoon that is
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.820]   staggering. So we all have that, that trough.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.540]   We should be doing our administrative work in that period.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.980]   The work that doesn't require a massive cognitive load. Now, the final stage,
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.420]   peak early trough in the middle recovery later in the day,
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.620]   in the recovery phase of the day, it's very interesting.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.580]   Our vigilance or mental vigilance is down, but our mood is typically up.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:07.420]   And that can be a very potent combination for doing things like brainstorming or
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:10.780]   solving non-obvious problems or iterating ideas.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.580]   And so for 80% of us,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.900]   we should be doing our heads down analytic work during the peak,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.980]   which is most usually early in the day.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.060]   We should be doing the least important stuff for those couple of hours in the
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.260]   middle of the day. And then we should be doing our insight, iterative,
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.780]   brainstorming kind of stuff later in the day. Now,
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.700]   the one caveat here is that if you're part of the 20% who are night owls,
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.380]   you're much better off doing your analytic work late in the day,
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.300]   because that's when you are most vigilant.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.700]   And so one of the things that we see is that the traditional corporate
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.660]   structures are completely inhospitable to people who are night owls.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.660]   They want people to be at like 7 a.m. staff or 8 a.m. staff meetings when
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.260]   these people are barely conscious at that time,
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:59.180]   but they're on fire at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.580]   Do you think the trend towards kind of remote work and multiple time zones kind
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:05.420]   of makes it better for these night owls?
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.100]   Yeah, I do. I think it's,
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.740]   I think that remote work is a godsend to night owls, not only remote,
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.540]   but also again, autonomous work, going back to drive for a second,
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.740]   autonomous work is great because you want to give people some amount of control
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.660]   over what they do, how they do it, but also when they do it.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:26.380]   And so at some level we should be managers should be,
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.220]   should be focused on results,
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.700]   not on whether Chris is at his zoom on the zoom meeting at
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:37.020]   830 in the morning when Chris is doing high quality work and he's,
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:41.340]   and he's more comfortable doing it between 9 p.m. and two in the morning.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.740]   I don't care if he's not on that 830 zoom call, cause he's delivering,
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:45.780]   he's delivering results.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.060]   And what I want to do as a manager is default to autonomy,
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.020]   to let people find the way of work that is best for them.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.900]   And that contributes to the larger whole.
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:57.220]   Now I know about,
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.060]   you said 80% of people should be doing that analytical work in the morning.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.060]   And if I remember right, one of the takeaways was that you hate breakfast.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.020]   Is that, no, no, I don't hate breakfast. I don't hate breakfast. No,
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.820]   I don't hate breakfast at all. It's like, like, you know,
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.340]   I sort of see things a little bit like an economist as like pricing.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.060]   And so I think that breakfast is over the evidence that breakfast is the most
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:20.300]   important meal of the day is almost non-existent. I mean, breakfast isn't bad.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.900]   I eat breakfast. It's not bad.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.620]   The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is,
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.260]   is really a legacy of breakfast,
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.220]   cereal advertising from the early part of the 20th century, truly. But,
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.380]   but I actually think that in some ways breakfast is overvalued and lunch is
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.780]   undervalued lunch as a punctuation mark in the middle of the day lunch as a
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.940]   break in the middle of the day, I think is undervalued.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.460]   And I think that breaks in general are undervalued.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:51.300]   We have this even the many of us who have zero connection to the family
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.780]   connection to the Puritans have absorbed this very puritanical view
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.300]   that the way to get work done, more work done,
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.020]   better work done is to power through all the time.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   And also this idea that powering through is morally virtuous.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.500]   That's not what the evidence tells us about high performers.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.740]   The evidence on high performers in music and sports in so many realms shows that
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.540]   they are systematic break takers.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:19.100]   They treat their breaks very seriously and so should the rest of us.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:23.340]   Is there a kind of general principle or a hack for here's how many breaks you
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:26.020]   should be taking or how often, or, you know, what types?
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.420]   So here's the thing, like, like, like we're going to follow the science.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.340]   We have design principles. We can, this is, this is why I go crazy.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:35.340]   Where the advice is like, wake up at four 30 in the morning and win the day.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:38.580]   You know what? A lot of us don't do that. A lot of us, we're not,
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:42.260]   our brains and physiology are not built for that. I'm sorry.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.940]   I don't think that there is a certain number of breaks to take in the day.
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.780]   However,
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:52.700]   there are design principles very clearly rooted in the science about the
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.300]   kinds of breaks that you should take.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.780]   So one principle is that something is better than nothing.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.620]   So even a short break is better than no break at all.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.700]   Two outside is better than inside. I think, again,
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.900]   one of the things that we haven't fully reckoned with is the importance of being
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.220]   exposed to nature and being in nature, even in urban environments.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.460]   There's a whole pile of research on this as well.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.380]   So outside is better than inside moving is better than stationary.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.340]   A break where you're in motion is better than a break where you're sedentary.
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.580]   Social is better than solo.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:28.020]   So breaks with other people are more restorative than breaks on our own,
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:31.580]   even for introverts. And finally, last and certainly not least,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.260]   you got to be fully detached.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.980]   So a break where you're walking around with your face in your phone is not a
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:40.220]   break. You got to be fully, fully detached. So I've always thought that, you know,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.540]   you want to sort of a meta change the country and
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:49.340]   increase labor productivity by 0.6% in a year hack,
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:54.180]   which would be an incredible accomplishment is that if everybody in a minute,
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:58.780]   in the American workforce took a 15 minute walk every afternoon,
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.300]   took a 15 minute walk outside with someone they liked talking about something
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.140]   other than work and leaving their phones behind.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.260]   I think that would be how we are at a market increase in productivity and also
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.020]   mental and emotional wellbeing.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.540]   Well, I can't change the entire country that, I mean,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.860]   talk about something an easy hack, right? It costs nothing.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.940]   Totally. And adds a lot of value.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.300]   And the hack would be since you're not,
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:24.740]   since most of the people who listen to a podcast about hacks are not going to do
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:28.700]   it sort of impulsively. Just put it in your schedule,
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:32.180]   set it for a week, you know, to 15, every afternoon,
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:36.380]   I'm going to take a 15 minute walk break with someone I like outside talking
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.820]   about something other than work and not bringing my phone with me.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.380]   And I actually think Chris, that if in organizations, if managers,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:44.780]   if the leaders of these organizations start doing this, then that,
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.620]   that actually could be a game changer.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.780]   I mean, could everyone just do it at the same time? Would it be like as like the
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.180]   bell, you know, rings the production line stops?
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.700]   Well, well, you're making a very interesting point there, right? Because if I,
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.940]   if you think about these design elements, outside, in motion,
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:04.780]   detached with people you like, that's basically recess. So, you know,
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.460]   I have long advocated that we should have, you know, maybe we do it en masse.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.620]   We have a 2.30 every day. We have the great American walk break.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.300]   Or we just call it recess and bring back the childhood spirits?
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.780]   We can call it the great American,
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.540]   we can call it the American adult recess initiative.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.460]   Ari, no, that doesn't quite work there. The adult recess initiative, Ari, Ari.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:29.220]   No. Yeah. We can work on it. Yeah. So this is all for the day, right?
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.340]   You talked a little bit about how to schedule this for the week.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.580]   Did you learn anything about timing? You know, I know you said weeks, months,
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.940]   years, they're all kinds of concepts that we made up,
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:41.100]   but is there something important to good timing over longer periods of time?
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.540]   Well, yes and no. I mean, I think to me, the most,
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.940]   the most important piece of research there is by Katie Milkman,
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:51.140]   Jason Reese and Hengchen Dai who did something where they discovered what they
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.460]   call the fresh start effect,
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:57.500]   which is that certain days in the calendar operate as
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.700]   temporal landmarks. That is, they, they stick out in the calendar.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:06.260]   They stick out in time the way that physical landmarks stick out in space and
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.780]   they give us a way to orient ourselves.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.380]   And there's certain kinds of temporal landmarks that are these,
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:16.060]   that they call these fresh start dates that where we essentially relegate our
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:20.980]   past, our bad selves to the past and open up kind of a fresh ledger
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.180]   on our new selves. So they found, for instance, that in college, okay,
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.860]   so they had, they look at a large university,
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.540]   a large university where students are swiping in and out of the gym.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.060]   When are students going to the gym?
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.820]   So it's a brilliant study because you can,
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.780]   you can get data on students taking their ID, swiping into the gym and not.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.620]   Students more likely to go to the gym on the first day of the semester,
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.740]   on Mondays, on the day after a holiday.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.420]   And so there's certain days of the year where we are more likely to begin
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:55.460]   behavior change and therefore more likely to continue with that behavior change.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.020]   And those are the fresh start dates. First of the month, beginning of a semester,
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.500]   first day of a quarter, the day after a federal holiday, that kind of stuff.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.060]   What about making big decisions? I'm going to switch my career, quit my job,
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.460]   or, you know, something like that. Any science to timing those?
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.940]   You know, those big decisions accumulate.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.900]   And so it's not the kind of thing where people decide, you know,
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.020]   right away in terms of a given day,
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.580]   there is some evidence showing that we are more likely to resort
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.180]   to a kind of default, no,
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.060]   later in the day than earlier in the day.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:37.020]   If you're going back to a boldness regret and you want to ask out your, you know,
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.500]   someone who you're interested in, if you wait till later in the day,
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.100]   there's some evidence that you're going to just give up.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.420]   Whereas if you do it early in the day,
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.700]   you might be able to summon a little bit more moxie.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.620]   Well, you know, there's plenty more in the book and we didn't even hit on,
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.780]   you know, four or five other books. So lots to check out,
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.220]   lots of links in the show notes. Before we go, you know,
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.860]   you mentioned you had some hacks that span outside of these books.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.820]   There's some boxes in the corner you referenced. I'd love to hear your, you know,
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.500]   some of the general things that you do or recommend to kind of optimize life and
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.020]   everything else. Well, I mean, I do a lot of different things.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.660]   So you you're seeing in my, in my office here,
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.380]   my garage behind my house in Washington, DC, I have these box.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.580]   These are bankers boxes that you sometimes will see in like a law firm in the
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.300]   1980s. I love them.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.820]   And what I do is that I have when I have projects that I'm not working on right
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.380]   now, the projects that I'm imagining for the future,
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.940]   some of which may go somewhere, some of which may not,
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:38.220]   what I will do is I will establish a physical box for each of those things.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:42.700]   And then when I see something, a newspaper article, or I hear about a book,
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.740]   I heard about a book today.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.300]   Somebody mentioned a book that was related to something here.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.460]   So when I get the book, I'm not going to read that book right now,
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:53.100]   but I'm gonna take that book, plop it in that box,
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.140]   because that way is a way for me to collect all the material that I think might
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.620]   be relevant to that particular project,
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.100]   but that I'm not ready to deal with right now.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.820]   So these boxes for me are an incredible organizing, incredible organizing tool,
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.500]   even though it's very analog. I still use, I use Evernote sometimes,
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.940]   I still use Dropbox, but for me, the physical boxes are so useful.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.620]   I see a magazine story or I see something online, I print it out,
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.940]   pop it in the box. I get a book, pop it in the box. And,
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.820]   and what happens then is to my surprise, it's, you know,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.100]   it's like a holiday morning. It's like, Oh, well,
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.340]   I was thinking about working on that, make a documentary about X, Y, or Z.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:37.620]   And then I look at the box like, Holy moly, who put all this stuff in here?
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:41.500]   This is great. I got like all kinds of research material right here.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.660]   If I didn't have a system for that, I would be lost.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:50.300]   And so for me, having various kinds of systems to capture ideas is super useful.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.460]   I also use something called a spark file.
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.060]   I don't even know where this even came from, which again,
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.020]   it's just a running document that I store in Dropbox.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.860]   And let's say that I have a question. Let's say that I have an idea.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.860]   I think of a phrase, Hey, that would be a good book title.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:10.740]   I just pop it on that spark file and periodically go back to that. You know,
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.900]   maybe every three or four months to see what's on there is a long list of things.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.380]   So it could be a, it could be a question, you know, maybe I say, Oh wow,
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.780]   our left-hander is more likely to be libertarians like that.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.660]   I've noticed a lot of left-handers are libertarians. Is that a thing?
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.220]   You know? And I was like, I don't feel like researching that right now.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.620]   It's kind of an intriguing question.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.500]   It's not that urgent and essential in my life at this moment,
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   but it's kind of intriguing.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.220]   Put it on the spark file out of my head into a system or even things like I'll
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.980]   think of a book title and I don't even know what the book is,
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.900]   but put it on there and I go through it. And a lot of this stuff,
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.020]   when I look at it later on, it doesn't make any, it's like, okay,
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:51.220]   this is not that interesting, but some stuff sticks. And again, having systems,
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.260]   getting stuff out.
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.260]   This is I'm a big believer in the getting things done methodology of David Allen
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.620]   from 30, 25 years ago. I still am a devotee of that,
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.660]   but basically devotee, especially of the core principle,
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.940]   which is get it out of your head into a system.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.220]   Don't rely on keeping things in your head.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:13.180]   Use your head for the things that your head you really need your head for,
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.780]   which is problem solving and creation, not for storage.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.460]   Yeah. Two things I've used. There's a Chrome extension called one tab.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.860]   And sometimes I'll just be researching something.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.020]   I'll have all these tabs open. I'm like, I don't have time for this.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.780]   Click one button. All the tabs disappear.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.180]   You can always go back and find them grouped by whenever you click the button.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:35.660]   And what I'll say is it's kind of like a graveyard of things that actually didn't
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.060]   matter. You know, that I go back there. I'm like, gosh,
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.260]   why did I go down a rabbit hole here? I don't even care.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.380]   And there's this great like delete this. I never need it.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.420]   And then the other is whenever I find links that someone shared posted on
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.060]   Twitter and I'm like, Oh, I want to read that. I just send it to,
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.660]   I think I sent it to reminders on my iPhone. And I'm like, you know,
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.260]   one day I can go back and scroll through that. And oftentimes I don't,
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.220]   but it at least it kind of gives me the satisfaction of I acknowledge the link
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.380]   without having to read it now. And I don't feel, you know,
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.900]   to go back full circle, I don't feel the regret of not clicking.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.740]   I can eliminate the regret of not looking at it by saving it for later,
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.940]   but not actually looking at it.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.220]   Out of your head into a system. I use something similar to that.
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.980]   I've been using it for a long time. And you know,
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.340]   I think what happens sometimes it's called Instapaper,
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.300]   which is simply a their extensions or buttons on I think every browser now
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.300]   where you see an article online, let's say it's a long form article.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.580]   It's 3000 words.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.420]   I'm not going to sit there in the midst of a mall of a day and read a 3000 word
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.820]   article on my computer. But if I hit the Instapaper button,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.980]   it saves it. And then I go on my iPad and read the stories like that.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.380]   I love Instapaper.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.980]   That's great. Yeah. I used to, I use an app called pocket,
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.980]   which I think is kind of the same thing.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.060]   Same thing. It's pocket is, you know, I, the only, it's like,
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.980]   I use Instapaper because I started using Instapaper. Yeah.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.980]   If I started using pocket, I'd be using pocket,
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.500]   but it's the same basic principle. Yeah. Any other final hacks?
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.020]   I got so many man. So, um,
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.420]   one of the smartest things I've done is I keep a,
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:09.540]   a notebook next to my bed and it's called a line a day notebook.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:14.740]   And every day I write down one line that I've heard a sentence, a phrase,
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.020]   a question, a quotation that I've heard.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.500]   And I usually capture them like on my phone. I take a photograph of it.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.940]   And then I just render it in the, but actually with,
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.660]   with a pen in this book. And so I've done this every, uh, this book.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.100]   Now I'm on year four.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:34.100]   So every day for three plus years.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.980]   So there's way over a thousand little entries in there. Wow.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.380]   And what do you do with them? I go back and look at them.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.060]   Sometimes I write down jokes.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.580]   And so it allows me to like remember jokes that I wouldn't ever before.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.780]   Other times I'll write down a sentence that I read is really intriguing.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.380]   That just helps me think through. It's like, Oh, why,
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:54.140]   why does that sentence work so well? But again, you know, I have to say the,
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.900]   the habit of it on that one is also really important because what it does more
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.180]   than anything else, it makes me pay attention in the day.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.500]   It makes me attuned to hearing and seeing great things because you know,
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.100]   you're going to, because I know I'm going to write something down. Yeah.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.260]   I like that a lot.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.780]   I feel like it's very easy to get distracted throughout the day and not pay
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.180]   attention. But if you have a goal at the end of the day of,
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.900]   I'm going to write one thing down, you got to find that thing. Right.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.700]   And when you find that thing,
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.900]   you just take a picture of it or I send some days we'll send myself an email.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.740]   Here's today's. So the story in the Washington post that I read,
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.860]   it happened to be about the NFL.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:28.180]   There's a very good sports writer for the Washington post named Adam Kilgore.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:32.780]   And he had, he was writing about the NFL and he had a line,
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:36.140]   a couple of lines about football and the NFL that I just thought was just
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.020]   brilliant writing. And so I just literally took a photograph of it. I'm,
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.780]   and, and tonight I'll transcribe that into my little notebook.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.100]   The book, uh, you know, we talked about regret a lot at the beginning,
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.860]   but the books out today, other than, uh,
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.980]   buying the book and reading it and enjoying it,
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.700]   where can people follow you online?
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.180]   Well, you can go to my website, which is Dan pink.com.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:00.300]   And there's all kinds of groovy stuff there. And you know,
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.380]   you can find the books as they say, wherever books are sold.
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.460]   There's a lot of stuff, a lot of research reports.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.900]   We'll link up to all of them in the show notes as well as the book. Cool.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.260]   Thanks for doing that. I appreciate it.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.180]   I just hope that Manu Ginobili listens to this. Yeah, I will. You know, he,
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.780]   he was the one that sent me a list. He's like, Hey,
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:19.740]   if you could have a couple of these people on, and he had your name on there,
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.060]   I was like, okay, you know, I got to reach out, reach out.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:27.060]   Because actually I got some street credit with my son a few years ago when I
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:31.740]   showed him that, um, Manu Ginobili and Powell Gasol followed me on Twitter.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:34.460]   Wow. So that's pretty good. I have to say.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.220]   That's how the Manu thing started for me was I noticed he followed me and I sent
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.900]   him a note. So he's quite responsive. You should reach out. Yeah, I should.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.780]   Well, cool. Thank you so much for being here. Chris,
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.460]   what a pleasure being with you. I really enjoyed it.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.500]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening.
