[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.200]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.920]   Now, today is an exciting episode because I'm joined by the one and only Dan Pink,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.240]   who is the author of several provocative bestselling books about business, work,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.200]   creativity, and behavior, including the latest, The Power of Regret, How Looking
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.920]   Back Moves Us Forward, which comes out the same day this episode will.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.720]   His previous books, When, Drive, To Sell as Human, and A Whole New Mind were all
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440]   New York Times bestsellers, collectively spending more than five years on the
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.240]   bestseller list.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.360]   They've won countless awards, sold millions of copies, and have been translated
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.120]   into 42 languages around the world.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.240]   And if that's not enough, his TED Talk on the Science of Motivation is one of the
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   10 most watched TED Talks of all time.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.080]   Today, we'll talk about how regret works, how it can help us make smarter
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.000]   decisions, perform better at work, and bring greater meaning to our lives.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.680]   We'll also dig into some of the best hacks he's learned about
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.360]   timing, motivation, and more.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.720]   Oh, and I saved the best for last.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.800]   Dan is actually a fellow All The Hacks listener, which makes
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.120]   this one even more special.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.360]   So I'm excited.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Let's jump in.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   Dan, I've enjoyed your books for years.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.240]   Congrats on this one.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.320]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.920]   I have a whole bunch of questions about how to maximize my frequent flyer points.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   So if we can begin with that.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.600]   No, no, I'm a longtime listener, first time caller.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.360]   I do love the, I do love the travel stuff.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   I also happen to be a Manu Ginobili fan and I couldn't believe you got him a
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.640]   couple of years or maybe about a year ago.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.360]   Yeah, that episode was fun.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.680]   He doesn't do a lot of podcasts.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.920]   In fact, the one I had been able to find to try to get a sense of
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.280]   his style was all in Spanish.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.080]   So I had to find it on YouTube with subtitles to try to get a feel for his flow.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.960]   I remember when he, when Manu Ginobili, so I'm a big basketball fan.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   My, my, my son is a big basketball fan.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.040]   And, and when Manu was playing, my son would always say, because Manu
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.360]   was like lost a lot of his hair.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.280]   He looks as old as you, dad.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.600]   He looks as old as you.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   Yeah, it hurts.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.520]   My daughter's just learning to speak and I'm like, I'm faithfully worried about
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.840]   all these comments that I'm going to get.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   Yeah, it's over.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   You don't want to, don't, don't teach your kids to speak.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.360]   It'll just cause you trouble down the road.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.920]   So, uh, before we jump in, I got to ask, is there, do you have
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   a favorite episode from the show?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Well, I liked the Manu.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.600]   I liked the Manu and, but I have to say it like for me, it's the cumulative thing.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.720]   It's like, I've learned so much about, especially about travel and what to ask
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.120]   for and contacting general managers and reaching out in advance and all that
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.920]   kind of stuff, it's been super useful to me because travel is such a pain in the
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.040]   ass sometimes that if you can do small things to mitigate that, it really
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.080]   enriches the experience.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.240]   And the other thing that it does, I think in some level is it
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.440]   personalizes it a little bit.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.080]   It brings a little bit more humanity to it.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.240]   So it's not only the art of the deal, which I like getting the good deals,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560]   maximizing the points, but it's also some of the people you end up encountering
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.840]   in trying to maximize your travels.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   So thanks for, thanks for doing that.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.960]   I mean, I love it.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.680]   So expect more, but I read most of this book, you know, I've
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.480]   only had it a couple of days, but I'd like to just kick off for everyone listening.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.720]   I think regret is something we throw around a lot and people say, oh, no regrets.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.760]   And how would you actually explain to people listening?
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.840]   What regret is?
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.880]   Great, great question.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.160]   So regret is an emotion and it's a negative emotion.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.680]   It feels terrible.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   So it's that stomach churning sensation we have when we look back and say,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.920]   oh, if only I hadn't done that, if only I had done that, if only
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   I had made a different choice.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.760]   And so it's actually an incredible capacity of our minds to be able to
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.320]   travel back and forth in time, but ultimately it's an emotion that makes
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.800]   us feel bad, that's why we try to avoid it, but it's also an emotion that is to
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.240]   my mind, the most instructive emotion that we have, but you said instructive.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.840]   I saw somewhere online, you talk about the surprising path to the good
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.240]   life when talking about regret.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.120]   So I got to ask, why does regret matter so much?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.240]   Why can it be so powerful?
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.800]   Okay.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.480]   Well, I mean, so that's a whole kettle of fish there, but
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.520]   let me take it in two parts.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.640]   First of all, regret matters so much because everybody has regrets.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.960]   I mean, truly every person, every, essentially every
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.880]   functioning person has regrets.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.360]   The only people without regrets are five-year-olds who, because their brains
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   haven't developed because it takes some cognitive firepower to even
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   experience a process regret.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   People with brain lesions, people with neurodegenerative diseases often
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.920]   can't experience regret and sociopaths.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.080]   The rest of us have regrets because it's part of the human condition.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.040]   It's an essential part of our cognitive machinery.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.600]   And the reason it's part of our cognitive machinery is because it's
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.920]   helpful if we deal with it right, that regret instructs, regret clarifies.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.400]   Now we have to approach it right.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.920]   We can blithely say, "Oh, I don't have any regrets.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.800]   I never look backward."
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.080]   That's stupid.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.720]   That's going to lead to delusion.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.080]   You can also say, "Oh my God, everything is, I regret everything.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.280]   I'm going to spin around and wallow in my regrets."
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.880]   That's an even worse idea.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.320]   What we have to do is recognize that regret is teaching us, it's signaling to us.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   And if we do that, I mean, I'm telling you, it is the most transformative
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.440]   emotion we have if we process it right.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.960]   I know I always regretted every financial investment decision I've made when it
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   turned out that it was the poor decision, which is easy to do in hindsight.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   And a really good friend of mine once always asked me, I was like, "Oh man, I
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.640]   sold this thing.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.480]   I should have held onto it."
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.800]   And he goes, "Well, with all the information you had when you did it, was
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.720]   it the right decision?
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   Like if you had that information again today?"
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.040]   And I was like, "Well, I guess I would do it that way."
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.280]   And that kind of helped.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.840]   But I'm sure we'll get into a few more tactics.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.760]   Oh, sure, sure, sure.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.720]   There are all kinds of tactics.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.960]   And the other thing is, as you mentioned about the good life, is that, you know, I
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.320]   went out for this book and I collected 16,000 regrets from people in 105
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.720]   countries.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.680]   I mean, I have this massive database of regrets because I was curious about what
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.560]   do people regret?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.000]   And I felt like in the existing research, there were some holes in that.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.680]   Or even in my own existence, I did another research project where I tried to figure
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.960]   that out and I hit a wall.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.120]   But I also collected these 16,000 regrets.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.960]   We're up to over 17,000 now from 105 countries.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.560]   It's nuts.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.080]   And what I found is that over and over again, people around the world regret the
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.320]   same four things.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.400]   And that's what gives us a hint about the good life, that these four core regrets
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.320]   operate as kind of a photographic negative of the good life.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.440]   That is, we understand what people regret the most.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.480]   We actually understand what they value the most.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.440]   And so in this weird way, you asked at the top, Chris, what is this thing regret?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.840]   And I said, it's an emotion that makes us feel bad.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.520]   But weirdly, this emotion that makes us feel bad contains the clues to what we
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.640]   ultimately want out of life.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   And what were the four core regrets?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.480]   Well, so we've got let me not answer that question directly and give you a lengthy
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   contextual buildup.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.480]   So one of the things that you see in the existing research on regret, because I
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.160]   mean, developmental psychologists, other people in behavioral science have studied
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.200]   regret for many, many years.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.320]   Economists have studied regret.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.720]   Game theorists have studied regret.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.480]   One of the things that you see is that when they try to figure out what people
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.600]   regret, they sort those by the domain of life.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   Let me give you a concrete example.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.840]   This will be easier.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   So I have people who say my big regret is that I was in college and I didn't study
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.760]   abroad. OK, not the most calamitous regret, but hundreds of those hundreds of
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.000]   those. I actually think you could start a travel agency serving people who didn't
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.240]   study abroad in college and regret.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.440]   I'm dead serious about that.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.120]   There's a business in there somewhere.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.080]   OK, so that's an education regret.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.160]   Then I have people who say and this is an amazing one and I have literally hundreds
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.880]   around the world that say blankety blank years ago, I met a man or a woman who I
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.040]   really liked. I wanted to ask him or her out on a date, but I was too chicken to do
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.680]   that. And I've always regretted it.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.040]   That's a romance regret.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:30.160]   Then we have, again, hundreds who say, oh, I stayed in this crappy job.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.280]   And if only I'd started a business, I always wanted to start a business, but I
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.480]   never got around to it. I never had the guts to do it.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.920]   OK, that's a career regret.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.000]   But to my mind, those are all the same regret.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.040]   Deep down, those are all the same regret.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.280]   That's a regret that says, if only I'd taken the chance.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.480]   And that's one of the core regrets is the regret of boldness.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.800]   If only I'd taken the chance.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.600]   There's a little bit of a head fake going on in that we're looking at the domains of
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.720]   life, career and education and health and whatnot.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.400]   And when what was going on was something actually much more important underneath.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.760]   So one regret is boldness, regrets.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.000]   If only I'd taken the chance.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   One big regret that people have are what I call foundation regrets, which is if only
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.880]   I'd done the work. And these are people who regret smoking, who regret not exercising,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.400]   taking care of their body, who regret not saving money, not working hard enough in
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.360]   school, small decisions early that accumulate to big consequences later on.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.200]   There are moral regrets.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.440]   And those are interesting because a lot of these regrets begin at a juncture.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.800]   You're at a juncture. You can do the right thing.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.760]   You can do the wrong thing.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.000]   People do the wrong thing.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   And a lot of them regret it.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.640]   So I got all kinds of people who regret bullying kids in school, marital infidelity,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.120]   huge things like that.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.040]   And then finally, our connection regrets.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.480]   And those are regrets about relationships that were intact or should have been intact.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.720]   They come apart. Someone wants to reach out, but they say, oh, it's going to be really
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.040]   awkward to reach out. And the other side's not going to care.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.920]   So they drift even further apart.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.360]   And so connection regrets are if only I'd reached out.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.840]   And to me, what these tell us, 105 countries over and over again, what do we regret?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.160]   We regret not doing the work.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.600]   We regret not taking a chance.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.520]   We regret not doing the right thing.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.280]   We regret not reaching out.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.400]   And that tells us what we want.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.800]   What do we want? We want some stability in our life.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.880]   We want a chance to do something, to lead an interesting life and grow and have a
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.600]   psychologically rich existence.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.080]   Most of us, I'm convinced, want to do the right thing.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.640]   And we feel crappy when we don't.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.560]   And what do we want? We want connection and love with other people.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.520]   That's it. And so my trying to understand this emotion of regret took me to this
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.720]   unexpected place where I said, wait a second, these people who are expressing their
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.160]   regrets are telling me what they want out of life.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.480]   And I think it's very clear now.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.000]   Do they all apply to everyone or is there some kind of formula to know who they're most
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.600]   important to by age or by anything else?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   Super interesting question.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.760]   So I also did a quantitative piece of research on a U.S.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.840]   population where we did a pretty good public opinion poll of 4,489 Americans to try
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.240]   to get at some demographic differences so we can do crosstabs to say, OK, do men have
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   different regrets than women do?
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.600]   Do African-Americans have different regrets from white people and so forth?
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.840]   And what we found is not that many demographic differences.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.360]   The big demographic difference comes out on age.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.560]   When people are young, let's say in their 20s, they have about the same number of
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.360]   regrets of action and inaction, same number of regrets about what they did and what
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.040]   they didn't do. But as people age, inaction regrets take over.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.280]   People have many more inaction regrets as they as they age.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.200]   Can you give some examples of inaction regrets that people older might have?
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.080]   If only I traveled more, if only I had reached out to my brother before he passed
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.800]   away, if only I had started a business, if only I had spoken up at work, those kinds
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.040]   of things. So fewer regrets about, oh, I did this.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.240]   And if we were regrets, I heard somebody and I regret doing that.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.560]   More about I didn't do the thing that I always wanted to do.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.040]   I wasn't true to myself.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.680]   I didn't lead a life of meaning and significance.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.240]   Yeah, it's funny. We I spoke with Ben Nimton.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.520]   I don't know if you know him, who was in this show called The Buried Life and went on
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.680]   to write a bucket list journal.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.880]   And the whole thing was kind of inspired by the first of the five regrets of the dying,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.120]   which is I didn't leave a life true to myself.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.080]   And so we talked a bit about that, but it was more in the spirit of kind of all the
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.960]   things you can put on your list to do.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.720]   So to kind of juxtapose that, I'm going to ask you now that you know all this, what
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   advice do you have for people to use these regrets to kind of live the good life, if
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.040]   you will? I'll tell you one that changed me, Chris, and is on the connection regrets.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.160]   I don't want to get woo on you here.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.200]   You can, you know, at some level, when you work on a project, any kind of project, you
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.040]   know, if you're starting a business or doing a pot like you're a different person when
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.720]   you started this podcast than you than you are on this episode.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.320]   Right. We change over time.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.040]   And so I'm a different person than when I started this book a few years ago.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.360]   Now that I spent all this time immersed in the research on regret and talking to hundreds
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.960]   of people about regret and reading thousands of regrets, I'm a different person.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   And the person I am today has a belief in essentially an unshakable belief now on this
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.480]   one dimension, which is this.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.240]   If you if one, if I, you, anybody is at a juncture in your life and you're wondering,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.960]   should I reach out? The fact that you made it to that juncture answers the question.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.240]   Always reach out.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   If there is any single lesson for me in this research, it is always reach out.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.080]   I got all these people around the world who say, oh, I wanted to reach out to my friend
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.640]   or to this person who I used to know, but I thought it was going to be awkward.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   So I didn't do it. And they wouldn't care anyway.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.960]   And they're always wrong on that front.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.880]   It's much less awkward than we think.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.760]   And it's almost always well received.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.920]   So one, I don't even want to call it a hack as much as it is a habit of the heart, which
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.120]   is always reach out.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.760]   If you're thinking about it, reach out.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.400]   Another thing, always go to funerals.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.320]   I mean it. I guess I have that regret myself.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.160]   A friend of mine, not a close friend, passed away several years ago.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.680]   I worked with him and he was a little older than I was and he had a funeral and it's
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.640]   embarrassing to me.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.680]   The funeral was literally, the service was literally walking distance from my house.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.480]   And on that particular day, I intended to go, but I got swept up in some deadline or
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.000]   something like that and I didn't go.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.920]   This was maybe 15 years ago and I still regret it.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.960]   So always go to the funeral.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.280]   Always reach out.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.240]   I think you have to think very hard if you're at a juncture where you can do the right
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.320]   thing or do the wrong thing.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.280]   I think you've got to think very hard about whether you want to do the wrong thing
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.600]   because I got people for whom doing the wrong thing is lingering in their souls for
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.200]   decades, for decades.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.440]   OK, so that's kind of the moral and the connection.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   What about knowing how much you might regret not being bold?
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.280]   Is there something you can do to kind of fix or prepare yourself for avoiding the
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.200]   regret of boldness?
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.880]   So one thing that you can do and we can talk more about how to take existing regrets and
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.400]   transform them because there's interesting practices to do.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.920]   So I'll give you, in some ways, the best decision making hack that I know of any kind,
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.760]   but it applies very forcefully to regret.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.000]   And it's this, what would you tell your best friend to do?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.760]   Let's say you have a regret about boldness and you're at another juncture.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.520]   You didn't leave a job to start a business.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.440]   Now you're in a new job.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.120]   You don't like that job.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.200]   You want to start a business.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.360]   Your friend comes to you with that regret.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.880]   What would you tell him or her to do?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.720]   And when you apply that, I'll see your hack and call it a heuristic, you know, a mental
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.520]   shortcut, right?
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.440]   When you apply that heuristic, what would you tell your best friend to do?
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.280]   People always know what to do.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.040]   So that's one thing that you can do to act on a boldness regret.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.680]   Now, is there a more systematic way to deal with and process your regrets that I think
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.480]   is useful to people?
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.480]   So that's where I kind of wanted to go is some of these, I can plan for these future
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.440]   regrets and what I might do if I'm thinking, oh, should I reach out?
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.640]   The answer is always yes.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.400]   But what about all the regrets we already have?
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.240]   I think there are three steps here in doing this.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.000]   So the first step is to reframe how you think about the regret and how you think about
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.880]   yourself. Now, once again, a lot of the way we deal with emotions is a form of
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.320]   triangulation. All right.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.960]   So in the same way that we don't want to ignore our regrets or wallow in them, we want
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   to confront them. When we look at our regrets in ourselves, some of us are tempted to say,
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   oh, I'm awesome anyway, boost our self-esteem.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.200]   Other people are tempted to lacerate themselves with self-criticism.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.040]   The better option is something called self-compassion, which is the brainchild of
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.400]   Kristen Neff, a psychologist at the University of Texas.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.640]   And what she has found is it's very simple and straightforward.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.880]   So when you have a regret, let's say that I have a regret about somebody bullied a kid
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.720]   in school and is really bothered by that even 20 years later.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.680]   What you can do is you can you sort of show yourself some.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.560]   So if a friend came to you with this regret, would you show them kindness or contempt?
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.360]   You probably would show them some kindness.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.840]   So show yourself that kind of kindness.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.120]   Do you think that this regret is part of the human condition or do you think you're the
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.520]   only one who's ever suffered from it?
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.640]   Believe me, you're not the only one.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.240]   All right. So let yourself off the hook a little bit.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.760]   And treating ourselves with self-compassion rather than self-criticism or
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.320]   self-esteem actually is the best way to avoid complacency.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   Self-compassion. Number two, disclose it, man.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:33.960]   I mean, the research on disclosure is powerful that when we disclose our regrets, we
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.200]   should be talking about these things.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.280]   We shouldn't be bottling them up.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.160]   When we disclose our regrets, we unburden them.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.120]   We lift the burden.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.960]   The other thing that we do, which is when we take these blobby emotion that we talked
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.480]   about at the top of the show, right, regret is an emotion.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.320]   It feels bad, but it's kind of amorphous.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.600]   It's kind of it's a kind of abstract.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.640]   When we take that abstraction and convert it into words by talking about it, even
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.160]   writing about it, you take away some of the steam.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   It makes it less fearsome.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.320]   So the act of converting it to language makes the regret less fearsome.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.880]   The other thing about self-disclosure is that we think that if we disclose our
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.120]   vulnerabilities, people will like us less.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.480]   Nope. There's 30 years of research that says they like us more.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.240]   Finally, extract a lesson from it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   So the way that you extract a lesson from it is you do some self-distancing.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   You say, if I'm looking back on this in 10 years, what do I want to have done?
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.480]   If someone else were in my position, what would they do?
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   You can even do self-distancing through language.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.560]   So you, Chris, could say instead of saying to yourself, what should I do?
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.720]   Say, what should Chris do?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.360]   Even changing to the third person.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   And so you reframe it by treating yourself with self-compassion.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   You disclose it and make it less fearsome by converting it into words and you
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   extract a lesson from it.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.280]   And so if I regret bullying somebody, I say, you know what, I'm going to treat myself
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.640]   with some compassion that doesn't fully define me.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.760]   Two, I'm going to tell people about it because that's going to unburden it.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.640]   And I'm going to make sense of it by talking about it.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.120]   And three, I'm going to extract a lesson from it.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.760]   And the lesson is that I'm not a kid anymore, but in my in my office, I'm
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.640]   certainly going to treat people with kindness.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   If I see someone in my office bullying somebody in a way that adults bully, I'm
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.360]   going to stand up and say something and I'm going to transmit this knowledge to my
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.800]   kids about this experience and what they can learn from it.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.400]   Wow. But but again, I mean, I don't want to make it sound more more complicated than
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.560]   it really is, but it's really about sort of look inward, treat yourself with some
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.840]   kindness, express outward, disclose it, move forward, extract a lesson from it.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.080]   That's the way to do it.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.760]   And what you don't do is what you were saying earlier, where you say, I don't have
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.560]   any regrets, no regrets, no regrets.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.080]   I bully kids, but I don't have any regrets.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.040]   That's crazy.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   Once you've done this, so this is kind of dealing with all of your past regrets.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.320]   Do you recommend just like sit down one day and kind of think about them and go
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.240]   through them? Or I would start with one.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.480]   I would start with one that's bugging you and everybody has one that's bugging them.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.840]   I know that because seventeen thousand people have disclosed the one that's bugging
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.360]   them to me. OK, so pick one that's bugging from you and work that through inward.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.240]   Treat yourself with kindness outward, disclose and make sense of it forward.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.480]   Extract a lesson from it.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.000]   That's how you do it. You know, another thing that you can do in this in this process
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.120]   of reckoning with it is that there's certain kinds of events, certain kinds of
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.320]   regrets that we have that we can undo.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.040]   Like I got people in my in my book who have no regrets tattoos.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.360]   They have tattoos that say no regrets.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:32.640]   And then I have a guy who said who got a no regrets tattoo and regretted it and had
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.880]   it removed. OK, so that's how you that's how you undo a regret.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.520]   I'll give you another idea here.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.280]   So let's let's talk about career regrets.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.880]   Here is a hack, one of my favorite hacks.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.520]   It comes from Tina Seelig at Stanford University.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.520]   It's called a failure resume.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.320]   This is one of the smartest things you can do as a professional.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.000]   So we all have these resumes, these glistening things that talk about how awesome
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.080]   we are and all of our accomplishments and credentials.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.720]   Tina Seelig at Stanford suggests that we also do a failure resume, which is the
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.200]   opposite of that, which is a list of all of our screw ups and failures and setbacks.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.760]   You list those.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   You don't have to tell anybody about it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.440]   I've done this. I didn't tell anybody about it.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.480]   It's I mean, I told people that I did it.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.920]   I'm not showing anybody this thing because it's embarrassing as hell.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.120]   A list of your failures, setbacks and mistakes.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   But you don't just leave it there.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.440]   Then you say, OK, what did I learn from this?
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.120]   And then what am I going to do?
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.960]   The failure resume is one of the best things that professionals can do.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.800]   And then just store it somewhere.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.000]   And do you come back and reflect on it on some particular cadence or how do you use it?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.280]   Oh, it depends. It depends.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.200]   Because you can also like the way I did it, which is not exactly what Tina recommends.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   But the way that I did it is list basically three columns, list the failure, setbacks,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:54.080]   screw up, whatever, list the lesson and then say next time I will blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.160]   For me, what happened, though, it was interesting.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.240]   And I think that the exercise itself is revealing, because for me, what I found is
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.760]   that, you know, some things that I did that didn't work out, that sort of flopped.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.240]   But it was like the stock that you mentioned.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.480]   It's like, yeah, I might do it again.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.920]   It's like I was I was out of my control.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.240]   It's actually not so much a failure as it is like life happens.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.120]   And sometimes things work out and sometimes they don't.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:20.000]   And that's OK. But on some of the things I found myself making when I looked at the list
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.840]   of lessons, I had two lessons that kept coming up over and over again.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.080]   I was making the same two mistakes over and over and over again.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.400]   And they were in some ways the infection at the heart of some of these problems.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.280]   And I've done a good job subsequently of not making those mistakes again.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.480]   But the only reason I was able to really surface those two mistakes was by doing a failure
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.120]   resume. And is that something that helps you in the future?
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.720]   Or I know you have a kind of a framework for regret optimization.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.440]   And when you think about how to plan for a lot of people get worried about anticipating
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.200]   regret. Yeah. Is this a prereq to that framework?
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.760]   I don't think it's a it's a prerequisite.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.840]   I don't think it's a post-requisite.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.880]   I think it is it can live alongside.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   Again, I don't think that there is a single universal one size fits all prescription.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.600]   What I want to try to do is get people to rethink regret, normalize it, recognize that
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.360]   everybody has it and try to learn from the regrets, learn what people regret, because
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.920]   I think it points a path to a good life and have some tools and hacks and things that
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   they can do to deal with a particular regret or two in their own life as a starting point.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.560]   So for some people, they care very deeply about their careers.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.640]   And so I totally recommend it for that.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.760]   Now we can talk about anticipated regret, which is a really, really interesting issue.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.240]   You know, we can talk about why Jeff Bezos was right and wrong to some extent.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   We can also talk about, OK, so I'm into the hack thing now, Chris.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.360]   All right. Here's a hack for all you kids out there stuck taking multiple choice tests,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.320]   taking a multiple choice test. It's question 11.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.640]   You think the answer is A. You move along in the test.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.040]   I think, wait a second, maybe the answer to question 11 is C.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.760]   So here's the question. Should you change your answer?
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.000]   Should you change your answer now?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.360]   If this it would be great if like we had this is like a call in podcast where people would
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   call in and tell me. But if you I've done a poll on this asking this question overwhelmingly,
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.520]   people say, oh, no, no, you got to go with your first instinct.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.880]   And that's certainly what I was taught in the public schools of Columbus, Ohio, 100
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.680]   years ago. Always go with your first instinct.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.000]   Don't change your answer. Your first instinct is going to be more accurate than changing
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.200]   the answer.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.040]   We have research on this and the research says that's wrong.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.320]   Change your fricking answer. People are more likely to switch from a wrong answer to a
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.600]   right answer than a right answer to the wrong answer.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:52.420]   What hobbles them is anticipated regret gone awry because what happens is that they anticipate
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:59.280]   greater regret from the fear of switching from a right answer to a wrong answer than
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   the fear of sticking with the wrong answer.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.920]   And so they don't make the optimal decision.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.040]   So a lot of times when we anticipate our regret, we actually end up making very risk averse
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040]   choices.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.560]   And so anticipated regret is not all good.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.600]   It's mostly good, but there is a way to there's a way to reckon with.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.360]   The other thing about anticipated regret is that, as you were suggesting earlier, Chris,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.400]   we need to pick what we're going to focus on.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.200]   And so if you say, oh, am I going to regret buying a blue car or a gray car?
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.720]   Am I going to regret wearing my black sweater or my blue sweater?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.600]   Am I going to regret having macaroni and cheese for dinner or turkey Tetrazzini?
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.880]   I mean, you can go crazy on this, on our decision making, and I'm sure your listeners are familiar
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   with this.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.280]   I mean, you'll see it in any social psychology textbook or class.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.760]   The difference between maximizers and satisficers, people who are maximizers try to make the
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.600]   best decision on every single thing they do.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.700]   Satisficers say there's some things where good enough is good enough.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.020]   And what the research tells us very clearly is maximizers are miserable.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.160]   They're just miserable.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.560]   And satisficers are happier.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.680]   And the key really is to satisfice on most things, but maximize on the things that matter
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.800]   the most.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.920]   And that is, again, regret points is that way.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.760]   So if you're anticipating your regrets, you say, am I going to regret not doing the work?
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.960]   Yeah, you're going to regret not doing the work.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.760]   Am I going to regret not taking the risk?
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   Yep.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   You're going to regret that.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.000]   Am I going to regret not doing the right thing?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Yep.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.480]   Am I going to regret not reaching out?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   Yep.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.360]   Am I going to regret buying a blue car?
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.880]   Probably not in a few years.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.040]   Am I going to regret taking a vacation to place A or place B?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.200]   Probably not in a few years.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.600]   So what you have to do is you have to maximize on what's important in your anticipated regrets.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.800]   And satisfies on everything else.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.200]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   emerge.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.920]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.360]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:12.840]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, one, 37,000.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.280]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.160]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.680]   It is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial management,
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.040]   inventory, HR, and more.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.880]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.320]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.840]   weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   And one, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.800]   all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.

[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.840]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.800]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.480]   N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.700]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.300]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.320]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.240]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.840]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.880]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.940]   commonly found in plants.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:59.400]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.460]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel-friendly.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.920]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.720]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kick-start digestion and
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.800]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably one of my favorite
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.140]   things to drink.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.740]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.640]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.200]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.160]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.800]   U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.440]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.480]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.580]   What hacks might you have for someone who's in the middle of something they probably won't
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.200]   anticipate regret on but stuck, like, "Ah, you know, I got these two hotels, I can't
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   pick between them.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   They both look great."
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.120]   Is it just, you know, it's easy to tell someone, "Just do this one," and maybe that's the question.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   Ask what your friend would tell them.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.360]   You know, "What would you tell your friend?
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   Just pick one."
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.120]   Okay, so multiple hacks on that one, Chris.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.000]   Okay, so what would you tell your best friend to do, okay?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Here's my favorite one.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I don't know where I got this.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.420]   Let's say you're trying to decide where to go.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.960]   So I'm going to go to, you know, should I go to Croatia or should I go to Greece, all
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.960]   right?
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.200]   Let's say it's equally priced or whatever, all right?
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.720]   So we're sort of in the same more or less kind of sort of region, kind of.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.340]   But you just can't decide, you're paralyzed by that, okay?
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.320]   First of all, you're going to be fine because you get to go to either Croatia or Greece.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.000]   So you're going to be fine, all right?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.020]   So you flip a coin, heads is Croatia, and tails is Greece, all right?
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.540]   You flip a coin.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:58.400]   When the coin gets to its apex, you think, "How do I want this to turn out in that instant?"
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.560]   And that's your answer right there.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.120]   I thought you were going to go for what it landed on, but I like it more now.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.560]   Because the thing is, it's like you sort of know.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.880]   You actually, you know, you're 50% in a peppercorn in one direction or another.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   And that moment when it hits its apex is when you say it sort of is revealed to you.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   But this is my point.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.080]   It's like, you're going to be fine.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.480]   You're going to go to Croatia and say, "Croatia is awesome."
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.200]   You're going to go to Greece and say, "Greece is awesome."
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.800]   The big thing there is like, gee, you know, should I take the risk of going to, you know,
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.400]   it's like, should I go to Croatia, you know, I don't speak Serbo-Croatian, and I'm not
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.480]   sure about some of the places to stay, and I've never been to that part of the world
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.760]   before, so maybe I should just play it safe and go to Hilton Head or something like that,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   you know.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.680]   And there you will have a regret because that's about boldness.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.760]   And we have a lot of, I mean, it's interesting for your show, Chris, we have a lot of regrets
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.840]   about people not traveling, not taking the chance to travel to cool places.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.360]   I've talked in the past about how easy it can be, right?
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.000]   One credit card can take a family on a vacation.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.080]   My goal is to help people get rid of, you know, if there's a thing holding you back,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.500]   it certainly can't be the cost, you know, at least if you have good credit, I guess.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.080]   Free travel is available.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.200]   Absolutely.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.920]   But the barrier for people isn't when they admit it, when they confess in this online
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.880]   confessional called the World Regret Survey, they very rarely, they don't say, "Oh, I
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.240]   couldn't afford to go to Croatia."
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.240]   And so I decided it's not that.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   It was like, "Ugh."
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   You know, it was a little bit risky because I hadn't traveled abroad and I wasn't sure
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.520]   where to stay.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   And I really regret not taking that risk.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.920]   I've heard a lot of people worried about going places because they say, "Oh, you know, this
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   place isn't safe.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.560]   I don't know."
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.640]   And I think I've mentioned this in the past, but someone was like, "Ah, I read this thing
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   in this book."
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.400]   And they said, "You got to bring the money belt and you got to hide all of your stuff.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.760]   It just seems so dangerous."
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.200]   I was like, "Go read the guide for New York City.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   It says the same thing."
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.880]   And like, you know, I don't put my phone and my wallet in a money belt walking around New
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   York City.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.760]   And so, you know, everything's going to try to make you feel like it could be scary.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.920]   But at the end of the day, I think you're going to be fine in most places.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.360]   I mean, it's not, this is not a good thing, but I live in Washington, D.C. and our neighborhood
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.040]   listserv three days ago talked about a carjacking.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.400]   That's my neighborhood here in Washington, D.C.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.240]   So I'm telling you what people regret is not taking those kinds of trips.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.400]   Did we hit on everything when it comes to anticipating regret?
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.720]   So Jeff Bezos has this idea called the regret minimization principle.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.200]   And so his view is like every decision you make, you should try to minimize your future
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   regrets.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   And that comes from a famous story where, I don't even know if it's true, but he's told
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.160]   it, where he's working as a banker and he's thinking about starting Amazon and the guy,
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.280]   his boss says, "Ah, you're crazy.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.800]   You don't want to do that.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.840]   And you need to think about it."
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.520]   So he's taking a walk in Central Park and he's thinking about it and he says, "Well,
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.440]   what am I going to regret when I'm 80?
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.680]   Am I going to regret taking the chance or am I going to regret not taking the chance?"
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.760]   And he says, "I'll probably regret not taking the chance, so therefore I'm going to do that."
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.880]   Now, that's sensible.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.800]   We can't minimize every single regret, we'll become paralyzed here.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:14.600]   But when we look forward and again, ask these core questions, will I regret not doing the
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   work?
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.200]   Will I regret not taking the chance?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.720]   Will I regret not doing the right thing?
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.040]   Will I regret not reaching out?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.400]   I think the answer, at least in the chorus of 17,000 people who've told me, is that,
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.240]   yeah, those are the things you're going to regret.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.120]   So focus on making really good decisions there and just doing good enough for everything
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   else.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.640]   Is it fair to say those are the maximizer focus areas and the rest you can kind of satisfy
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.640]   us on?
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   Totally.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   It's more than fair.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.240]   It's essential to say that, that that's what you want to maximize on those things because
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.520]   those are the things that give our life meaning.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.820]   And I mean that, we talked a little bit about being a different person.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.660]   I am a different person having heard the voices of all these people for two years.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:01.600]   They are all of them telling me what matters in their lives and they're all telling me
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.920]   the same things.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.680]   And I look at what they're telling me and I'm like, yeah, what do I care about?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.600]   I want stability for myself and for my family.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.280]   I feel like I haven't taken enough risks in my life and I need to be bolder.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.320]   Yeah, I feel terrible when I've in my life when I've done the wrong thing and it's stuck
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.300]   with me and I hate that feeling and connection.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.740]   It's like what, you know, ultimately what is life about except that do you have people
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.040]   in your life who care about you, whom you care about?
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:38.580]   It's like, yeah, there is an area, a realm of our lives where we absolutely want to maximize
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.760]   and that's it.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.940]   But other stuff just satisfies, you'll be fine.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.540]   So I'll share a minor regret.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.020]   It's not one that's nagging me too much, but I've read a lot of your books and I feel like
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:54.260]   I would have loved to had the chance to start this podcast, I don't know, 15 years ago to
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.740]   be able to go through and have you on every couple of years and talk about them.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.060]   But I can't go back in time.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.020]   So I do want to see if I could pick your brain a little bit.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.020]   Lay it on me.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   There's a lot more with regret.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.020]   And to that, I'll say the book's out.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.580]   Go pick it up and kind of dig into more of the research you've done.
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.620]   But there's two of them, Drive and When, that have some takeaways that I would love to chat
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.620]   about.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.660]   And I'll start with Drive, which was the first book of yours I read.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.780]   And for those who aren't familiar, the subtitle is "The Surprising Truth About What Motivates
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Us."
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.340]   And so I think, despite that I've read it, though it was years ago, I think the first
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.580]   place to start is kind of, maybe you could just share what is that surprising truth for
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.580]   those who aren't familiar.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.420]   I mean, it's that, again, this is a book based on science, based on the work of people like
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.700]   Edward Deasy and Richard Ryan and the late Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and many other people
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.380]   who have researched motivation over the years.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.000]   And what it says is that human beings are complex.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.660]   We have one motivation.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.580]   We have a biological drive.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   We eat when we're hungry.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.660]   We drink when we're thirsty.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.080]   We have sex to satisfy those desires.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.420]   We also respond very well to rewards and punishments in our environment in certain circumstances.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.460]   But we also have another drive.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.380]   We do things because we like them, because they're interesting, because they're meaningful,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.980]   because it's the right thing to do.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:14.580]   I don't think that, especially in organizations, we had a three-dimensional view of people.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.860]   So that's one big idea.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.620]   The other thing is that if you look at 60 years of research in motivational science,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.820]   what it tells you is, I'll give you the one quick conceptual takeaway here of that book,
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.020]   which is this.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.420]   There's a certain kind of motivator we use in organizations.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:34.140]   Psychologists call it a controlling contingent motivator.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.180]   I like to call it an if-then reward, as in, if you do this, then you get that.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.460]   If you do this, then you get that.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.380]   I think it's a simpler way to understand it.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.940]   Here's what science tells us about if—not about all rewards, but about if-then rewards.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.220]   If-then rewards are great for simple tasks with short time horizons.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.380]   They work really well.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.440]   We love rewards.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   They get us to focus.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.580]   So you want someone to stuff a lot of envelopes, pay them per envelope, give them a bonus for
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.340]   every hundred envelopes they stuff.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.780]   For simple tasks where you know exactly what you need to do and you can see the finish
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.620]   line, if-then rewards are effective because human beings love rewards.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:11.140]   But the same body of research tells us that if-then rewards are far less effective for
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.060]   more complex tasks with longer time horizons.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.060]   Why?
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.660]   It's the same reason.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.260]   We love rewards so much, they get us to focus very narrowly.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.580]   That's a good frame of mind if the task is algorithmic.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:28.680]   But if the task requires judgment, creativity, discernment, you don't want to have that
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   narrow focus.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.780]   You want to have an expansive focus.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.260]   And the problem in organizations is that we're using if-then rewards for everything rather
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:40.720]   than for the small and increasingly smaller kind of work that people do.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.280]   And there is a better motivational regime.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.340]   You want to give people some autonomy.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.940]   You want to help them make progress and get better at something that matters.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.940]   You want to plug them into a purpose.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   So you touched on that briefly.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.860]   Then I remember that the kind of three elements are autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.860]   Right.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.700]   Are those things you can create for your own or are they things that organization has to
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   give you?
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.260]   Well, I mean, that's a very profound question actually.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:09.020]   I mean, seriously, I mean that because I think part of the whole field of behavioral science
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.960]   is basically the entire field of social psychology at the very least.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:19.060]   But I think the entire field of behavioral science is when we look at people acting in
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.380]   whatever realm of life, how much of what they're doing is because of the person and how much
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.340]   is it of it because of the situation?
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.180]   You know, it's both, obviously.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.700]   So certain people in certain situations will behave differently from other people in certain
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.700]   situations.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.940]   So I think that for these kinds of principles, you want to work, you want to go to a place,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.140]   an environment that has the nutrients in the soil for these things.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.900]   It's not so much sort of giving you it.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.460]   It's basically creating an atmosphere where those kinds of things can flourish.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.820]   Let's take autonomy, for instance.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.880]   We want to give people some sovereignty over what they do and how they do it and who they
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   do it with.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.940]   So there's some places that just where that soil is not rich enough, where no matter how
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:09.740]   autonomous you might be as an individual, you're not going to be able to drop roots
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:15.340]   in a soil where the whole enterprise is about thwarting autonomy and controlling people.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.740]   So I guess this is a long-winded way, Chris, of my answering that question.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.740]   It depends.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.180]   - So let me rephrase it a different way.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.700]   If you're finding yourself not very motivated to do something, is it safe to say that the
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.860]   first place to start to figure out how to maybe figure out whether you can be motivated,
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.100]   because maybe you just are in a place where it's not possible, is to kind of dig in and
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.980]   explore those three elements and try to figure out if any of them are missing and how to
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980]   create them?
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   - Yeah.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   I think that's a very, very good idea.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.240]   So the question is, so ask yourself, do I have control?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.960]   How much control do I have over what I do, how I do it, when I do it, who I do it with?
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.220]   If you come to that conclusion and say, you know what, I don't have much control over
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.740]   any of those things, that often is a very early warning sign of why you're demotivated.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.180]   Now let me give you another one, because I can deliver a hack here, one of my favorite
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.580]   ones, a practice of my own.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:10.820]   When we think about mastery, the second element, mastery is our desire to get better at stuff.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.820]   And at some level, it's also about our desire to make progress.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.700]   Teresa Mabule at Harvard Business School has some brilliant research showing that the single
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:24.460]   biggest day-to-day motivator on the job is making progress in meaningful work.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.020]   But here's the thing.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.060]   We need information and feedback to know whether we're making progress.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.420]   That's true for anything, right?
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.300]   So if you're driving somewhere, you need to know how fast you're going.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.440]   You need to have the directions and the road signs and the GPS and whatnot.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:48.060]   And for many people, especially in the workplace, they're in a world devoid of information about
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.460]   how they're doing.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.100]   So now to the hack.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.280]   One of my favorite things, and I have this on my laptop on which I'm talking to you,
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.620]   is what I call a progress ritual.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:06.320]   At the end of every day, I stop and list what I got done that day.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:13.380]   It takes me 60 seconds, but I don't leave my office without doing that, because it helps
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.340]   me see the progress that I'm making.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.900]   And we know from the research that making progress is the single largest day-to-day
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   motivator.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.460]   So I have a giant list that just says basically a got done list, a progress list.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.700]   I call it a got done list, but it's really a progress list.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.740]   And so what I'll do is on the day that I'm talking to you, I will go to that list and
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.660]   I will type in everything that I got done today.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:42.620]   And all of us know at some level how intuitively appealing this is, because many of us have
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:47.580]   done the thing where we have a to-do list, write it all out or type it all out.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.180]   Then we do something that's not on the to-do list, and we write it on the to-do list and
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.000]   cross it out, because we know how satisfying that is.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.820]   And so this progress ritual, 60-second punctuation mark at the end of every day, to me is one
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.780]   of the most important things that you can do to maintain your daily motivation.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.220]   And just to get super tactical, where do you put that list?
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.260]   I keep it literally on a Word file.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.860]   I never go back to it.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.260]   That's the thing that's interesting about it.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.780]   It's not for capture to review things.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.780]   It's for the moment.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.100]   It's for that punctuation mark, the ritual in that moment.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.180]   And what I've found is that on some of the most frustrating days that I have, if I take
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:34.140]   that punctuation mark for 60 seconds, I realize I've actually made some progress that day.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:38.280]   That buoys my motivation and it allows me to come back the next day.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.180]   But I almost never look back on it.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.620]   It's the ritual itself that is powerful.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   I love that.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.900]   I've even applied something similar to my life, which is I need to make sure I do something
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:53.020]   exciting and memorable every month to just kind of keep up the progress of non-professional
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.020]   things.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:59.060]   I think it's so easy to spend your days with making all the progress in life on work and
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.780]   forgetting that there's all of these other elements in life that you probably want to
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:03.780]   make progress on.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.020]   But for some reason, for many of us, work is the one we focus on all the time.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.460]   But it's a great point, Chris, because on my list, I put non-work things.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.460]   I'll put, you know, ran four miles.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.100]   I'll put had a phone call with my daughter.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:21.180]   You know, I will put those kinds of things on there because that's a very important part
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.180]   of making progress.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.140]   It's not only the work stuff.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.260]   And how long is the list usually?
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.300]   Is it a couple of things or do you try to get pretty granular?
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.740]   It could be 10, 15, 20 things.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.660]   It depends on the day, you know?
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:36.420]   Like there's not, sometimes a long list is less, there's less progress because I'm doing
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.900]   a bunch of different small things.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.780]   Other days, if I say I wrote a thousand good words, that's a fricking awesome day, even
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.140]   if that's the only line item on there, you know?
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.220]   So it really, it really varies.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.380]   But again, the key thing here, and I really want to emphasize, is that it is the act itself
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.260]   that is valuable.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.380]   Simply doing it is important.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.820]   You can always have it be an ephemeral list and get most of the value.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.980]   If it was written in invisible ink or like it self-destructed after seven days, or if
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.740]   somebody, you know, if somehow Dropbox had some kind of calamity and it disappeared,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:09.740]   I would be fine.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.100]   There's a lot of stuff I wouldn't be fine about if all the Dropbox files disappeared.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.700]   No, that's what I'm saying, because I have, if Dropbox goes down, my life, it's over for
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:18.700]   me.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.540]   I mean, I might as, I basically, if Dropbox goes down, I just go into a monastery for
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.900]   the rest of my life.
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.100]   Any other motivation hacks to get on?
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.460]   We can go to general stuff at the end, but just before we move on.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:35.540]   I mean, one of the things that I like to do for motivating yourself and also for motivating
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:42.100]   other people is each week I try to have two fewer conversations about how and two more
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:48.140]   about why, particularly when I'm working with other people and have even a minor directive
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.140]   role.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.660]   You know, it's like, here's how I want you to do that piece of the website.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.380]   Here's how I want us to do that presentation.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.220]   And just twice a week, you realize when you're working with people and you're in any kind
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.340]   of instructive mode, you have more how conversations than you realize.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.980]   And what I have found is that just converting two of them a week to a why conversation is
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   important.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:13.620]   So catch yourself, say, okay, here's how, stop, here's why we're making that presentation.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.920]   And I find it useful pointed inward as well, especially as a writer.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:24.300]   So there are times when I will, if I'm struggling to write a chapter or struggling to write
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.220]   anything, I naturally want to say, okay, how can I finish this chapter?
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.900]   How can I get this section done?
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:36.500]   And then it's helpful for me to stop back and say, okay, why am I writing this section?
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.460]   Why am I writing this chapter?
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:43.300]   This is not just a couple of times, just both internally and externally, we're a little
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.380]   over-indexed on how conversations and we're a little under-indexed on why conversations.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.420]   And there's a pile of evidence showing that why, that sense of purpose is, I think it's
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.820]   the most cost-effective performance enhancer we have.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.820]   Wow.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.820]   That's a great hack.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.900]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.660]   to your new year routine.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.260]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.420]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.860]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.620]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.460]   So you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.300]   of going out for coffee.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:31.500]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade, sign up for a subscription or
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.220]   try one of their starter packs today.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:38.660]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.380]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this last bag
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:49.900]   of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.100]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:49:00.900]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:10.740]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans, allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:15.620]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.000]   cooking at home?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.340]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.600]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.620]   I'll admit, I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:32.460]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:37.260]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.400]   microwave.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.260]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.200]   the process so much.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.740]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.460]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:00.000]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly recommend
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.760]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.820]   It is so good.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.320]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.040]   have to check it out.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:17.000]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.500]   Again that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.300]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.060]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.980]   Okay, I said I wanted to hit two books.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.780]   So I'm going to move on to when, get some timing, try to make sure we have room for
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.780]   it.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.340]   Which for anyone who hasn't read or seen, it's The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.820]   And I know we've all heard timing is everything, right?
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.420]   I bet that's a common phrase and a lot of us think timing's up to serendipity.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.780]   But my takeaway was it's definitely not something that you should leave to serendipity or let
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.020]   coincidence run.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.580]   Is that a fair takeaway?
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:10.540]   That is, once again, Chris, your concern about fairness is admirable, but it's an essential
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.700]   takeaway.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.980]   The essentialness comes from the fact that timing is not an art, it's a science.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.380]   And for that book written a few years ago, I went back and looked at, I mean, we looked
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:26.100]   at like, I don't know, 700, 800 studies across a whole array of different fields about timing.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.100]   And what it shows is that our brain power changes over the course of a day.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.940]   So we perform differently on different kinds of tasks based on the time of day.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:39.140]   It shows that we have, I think, very seriously undervalued taking breaks, and even the way
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.220]   we think about breaks is distorted.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.860]   But it also shows, even on episodic timing, that, you know, how do beginnings affect us,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.540]   how do midpoints affect us, how do endings affect us, how do groups synchronize in time?
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:57.740]   So a lot of really, really interesting stuff that makes us more aware of the temporal aspects
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.740]   of our lives.
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.540]   And once we're more aware, we can be more intentional.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:06.860]   We tend to be very intentional about what we do, who we do it with, but we're less intentional
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.180]   about when we do things.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:13.020]   And there's a pile of evidence showing that when we do things, it has a material effect
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.460]   on our performance and our happiness.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.820]   - I don't wanna go through the whole book 'cause that'd take a lot of time, and there's
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:18.820]   a book for people to read.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:24.500]   But if we went one layer deeper there, like, when should people do things, or does it matter
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.940]   depending on the type of person?
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   - Let's talk about that.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.700]   Well, it does matter depending on the type of person.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.700]   So let's just talk about daily timing, okay?
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.980]   And the day is a pretty fundamental unit of time because we can't do anything about it.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.900]   You know, we're on a planet, the planet's turning, like, you know, we could say, like,
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.500]   a week is not a real thing.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.400]   We could just declare a week as nine days.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.200]   A week is a human invention.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.140]   We could have say, a week is 13, I hereby declare, as president of the world, a week
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.380]   is 13 days.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.380]   Fine.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.060]   You just can't declare, oh, a day is only gonna be 14 hours.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.620]   Nope, not gonna work.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.400]   So daily timing is really important.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   Here's what we know.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.420]   The most important thing is that our cognitive abilities change over the course of the day.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.420]   They are not static.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.060]   And this is the big mistake that we often make.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.260]   We think that all times of the day are created equal.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.260]   They're not.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.900]   Our brain power changes over the course of the day.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.220]   It changes in material ways, and the best time to do something depends on what you're
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.220]   doing.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:22.140]   So this can't quite get to the level of, like, particular hack, but it can get to the level
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.480]   of design principles.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.940]   And I think that a lot of the actual particular hacks in this realm are wrong.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.460]   They're not scientific.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.900]   So here's what we know.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.860]   You have to begin with what's called a chronotype, and that is essentially your propensity.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.540]   Do you wake up early and go to sleep early?
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.100]   Do you wake up late and go to sleep late?
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.600]   Are you somewhere in between?
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.500]   And what the distribution tells us is that about 15% of us are very strong morning people,
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:50.420]   20% of us are very strong evening people, night owls, and about two-thirds of us are
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:54.340]   in the middle, but we tilt a little bit more toward the morning.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.860]   An overly simplified way of thinking about this is you have night owls and everybody
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.860]   else.
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:00.860]   20% of us are night owls.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.060]   We naturally wake up late and go to sleep late.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.340]   80% of us are a little bit more the other way.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:11.220]   And what it shows us is that the research tells us we move through the day in three
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   stages.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   There's a peak.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.220]   There's a trough.
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   There's a recovery.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:19.140]   The peak for most of us, 80% of us, is early in the day.
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.980]   That's when we're most vigilant.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.500]   We're able to bat away distractions.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.920]   So that's when we should be doing our heads-down analytic work.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.180]   The trough, early to mid-afternoon.
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.300]   That is a terrible time of day.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.460]   We joke about it, but the data are overwhelming.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.300]   Like don't go to the hospital in the afternoon.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:41.060]   There are more per capita car accidents between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. than at any time except
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   for between 4 a.m. and 6 p.m.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:48.540]   I mean, there's a downdraft in performance in that early to mid-afternoon that is staggering.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.740]   So we all have that trough.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:55.580]   We should be doing our administrative work in that period, the work that doesn't require
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.300]   a massive cognitive load.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:02.840]   Now the final stage, peak, early, trough in the middle, recovery later in the day.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.780]   In the recovery phase of the day, it's very interesting.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:11.020]   Our vigilance, our mental vigilance is down, but our mood is typically up.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:15.700]   And that can be a very potent combination for doing things like brainstorming or solving
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.660]   non-obvious problems or iterating ideas.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:24.860]   And so for 80% of us, we should be doing our heads-down analytic work during the peak,
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.020]   which is most usually early in the day.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.300]   We should be doing the least important stuff for those couple of hours in the middle of
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:36.420]   the day, and then we should be doing our insight, iterative, brainstorming kind of stuff later
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   in the day.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.140]   Now, the one caveat here is that if you're part of the 20% who are night owls, you're
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.660]   much better off doing your analytic work late in the day, because that's when you are most
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   vigilant.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:53.200]   And so one of the things that we see is that the traditional corporate structures are completely
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.820]   inhospitable to people who are night owls.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.900]   They want people to be at like 7 a.m. staff or 8 a.m. staff meetings when these people
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:07.180]   are barely conscious at that time, but they're on fire at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.020]   Do you think the trend towards kind of remote work and multiple time zones kind of makes
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.540]   it better for these night owls?
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.900]   Yeah, I do.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.700]   I think that remote work is a godsend to night owls.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.140]   Not only remote, but also, again, autonomous work.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.860]   Going back to Drive for a second.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.740]   Autonomous work is great, because you want to give people some amount of control over
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.980]   what they do, how they do it, but also when they do it.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:38.340]   And so, at some level, managers should be focused on results, not on whether Chris is
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:42.220]   at the Zoom meeting at 8.30 in the morning.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:48.140]   If Chris is doing high-quality work and he's more comfortable doing it between 9 p.m. and
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:53.100]   2 in the morning, I don't care if he's not on that 8.30 Zoom call, because he's delivering
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.100]   results.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:57:00.460]   What I would do as a manager is default to autonomy to let people find the way of work
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.860]   that is best for them and that contributes to the larger whole.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.380]   Now, I know you said 80% of people should be doing that analytical work in the morning.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.100]   And if I remember right, one of the takeaways was that you hate breakfast.
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.100]   Is that...
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.100]   Oh, no, no.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.100]   I don't hate breakfast.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.100]   I don't hate breakfast.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.100]   No, I don't hate breakfast at all.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.500]   It's like, you know, I sort of see things a little bit like an economist, as like pricing.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.580]   And so, I think that breakfast is over...
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.300]   The evidence that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is almost non-existent.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.300]   I mean, breakfast isn't bad.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   I eat breakfast.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.300]   It's not bad.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:35.980]   The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is really a legacy of breakfast
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:40.180]   cereal advertising from the early part of the 20th century, truly.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.500]   But I actually think that in some ways, breakfast is overvalued and lunch is undervalued.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.540]   Lunch as a punctuation mark in the middle of the day, lunch as a break in the middle
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.020]   of the day, I think is undervalued.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.300]   And I think that breaks in general are undervalued.
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.300]   We have this...
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:58:00.780]   Even the many of us who have zero connection to the family connection to the Puritans have
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:07.300]   absorbed this very Puritanical view that the way to get work done, more work done, better
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.420]   work done, is to power through all the time.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.980]   And also, this idea that powering through is morally virtuous.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.560]   That's not what the evidence tells us about high performers.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.580]   The evidence on high performers in music, in sports, in so many realms shows that they
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.780]   are systematic break takers.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.340]   They treat their breaks very seriously and so should the rest of us.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:31.220]   - Is there a kind of general principle or a hack for, here's how many breaks you should
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.820]   be taking or how often or what types?
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:38.240]   - So here's the thing, if we're gonna follow the science, we have design principles.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.420]   This is why I go crazy where the advice is like, "Wake up at 4.30 in the morning and
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.620]   win the day."
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.620]   You know what?
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.620]   A lot of us don't do that.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:50.980]   A lot of us, our brains and physiology are not built for that, I'm sorry.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:55.180]   I don't think that there is a certain number of breaks to take in the day.
[00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:00.960]   However, there are design principles very clearly rooted in the science about the kinds
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.460]   of breaks that you should take.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:06.220]   So one principle is that something is better than nothing.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.140]   So even a short break is better than no break at all.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.740]   Two, outside is better than inside.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:16.860]   I think, again, one of the things we haven't fully reckoned with is the importance of being
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:20.380]   exposed to nature and being in nature, even in urban environments.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.300]   There's a whole pile of research on this as well.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.900]   So outside is better than inside.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.140]   Moving is better than stationary.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:30.260]   A break where you're in motion is better than a break where you're sedentary.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.020]   Social is better than solo.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:37.180]   So breaks with other people are more restorative than breaks on our own, even for introverts.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.300]   And finally, last and certainly not least, you gotta be fully detached.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.860]   So a break where you're walking around with your face in your phone is not a break.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.260]   You gotta be fully detached.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:52.900]   So I've always thought that you wanna sort of a meta change the country and increase
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:59.960]   labor productivity by 0.6% in a year hack, which would be an incredible accomplishment,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:06.620]   is that if everybody in the American workforce took a 15-minute walk every afternoon, took
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.260]   a 15-minute walk outside with someone they liked, talking about something other than
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.140]   work and leaving their phones behind.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.860]   I think that would be how we are at a market increase in productivity and also mental and
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.860]   emotional well-being.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.500]   - Well, I can't change the entire country.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.540]   Talk about something, an easy hack, right?
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.540]   - Totally.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.540]   - It costs nothing.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   - Totally.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   - And adds a lot of value.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.700]   - And the hack would be, since most of the people who listen to a podcast about hacks
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:38.260]   are not gonna do it sort of impulsively, just put it in your schedule, set it for a week.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.020]   You know, 2.15 every afternoon, I'm gonna take a 15-minute walk break with someone I
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.060]   like outside, talking about something other than work and not bringing my phone with me.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:51.420]   And I actually think, Chris, that if in organizations, if managers, if the leaders of these organizations
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.260]   start doing this, then that actually could be a game changer.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.500]   - I mean, could everyone just do it at the same time?
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.300]   Would it be like the bell, you know, rings, the production line stops?
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.160]   - Well, you're making a very interesting point there, right?
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:09.540]   Because if you think about these design elements, outside, in motion, detached, with people
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.420]   you like, that's basically recess.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:16.340]   So, you know, I have long advocated that we should have, you know, maybe we do it en masse.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.900]   We have a 2.30 every day, we have the Great American Walk Break.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.900]   - Or recess, can we just call it recess and bring back the childhood spirits?
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.380]   - We can call it the American Adult Recess Initiative.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:32.740]   - Ari, no, that doesn't quite work there, the Adult Recess Initiative, Ari, Ari, no,
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.740]   yeah.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740]   - We can work on it.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   - Yeah.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.140]   - So this is all for the day, right?
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.500]   You talked a little bit about how to schedule this for the week.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.180]   Did you learn anything about timing?
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.540]   You know, I know you said weeks, months, years, they're all kind of concepts that we made
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.180]   up, but is there something important to good timing over longer periods of time?
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.980]   - Well, yes and no.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.820]   I mean, I think to me, the most important piece of research there is by Katie Milkman,
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.420]   Jason Rees, and Hengchen Dai, who did something where they discovered what they call the Fresh
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:07.380]   Start Effect, which is that certain days in the calendar operate as temporal landmarks.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:12.740]   That is, they stick out in the calendar, they stick out in time the way that physical landmarks
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.340]   stick out in space, and they give us a way to orient ourselves, and there's certain kinds
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:22.180]   of temporal landmarks that are these, that they call these fresh start dates, that where
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:27.740]   we essentially relegate our past, our bad selves to the past, and open up kind of a
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.060]   fresh ledger on our new selves.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:36.780]   So they found, for instance, that in college, okay, so they looked at a large university
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.740]   where students are swiping in and out of the gym.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.420]   Winter students going to the gym, so it's a brilliant study because you can get data
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.180]   on students taking their ID, swiping into the gym and not.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:52.340]   Students more likely to go to the gym on the first day of the semester, on Mondays,
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.020]   on the day after a holiday.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:59.060]   And so there's certain days of the year where we are more likely to begin behavior change
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.860]   and therefore more likely to continue with that behavior change, and those are the fresh
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.860]   start dates.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.820]   First of the month, beginning of a semester, first day of a quarter, the day after a federal
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.780]   holiday, that kind of stuff.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.580]   - What about making big decisions?
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:18.020]   I'm gonna switch my career, quit my job, or something like that.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.180]   Any science to timing those?
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.060]   - Those big decisions accumulate.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:29.020]   And so it's not the kind of thing where people decide right away, in terms of a given day.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:36.180]   There is some evidence showing that we are more likely to resort to a kind of default
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.540]   no later in the day than earlier in the day.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.380]   If you're going back to a boldness regret and you want to ask out someone who you're
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.980]   interested in, if you wait until later in the day, there's some evidence that you're
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.980]   gonna just give up.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:56.020]   Whereas if you do it early in the day, you might be able to summon a little bit more
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.020]   moxie.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.860]   - Well, there's plenty more in the book and we didn't even hit on four or five other books.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.860]   So lots to check out, lots of links in the show notes.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.820]   Before we go, you mentioned you had some hacks that span outside of these books.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.180]   There's some boxes in the corner you referenced.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.460]   I'd love to hear some of the general things that you do or recommend to kind of optimize
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.100]   life and everything else.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.980]   - Well, I mean, I do a lot of different things.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:25.660]   So you're seeing in my office here, my garage behind my house in Washington, DC, I have
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.660]   these box.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.460]   These are banker's boxes that you sometimes will see in a law firm in the 1980s.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.580]   I love them.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:37.520]   And what I do is that when I have projects that I'm not working on right now, the projects
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.500]   that I'm imagining for the future, some of which may go somewhere, some of which may
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.460]   not, what I will do is I will establish a physical box for each of those things.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.940]   And then when I see something, a newspaper article, or I hear about a book, I heard about
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.540]   a book today, somebody mentioned a book that was related to something here.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.900]   So when I get the book, I'm not going to read that book right now, but I'm going to take
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:04.260]   that book, plop it in that box, because that way is a way for me to collect all the material
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:09.340]   that I think might be relevant to that particular project, but that I'm not ready to deal with
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.340]   right now.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:16.260]   So these boxes for me are an incredible organizing tool, even though it's very analog.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:22.260]   I still use, I use Evernote sometimes, I still use Dropbox, but for me, the physical boxes
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.940]   are so useful.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:29.100]   I see a magazine story or I see something online, I print it out, pop it in the box.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.940]   I get a book, pop it in the box.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.940]   And what happens then is, to my surprise, it's like a holiday morning.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:41.300]   It's like, "Oh, well, I was thinking about working on that, make a documentary about
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300]   X, Y, or Z."
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:46.060]   And then I look at the box, it's like, "Holy moly, who put all this stuff in here?
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.060]   This is great.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.500]   I got all kinds of research material right here."
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.340]   If I didn't have a system for that, I would be lost.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:58.180]   And so for me, having various kinds of systems to capture ideas is super useful.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.740]   I also use something called a Spark file.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.540]   I don't even know where this even came from, which again, it's just a running document
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.620]   that I store in Dropbox.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.060]   And let's say that I have a question.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:13.540]   Let's say that I have an idea, I think of a phrase, "Hey, that would be a good book
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.540]   title."
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.660]   I just pop it on that Spark file.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:21.260]   And periodically, we go back to that maybe every three or four months to see what's on
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   there.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.260]   It's a long list of things.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.380]   So it could be a question.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.220]   Maybe I say, "Oh, wow, our left-hander is more likely to be libertarians."
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.020]   I've noticed a lot of left-handers are libertarians.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.020]   Is that a thing?
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.140]   And I don't feel like researching that right now.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.820]   It's kind of an intriguing question.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.900]   It's not that urgent and essential in my life at this moment, but it's kind of intriguing.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:45.220]   Put it on the Spark file, out of my head, into a system.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.740]   Or even things like I'll think of a book title.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.380]   And I don't even know what the book is, but put it on there.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.380]   And I go through it.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.460]   And a lot of this stuff, when I look at it later on, it's like, "Okay, this is not that
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.460]   interesting."
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.460]   But some stuff sticks.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   So again, having systems, getting stuff out of...
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.540]   I'm a big believer in the getting things done methodology of David Allen from 30, 25 years
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.540]   ago.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.940]   I still am a devotee of that.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:14.060]   But basically, devotee especially of the core principle, which is get it out of your head
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.340]   into a system.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.500]   Don't rely on keeping things in your head.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.340]   Use your head for the things that you really need your head for, which is problem-solving
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.660]   and creation, not for storage.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   Two things I've used.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.900]   One is a Chrome extension called OneTab.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.660]   And sometimes I'll just be researching something.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.780]   I have all these tabs open.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.460]   I'm like, "I don't have time for this."
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.940]   Click one button, all the tabs disappear.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.460]   You can always go back and find them grouped by whenever you click the button.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:44.580]   And what I'll say is, it's kind of like a graveyard of things that actually didn't matter.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.580]   I go back there.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.460]   I'm like, "Gosh, why did I go down a rabbit hole here?
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.460]   I don't even care."
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.460]   Right.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.460]   And there's this great "Delete this.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]   I never need it."
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.660]   And then the other is whenever I find links that someone shared, posted on Twitter, and
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.660]   I'm like, "Oh, I want to read that."
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.660]   I just send it to...
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.940]   I think I send it to Reminders on my iPhone.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.500]   And I'm like, "One day, I can go back and scroll through that."
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.260]   And oftentimes, I don't.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.580]   But at least it gives me the satisfaction of I acknowledge the link without having to
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.580]   read it now.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   Interesting.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.580]   I don't feel...
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.740]   To go back full circle, I don't feel the regret of not clicking.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:19.180]   I can eliminate the regret of not looking at it by saving it for later, but not actually
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.180]   looking at it.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.500]   Out of your head into a system.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.100]   I use something similar to that.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.580]   I've been using it for a long time.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.140]   And I think what happens sometimes...
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.900]   It's called Instapaper, which is simply a...
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.700]   There are extensions or buttons on, I think, every browser now where you see an article
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:35.860]   online.
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.260]   Let's say it's a long-form article.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.260]   It's 3,000 words.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.540]   I'm not going to sit there in the midst of a maw of a day and read a 3,000-word article
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.740]   on my computer.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.420]   But if I hit the Instapaper button, it saves it.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.140]   And then I go on my iPad and read the stories like that.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140]   I love Instapaper.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.140]   That's great.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.140]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.020]   There's another app called Pocket, which I think is kind of the same thing.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.020]   Same thing.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020]   It's...
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.020]   Pocket is...
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.020]   The only...
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.900]   It's like I use Instapaper because I started using Instapaper.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.900]   If I started using Pocket, I'd be using Pocket.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.620]   But it's the same basic principle.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.660]   Any other final hacks?
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.900]   I got so many, man.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:15.460]   So one of the smartest things I've done is I keep a notebook next to my bed, and it's
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.900]   called a line-a-day notebook.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:23.300]   And every day, I write down one line that I've heard, a sentence, a phrase, a question,
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.940]   a quotation that I've heard.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.140]   And I usually capture them on my phone.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.580]   I take a photograph of it.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.440]   And then I just render it, but actually with a pen, in this book.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.120]   And so I've done this every...
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.500]   This book now, I'm on year four.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.940]   So every day for three-plus years.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.340]   So there's way over 1,000 little entries in there.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   Wow.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   And what do you do with them?
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.700]   I go back and look at them.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.180]   Sometimes I write down jokes.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.860]   And so it allows me to remember jokes that I wouldn't have remembered before.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.780]   Other times, I'll write down a sentence that I read that's really intriguing, that just
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.780]   helps me think through.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.000]   It's like, "Oh, why does that sentence work so well?"
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.820]   But again, I have to say the habit of it on that one is also really important.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:08.740]   Because what it does, more than anything else, it makes me pay attention in the day, makes
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.580]   me attuned to hearing and seeing great things.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.900]   Because you know you're going to need to write one down.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.220]   Because I know I'm going to write something down, yeah.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.220]   I like that a lot.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.140]   I feel like it's very easy to get distracted throughout the day and not pay attention.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.340]   But if you have a goal at the end of the day of, "I'm going to write one thing down," you've
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:24.340]   got to find that thing.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   Right.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.980]   And when you find that thing, you just take a picture of it or I sometimes will send myself
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   an email.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.980]   Here's today's.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:32.500]   So the story in the Washington Post that I read, it happened to be about the NFL.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.720]   There's a very good sports writer for the Washington Post named Adam Kilgore.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.580]   And he was writing about the NFL.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:44.460]   And he had a couple of lines about football and the NFL that I just thought was just brilliant
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   writing.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:48.700]   And I literally took a photograph of it.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.540]   And tonight, I'll transcribe that into my little notebook.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.000]   The book, we talked about "Regret" a lot at the beginning.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.820]   The book's out today.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:00.060]   Other than buying the book and reading it and enjoying it, where can people follow you
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.060]   online?
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.660]   Well, you can go to my website, which is danpink.com.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.380]   And there's all kinds of groovy stuff there.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:12.500]   And you can find the books, as they say, wherever books are sold.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   A lot of research reports.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.020]   We'll link up to all of them in the show notes, as well as the book.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.020]   Cool.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.020]   Thanks for doing that.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.020]   I appreciate it.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.420]   I just hope that Manu Ginobili listens to this.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:23.420]   I will.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   He was the one that sent me a list.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:27.060]   He's like, "Hey, if you could have a couple of these people on," and he had your name
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.060]   on there.
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.060]   I was like, "Okay.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060]   I got to reach out.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.060]   I should have reached out."
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.060]   Oh, really?
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.060]   Really?
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.380]   Because actually, I got some street cred with my son a few years ago when I showed him
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.980]   that Manu Ginobili and Pau Gasol followed me on Twitter.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.980]   Wow.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.080]   So that's pretty good, I have to say.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.040]   That's how the Manu thing started for me, was I noticed he followed me and I sent him
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   a note.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   So he's quite responsive.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Nice.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040]   You should reach out.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   Yeah, I should.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Well, cool.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Chris, what a pleasure being with you.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.000]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.680]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.480]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.720]   I would really appreciate it, especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.120]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.600]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   That's it for this week.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:29.520]   I'll see you next week.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.080]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.900]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:42.240]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.560]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.120]   to save a dollar.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.060]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:57.240]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.800]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:11.360]   your mind, and it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.520]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.160]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.920]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.560]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.420]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.560]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.000]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.920]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
