[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the book of Exodus in chapter 33, reading from verse 12 to verse 17.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   The book of Exodus, chapter 33, verses 12 to 17.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people, and thou wast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou wast also found grace in my sight.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Now therefore I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight, and consider that this nation is thy people.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   For wherein shall it be known here, that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We come back once more to a study of this particular section of this great 33rd chapter of the book of Exodus.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Those who attend here regularly will know that we are studying this chapter and have been doing so for the last five Sunday mornings.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But we come back, I say, again to this particular section, which I have ventured to say is in many ways the crucial section in this entire incident.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Now let me remind you again that we are studying the chapter at all because we are looking into the whole question of revival.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We are starting from this assumption that the only hope for the Christian church at the present time is a mighty outpouring of God's Spirit.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Such as God gave graciously a hundred years ago in the United States of America, in Northern Ireland, in Wales, and in Scotland, and in other places.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   There are many members of the Christian church this year who are looking back at and commemorating that great visitation of God's Spirit in 1859.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And we are taking advantage of this occasion to consider together in the light of the teaching of the scripture this whole vital matter of revival.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And here we feel is a very great illustration of how we should approach the entire subject.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I will not again repeat the background. Let me just remind you of the introduction as it were to this particular section we are looking at at the moment.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   God having punished these people and having brought them to repentance, Moses, you remember, set up that tent of meeting outside the camp.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And he and others would go there and would plead with God for further mercy and for further manifestations of his grace.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And God met Moses and spoke to him as a man speaks to his friend face to face.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   But Moses, you remember, was not satisfied with that. He went back again into this tabernacle, this tent, this place of meeting with God.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And there we have looked at him already as described in this section, verses 12 to 17, we have looked at him presenting further petitions to God.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And I would remind you that we have seen that he has asked particularly for a personal assurance as far as he himself was concerned.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He has also asked for power, power for himself and for the people.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And he has asked for some exceptional, unusual authentication of the church and her message.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   "How shall these people know," he says, "here in this wilderness that we are thy people?"
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   He is not content with the usual blessings. If one may use such a term, he is not content with the ordinary experience of the church.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He feels that he and the children of Israel are in such a situation that they have a right to ask for some special authentication.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The situation is so grievous and so urgent, he asks for this special declaration of the fact from God that they are indeed his people.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Very well, we take up therefore at that particular point. Those are the things for which Moses prayed.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And now we go on to consider another question, which is this. Why Moses prayed for them?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   If those are the things for which he prayed, well, why did he do so? What were his motives?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Surely there is nothing that is more important for us than this.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Because if I understand the situation at all, it is in this realm of purpose and of motives that we so constantly go wrong.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We start at the wrong end. And therefore we will derive great benefit and instruction as we watch Moses praying here.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And of course what is true of him at this point, you will find, is true of God's intercessors, God's saints as they plead with God,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   as you find them everywhere else in the scripture.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And again I would remind you of this, that if you read the history of the great revivals of the past,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   you will find that as you watch the men whom God has used most signally in the period before the revival came,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   when they were praying and pleading and interceding, you will find that they always were animated by exactly the same motives
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   as we find here in the case of Moses, and always, as I say, in the case of God's servants.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So we must be perfectly clear with regard to this matter of our motives.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I am calling you to pray for revival. Yes, but why should you pray for revival? Why should anybody pray for revival?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And the answer that is first given here is this, a concern for the glory of God.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's the first thing that I find here. You'll find it at the end of verse 13.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   "Now therefore I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know that I may find grace in thy sight.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And consider that this nation is thy people." That's the motive, that's the reason.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Moses was concerned primarily about the glory of God.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Now, frequently you read these chapters, the surrounding chapters in the book of Exodus and elsewhere,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   you will find that Moses constantly used this particular argument with God.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Let me give an illustration from the previous chapter, 32. You will find it in verses 11 and 12.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   God was angry with these children of Israel because they had made this golden calf and so on, and had rebelled against him.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And God said then to Moses, in verse 9 I'm reading, "I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, that I may consume them, and I will make of thee a great nation."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And Moses besought the Lord his God and said, "Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   which thou, thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt, with great power and with a mighty hand?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say, 'For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth'?"
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Now you see Moses' concern. He's concerned about the name and as it were the reputation and the glory of God.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And that's the point he's making here again. This nation, he says, is thy people.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   He's saying in effect that God's honour and God's glory is involved in this situation.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   They are after all his people. They have claimed that. He has given indications of that.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He's brought them out of Egypt in a marvellous and miraculous manner.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   He has brought them through the Red Sea. Is he going to leave them here now in the wilderness?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   What will the Egyptians say? What will the other nations say?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Has he failed? He promised them great things. Can't he execute them? Can't he bring them to fulfilment?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Moses is suggesting to God that his own glory, his own honour is involved in this whole situation.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now as I say, you will find this endlessly in the Psalms. You will find it constantly in the prophets.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Their prayer to God is this, "For thine own name's sake." As if to say, "We have no right to speak,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and we're not really asking it for ourselves, but for thine own name's sake. For thy glory's sake.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   For the sake of thine eternal honour."
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Moses had a concern thus, for and was jealous about the name and the glory of God.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And he's asking God for his own sake to do this extra, this special thing.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well now my friends, we can't stop with all these points as I'd like to.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But this is the thing that matters, isn't it? The church after all is the church of God.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   She is his new creation by water and the Word.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   We are a people for God's own peculiar possession.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And why has he called us out of darkness into his own marvellous light?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Well it is that we may show forth his praises, his excellences, his virtues.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And therefore I say we should be concerned about this matter primarily because
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   of the name and the glory and the honour, the reputation of God himself.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Whether we like it or not, it is the fact you know, that the world judges God himself
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   and the Lord Jesus Christ by what it sees in us.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   We are his representatives. We are the people who take his name upon us.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We are the people who talk about him.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And the man outside the church regards the church as the representative of God.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And there is no question about it but that people are judging God and Christ
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   and the whole of the Christian faith by what it sees in us because of the claims that we make.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And therefore I am arguing that we must emulate the example of Moses as we find it here.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Our first concern should be about the glory of God.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But am I being unfair? I wonder when I suggest that one notices that that is scarcely ever mentioned.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   There is great concern about the church today of course, but what's the concern about?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   The concern is about statistics and figures.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   People are talking about churches being empty and people are talking about means and methods
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   of trying to fill them again and get the people in.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They are interested in the figures and in membership, in finance and organisation.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   How often do you hear your annual conferences and assemblies expressing a concern
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   about the glory of God and the honour of the name of God?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   No, no, our attitude seems to be rather that the church is a human organisation.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And of course we are concerned about what's happening to it as a man is concerned
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   if his business isn't going well and if it isn't paying.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   We are businessmen and we are concerned about the institution and the organisation.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But Moses wasn't primarily.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   His first and chief concern was about the glory of God.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Are you grieved at the state of the church?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Well, why are you grieved at the state of the church?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Is it because you are old enough to remember the end of the Victorian era
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   or the Edwardian period when it was the custom for people to crowd into churches?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Or is it just a sort of nostalgia for the great days of the church?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Or do we know something of a concern for the name of God?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Are we pained? Are we hurt? Are we grieved?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Does it weigh heavily upon our hearts and minds and spirits
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   when we see the godlessness that surrounds us and the name of God taken in vain?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Do we know something for this zeal, this holy zeal?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Can we say my heart is pained within me as I see the scoffing?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Because God's name is involved.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   You notice the concern of the psalmist in Psalm 79?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   He says, "Wherefore should the heathen say, 'Where is their God?'"
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   That's what they're saying.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   They're laughing and they're saying, "They talked about some great God
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   who was the God above every other God.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   They said the God of Israel is the God.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   They gloried in him. They said he was wonderful.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Where is he?" Look at them.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   How can such people claim that they're in the hands of such a God?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They'd never be in such a condition if that were really true.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   You see what is involved primarily is the glory and the honor and the name of God.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It isn't our institutions. It isn't our success or failure that matters.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   The primary thing is this.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Of course, the psalmist sees it. Take the second psalmer.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Well, he puts it, "The kings of the earth set themselves," he says,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   "and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying"
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Of course, they were attacking David.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   They were attacking the children of Israel.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   But David has the insight. He was a spiritually minded man.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   He says, "It isn't against me. It's against God.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's against the Lord and his anointed that these people are setting themselves
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   and the heathen are imagining a vain thing."
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Indeed, this is the great theme that you'll find running everywhere through the psalms.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Let me give you just one other instance of it in Psalm 83.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   "For lo, says the psalmist, thine enemies make a tumult,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   They have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones."
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yes, but it's all against God.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And then there is that marvelous and almost lyrical example of it
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   You remember in chapter 4.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Peter and John having been tried and having been prohibited to preach the gospel anymore,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   great threat given to the church,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   the authorities were determined to exterminate the church and to put an end to her preaching.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   They went back and they began to pray with all the assembled company.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   This is what they said.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   "The kings of the earth," they're quoting the second psalm,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   "the kings of the earth stood up,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Then their own words, "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and the people of Israel were gathered together,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And now, Lord, behold their threatenings."
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   You see, they had a clear insight.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   You would have thought that they would have prayed entirely about themselves,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   but they didn't primarily.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They recognized that all that is happening is really against God.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And here, my dear friends, is the thing surely that we must need to recapture.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   We are so subjective in our approach, always thinking about ourselves,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   but that's not the way to pray for revival.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   We must, I say, be primarily concerned about God,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   his glory, his honor, his name.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Very well, I say, I leave it at that,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   but it's the essence of the whole matter.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   If you go through the great prayers of the Old Testament,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and you'll find it's always there,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   these men had a passion for God.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   They were in trouble, I say, they were unhappy,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   because this great God was not being worshipped as he should be.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And they prayed God for his own sake, for his glory's sake,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   to vindicate his own name and to arise and to scatter his enemies.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Well, then they come to the second thing, of course,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   which is, and it comes in the second place, but never in the first,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   a concern about the honor of the church herself.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Incidentally, in this particular passage,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   there is nothing more wonderful than the way in which Moses
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   shows his concern for the church, which was then the children of Israel.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   God had been giving Moses some wonderful intimations of his loving interest in him.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Moses isn't content with that.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Moses doesn't merely seek personal blessings.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   He wants to make sure that the children of Israel as a whole
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   are going to be involved in this blessing.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   He is given again a wonderful example of that in the previous chapter in verse 32.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Let me read it to you.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's one of the most glorious things in the Old Testament.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Beginning to read at verse 30 in chapter 32,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   "It came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the people,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Ye have sinned a great sin, and now I will go up unto the Lord;
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And Moses returned unto the Lord and said,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   O this people have sinned a great sin,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and have made them gods of gold.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and then a dash,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   it is as if he broke down and couldn't speak any longer.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He's in a great agony of soul.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and then he's able to speak, if not,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   blot me, I pray, the out of thy book which thou hast written.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I don't want to go on living, he says,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   if you're not going to include them in the blessing.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   God had said, I'm going to blot out this people,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I'm going to make a nation out of you.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   No, says Moses, blot me out as well.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I don't want to go on without them.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Oh, this is true intercession.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   The man is concerned about the state of the whole church.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And his own personal life and welfare and well-being is nothing to him,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   unless the church is to be blessed.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But he's repeating all that.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Thy people, this nation.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Well, I might keep you here for a whole morning,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   but we must go on, we must press on.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   I'm simply putting it like this, my friend.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   It seems to me there's no hope for revival
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   until you and I and all of us have reached the stage
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   in which we begin to forget ourselves a little,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and to be concerned for the church,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   for God's body, people here on earth.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So many of our prayers are subjective and self-centered.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   We've got our problems and difficulties.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And you know by when we're finished with them,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   we are tired and exhausted and we don't pray for the church.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   My blessing, my need, my this, my that,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   it's all right, my dear friend, I'm not being hard and unkind.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   God has promised to deal with them.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   But I ask you, where does the church come in your prayers and intercessions?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Do you go beyond yourself and your family?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   We stand before the world and we say
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   the only hope for the world is Christianity.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   We say the church and the church alone has the message that is needed.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   We see the problems of society.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   They're shouting at us.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   They're increasing week by week.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And we know that this is the only answer.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Well, very well, if we know that and if we believe that,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   let me ask you in the name of God,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   how often do you pray that the church may have power to preach this
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   in such a manner that all these citadels
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   that are raising themselves against God
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   shall be raised to the ground and flattened in his holy presence?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   How much time do you give in praying
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   that the preachers of the gospel may be endued with the power of the Holy Ghost?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Are you interceding about this?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Are you concerned about it?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Moses, I say, was more concerned about this.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   He wouldn't go up alone.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   He didn't want to be made the great man alone.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   No, no, it's the church, he says.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I'm not going on unless they're all coming with me and you are in the midst.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   We must learn to think again about the Christian church.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Our whole approach has become subjective.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   It's subjective in evangelism.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's subjective in the teaching of sanctification.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's subjective from beginning to end.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   We start with ourselves and our own needs and problems.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   God is an agency to supply an answer,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   to give us what we need, and it's all wrong.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Evangelism and everything else must start with God and his glory,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   the God who is over all and to whom all things belong.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   It is because men are not glorifying him that they need to be saved,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   not to have some little personal problem solved.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And if the motive for evangelism is to fill the churches, it's doomed to failure.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Of course, you may fill your churches, but it won't help you, it won't avail you,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   it won't make any difference to the main problem.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   It is, I say, this conception of the church as the people of God
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   who bear his name and who have been brought into being by him.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's this that matters.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   We must cease to think of the church as a gathering of institutions and organizations.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   We must get back this notion that we are the people of God
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   and that for his name's sake and because his name is upon us,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   we must plead for the church, yes, and for her glory and her honor,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   because she is his.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And then thirdly, of course, his third reason is this.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   He is concerned about these heathen that are outside. He wants them to know.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "Wherein shall it be known here," here means in the wilderness where we are,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Is it not in that thou goest with us?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   So shall we be separated from the people, I and thy people,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   from all the people that are upon the face of the earth."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   These are the motives in praying for revival.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Yes, for the name and honor and glory of God,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   for the sake of the church which is his.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Yes, and for the sake of those people that are outside,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   that are scoffing and mocking and jeering and laughing and ridiculing.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Oh God, say these people one after another, arise and silence them.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Do something so that we may be able to say to them,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   "Be still, keep silent, give up, be still and know."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   That I am God.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   That's the prayer.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   They've got their eye on these that are outside.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And so they have, I say, running right through the Bible.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   So have all men who have felt the burden of the condition of the church
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and whose hearts are breaking because they have seen the name of God blasphemed.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Oh, you'll find it in very strong language here sometimes.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   So strong, you know, that certain little people are troubled by the imprecatory psalms.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But the imprecatory psalms are just an expression of the zeal of these men for the glory of God.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   "Let the sinner be consumed from the earth," says the man in Psalm 104.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   "There they are," he says, "spoiling your great creation.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I see the mountains and the valleys and the rivers and the streams.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I see the cedars of God which are full of sap.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   He who thinks of the birds and everything, conspiring together to show the wonder and the glory of God.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But here's the sinner, who in spite of all God's goodness to him,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   still reviles and rebels and blasphemes.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And the man in his righteous indignation and zeal says,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   "Let the sinner be consumed out of the earth."
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But that, I say, is the real explanation of them all.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It wasn't a desire for personal vengeance.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   It was that these men were consumed for this passion for God and his glory and his great name.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And there's something wrong with us, you know.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   If we don't feel this desire within us that God should arise and do something,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   shall shut the mouths and stop the mouths of these arrogant blasphemers of today,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   who speak with their mincing words upon your wireless and your television,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   these supposed philosophers, these godless, arrogant men.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Don't we feel sometimes this desire within us,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   that they might know that God is God and that he is the eternal God?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Ah yes, there is a desire that they may be answered, that they may be silenced,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   but it doesn't stop at that, of course.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Following that comes a desire that they may be convicted, that they may be convinced,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   that they may rarely see it.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   That God should do something so strange, so wonderful,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   that they shall be arrested and apprehended and say, "What is this?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Are these people right after all?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Don't our arguments seem to be falling astray?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   We thought that God had failed. He's left them there in the wilderness.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Everything's going against them."
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Then if God suddenly comes in and does something miraculous and leads them through,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   the heathen will have to think again and say, "Ah, perhaps they were right after all."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And that's the first step in the direction of conviction and conversion.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Interest has been aroused.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And you see, whenever you get a revival, that always happens.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   People who have scoffed at the name of God have gone to look on in pure curiosity,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and that has often led to their conversion.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Well, Moses is praying for that, that these people may be arrested and apprehended
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   and may develop an interest in the way in which God is leading them and is directing them.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I simply ask therefore hurriedly in passing,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   are you concerned at all about these people who are outside?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's a terrible state of the church, you know,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   when she just consists of a collection of very nice and respectable people
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   who have no concern for the world,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   who pass it by drawing up their skirts to themselves in their horror
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   at the bestiality and the foulness and the ugliness of it all.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   We not only want the scoffers to be silenced,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   we should desire that these men and women who are like sheep without a shepherd
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   should have their eyes opened,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   should begin to see the cause of their troubles,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   and should be delivered from the chains of iniquity
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   and the shackles of infamy and vice and foulness.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Oh, I ask you as I pass along,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   are you concerned at all about them that are outside?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And are you praying God to do something that they may be influenced and affected?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Well, there as I understand it are the three main motives
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   which animated Moses as he offered up these petitions to God in this section.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Let me hurry on to something else.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I must comment upon the way in which he prayed.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   We've seen what he prayed for, we've seen why he prayed for it.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Let's watch him as regards his method of prayer,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   and if ever we needed instruction it's just here.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Here are the elements that always come out in all the great biblical prayers.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I just give you some headings as I close.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   What are the characteristics of Moses' prayer?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Well, the first is this, isn't it? Boldness, confidence.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   There's no hesitation here.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   There's a quiet confidence.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Oh, let me use the term, there's a holy boldness.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   This is the great characteristic of all prayers that have ever prevailed.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It's a thing of course which is inevitable.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   You cannot pray truly, still less can you intercede.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   If you haven't an assurance of your acceptance,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and if you don't know the way into the holiest of all,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   if when you get down on your knees you're reminded of your sins
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and you're wondering what you can do about them
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and have to spend all your time in praying for forgiveness and pardon
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and wondering whether God is listening or whether he isn't,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   how can you pray? How can you intercede as Moses did here?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   No, no, Moses was face to face with God, he was assured.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   He was bold with a holy boldness.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   God had granted him these intimations of his nearness.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   We've seen that at the end of the previous chapter.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   We've seen it again in this chapter.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   So Moses was able to speak with this confidence and assurance.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And this is absolutely vital to prayer.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Do you know the way into the holiest of all?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, there's only one way, let me put it to you,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   as it is put so perfectly at the end of the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "Seeing then," he says, "that we have a great high priest that is passed through the heavens,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Jesus, the Son of God."
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Then he goes on to describe him as a high priest who can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Then he comes to the prayer, "Let us therefore," he says, "therefore let us come boldly unto the throne of grace
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Did you notice his "therefore"?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "Therefore let us come boldly."
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   What's it refer to?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Oh, it refers to the truth about the great high priest, Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   who has passed through the heavens, and all the truth about him.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   That's the only way to be bold in the presence of God.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   If I look at myself, I can't be bold.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I become speechless.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   With Job I put my hand upon my mouth.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I have heard of thee, but now I see thee, and I can't speak.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   But I must speak if I am to intercede.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   How can I do so with confidence and assurance?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   There's only one answer.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It is to know that my great high priest is Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and that by his blood I have a right of entry into the holiest of all,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and can go there with boldness.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Notice the boldness and the confidence and the assurance with which Moses prayed.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And as I say, this is not only characteristic of Moses,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   but of all the great men of prayer in the Bible and ever since.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Read some of the prayers of the saints of the centuries,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and you'll find this selfsame thing.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   But let me hurry to a second point which is most valuable and interesting.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Did you notice the element of reasoning and of arguing that came in?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   It's very daring, but it's very true.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Let me remind you of it.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Listen to Moses praying.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Moses said unto the Lord, "See."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Which really means this.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Do you see?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   He's arguing with God.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   "See, thou sayest unto me, 'Bring up this people,'
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Then, yet thou hast said"--you see, he's reminding God of what he said.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   He's having an argument with God.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   "Yet thou hast said, 'I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.'
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Now, therefore," says Moses, as if he was saying to God,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   "Be logical, be consistent, carry out your own argument.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   You can't say this to me and then not do anything.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Now, therefore, I pray thee, if," still arguing,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   "I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   and consider that this nation is thy people."
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And then in verse 16, you see, "For," he says, "wherein," if you don't do this,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   "wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Is it not in that thou goest with us?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   So shall we be separated."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   He reasoned with God.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   He argued with God.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   He reminded God of his own promises, and he pleaded with God in the light of them.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   He reminded God of his own declarations, and said,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   "Oh, God, can't you see that having said this, you must?"
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "Is it right, says someone, to speak to God like that?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Is not this presumption?"
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   No, no, these things, you see, go together.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   who talks so much about our going boldly to the throne of grace,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   at the same time reminds us that we do so always with reverence and with godly fear.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   This is all right.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   You see, what's happening here is this.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   It isn't a man under the law speaking to the law giver,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   "You dare not do this if you're in a legal position."
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   No, no, it's a child here speaking to his father.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And the little child can take liberties with his father that a grown-up man,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   who isn't his child, wouldn't dare not take with him.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Oh yes, this is a child speaking, and he knows it.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   God has spoken to him as a brother, as it were, face to face.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And Moses knew that, and he comes with his love and his reverence and his godly fear,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   and he ventures to argue.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He says, "You've said this, therefore."
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And again I commend you to read the biographies of men who've been used by God in the church throughout the centuries,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and especially in revival, and you'll find this same holy boldness,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   this argumentation, this reasoning, this putting the case to God,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   pleading his own promises, and saying, "You've said this."
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Oh, that's the whole secret of prayer, I sometimes think.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   At the moment, as I'm speaking of Thomas Goodwin,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   in his exposition of the sealing of the spirit in Ephesians 1, 3,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and that wonderful term that he uses, he says, "Sue him for it. Sue him for it."
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Don't leave him alone. Pester him, as it were, with his own promises.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Tell him what he said he's going to do. Quote the scripture to him.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And you know, God, he delights to hear us doing it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   As a father likes to see this element in his own child,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   who has been listening to what he's been saying.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   It pleases him. The child may be slightly impertinent, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   The father likes it in spite of that, and God's our father, and he loves us.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And he likes to hear us pleading his own promises, quoting his own words to him,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and saying, "In the light of this, can you refrain?"
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   It delights the heart of God. Sue him.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And then the next thing I would notice about the prayer is its orderliness,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   its directness, the specific petition.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   You notice that Moses here doesn't offer up some vague, indefinite, general prayer.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   No, no. He's concentrating on the one great need.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Of course he worshipped God.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Of course there was the reverence and the godly fear.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Yes, but at this point, it is this one thing, so he keeps concentrating on that.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   He won't get away from it. This presence of God.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   He says, "I won't move unless you come. You must come with us."
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And he gives his reasons. He plies him with all these arguments.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   The one thing.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   "And if I may speak for myself, I shall not feel happy and encouraged,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   until I feel that the church today is concentrating on this one thing."
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Prayer for revival. But we haven't come to it, my dear friends.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   We are still in the stage of deciding in committees to do this, that, and the other,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and then asking God to bless what we've done.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   No, no. There's no hope along that line.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   It must be this one thing. We must feel this burden.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   We must see this is the only hope.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And we must concentrate on this, and we must keep on with this.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   The orderliness, the arrangement, the concentration, the argument.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And I've already been suggesting at the last point, the urgency.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   You see, Moses here is like Jacob was in that passage we read there at the beginning,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   out of Genesis 32. This element always comes into true intercession.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   "I will not let thee go. I will not let thee go.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I'm going on. The morning is breaking. He'd been struggling through the night.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Let me go. No, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   The urgency. Read the great biblical prayers. It's always there.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Go back again and read that great statement in Acts 4.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's there now, they said. Oh God, now, in the light of this, in our situation.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Now, do this. Give us some indication.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Give us some signs. Enable us to witness with this holy boldness,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   and bear witness to the resurrection that they're prohibiting us to speak about.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   The urgency of the prayer.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Keeps on coming back to it, repeating it, putting it in different forms and from different angles.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   But there was just this one thing.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   "Unless thy presence go with me, take us not up hence."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Insisting, urgently, "I will not let thee go."
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Well, there it is. There, it seems to me, are some of the lessons that inherit.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   There are more to come, God willing.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   But there, for the moment, we have to leave it.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   We see what he prayed for.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   We see why he prayed for them.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And we see how he prayed for them.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   You say your prayers, but have you ever prayed?
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Do we know anything about this encounter, this meeting?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Have we the assurance of sins forgiven?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Are we free from ourselves and self-concern that we may intercede?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Have we a real burden for the glory of God and the name of the church?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Have we this concern for those who are outside?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And are we pleading with God for his own namesake?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Because of his own promises to hear us and to answer us?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Oh, may God make of us intercessors such as Moses.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   It's no use anybody saying, "Ah, but he was an exceptionally great man."
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   I've already demonstrated to you, Sunday morning after Sunday morning,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   that God, in the past history of revivals, has made use of men who are mere nobodies
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   in exactly the same way as he used Moses here.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   James McQuilkin, a hundred years ago in Northern Ireland, you'd never heard his name before.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   He was the man whom God burdened in this way.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   He was the Moses a hundred years ago in Northern Ireland.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It can be any one of us.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   May God make of us intercessors such as Moses was.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Amen.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
