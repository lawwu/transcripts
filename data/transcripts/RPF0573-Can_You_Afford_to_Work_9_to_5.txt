[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.660]   It's a problem that people in a rural context frequently face and it's a problem I think that has new solutions in today's world. The challenge is if you're going to move out into a rural context, how are you going to provide a living for yourself to be able to buy the things that you need to buy? If you want to be the poorest person in the world, just go and become a subsistence farmer trying to be 100% independent and self-sufficient and you will live a lifestyle of poverty. It is impossible to live a lifestyle of poverty if you don't have the means to do so.
