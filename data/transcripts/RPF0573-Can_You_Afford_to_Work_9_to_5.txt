[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.600]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   I'm your host.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.520]   And today I want to share with you one couple's story and their answer to a question, namely,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.160]   can you afford to work nine to five?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.560]   I'm often struck in my own personal perusals as I enjoy reading older books and older magazines,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.760]   I'm struck at how little is new.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.240]   Truly, I think Solomon had it right in most things when he said, "There's nothing new
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   under the sun."
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.040]   Much of many of the questions, much of the advice that we receive and give in today's
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.240]   world, it's not new.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's just a slightly different variation of what's happened before.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.920]   I recently was reading an older book, a compendium published 35 years ago by Mother Earth News.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.120]   And in this compendium of articles, I was struck by so many of the articles and how
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.880]   applicable they were to today's world.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.640]   The same problems that people were wrestling with back then are the same problems that
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.240]   certain people are wrestling with today.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.080]   I have a soft spot and an interest in reading some of these old back to the land stories.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.320]   And even the current back to the land stories.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.960]   But when I use that phrase, I'm referring to the movement that came out of the 1970s
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.640]   and the 1980s with a fairly broad section of US Americans trying to pack up shop and
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.360]   leave the urban centers and move out to the country.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.320]   And it was a movement of mixed success.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   There certainly were some people who were able to make a go of it, but there were a
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.960]   lot of people who really failed.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   And I think the reason many of them failed was the inability to create an income in a
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.320]   rural context.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.880]   It's a problem that people in a rural context frequently face.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.160]   And it's a problem I think that has new solutions in today's world.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.400]   The challenge is if you're going to move out into a rural context, how are you going to
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.360]   provide a living for yourself to be able to buy the things that you need to buy?
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   If you want to be the poorest person in the world, just go and become a subsistence farmer,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.560]   trying to be 100% independent and self-sufficient, and you will live a lifestyle of poverty.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.040]   It is impossible to be wealthy and to live a fully independent, self-sufficient lifestyle.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.760]   So the challenge is how much dependence do you build?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.360]   And many people want to go out and take responsibility for many of the functions in their life, but
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.480]   they still need some source of income.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   And one of the major areas where the back to the land movement of the '70s and '80s
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.200]   came to really break down was how to create that income.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.720]   If you want to move into a rural context, you're limited to either selling your services
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.200]   or certain products to create cash for yourself.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.360]   In selling services on the job market, a job market in rural areas where land is cheap
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.560]   usually is much more constricted than in an urban market.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   And usually you can't do quite as well with your specialized labor as you can in an urban
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.600]   area, so your wages are likely to be lower or non-existent.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   And the same problem you face with products.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   Many of the products that you could sell in an urban context frequently just aren't saleable
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.960]   in a rural context.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.120]   But I think we have new solutions now.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.080]   And although there have always been people who figured out how to go out and move to
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.160]   the country if that's what they wanted to do, there have always been people who've been
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.720]   able to do that, whether they worked the mail order business or they did their work by correspondence.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.360]   There are a bunch of models that I've found from the old days.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.200]   But today it's much easier because you can take almost any mainstream profession today
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.900]   and digitize it in some way.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.160]   And if you can digitize that work in some way, then you can disconnect yourself from
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   a geographic location.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   In the early days of online businesses, when I first became interested 15, 20 years ago,
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.680]   you basically made your money by teaching people about online business.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.640]   And it was a very new and weird thing.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   But today it's a very normal thing.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.380]   And there are dozens and dozens, a lot of paths into that type of lifestyle.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.880]   So in reading these articles from this compendium, I was struck by a few of them in particular.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.300]   And this one that I'm going to share with you today is called, "Can you afford to work
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.640]   9-5?"
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.280]   And the article succinctly demonstrates something that I've talked about extensively on the
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.700]   show.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.860]   One of the challenges with rural living is creating income.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.280]   One of the challenges with urban living is creating savings.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   Because it seems like the whole urban lifestyle that so many of us are accustomed to is built
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.760]   around constant and never-ending consumption.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.880]   And in a way, you are like a hamster on a treadmill, or on a wheel, constantly just
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.840]   going around and around and around, but not making any progress.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.960]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.600]   But a lot of people start to wake up and look around and say, "I'm just getting older and
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.560]   older and I'm not making a lot of progress.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.720]   I'm not saving a lot of money.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.240]   I'm not living the life that I want to live."
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.560]   And that's what the Back to the Land movement of the 1970s and 80s has in common with the
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   Back to the Land movement of today, 2018.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.280]   People are still looking for that sense of an appropriate pace of life.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.000]   And again, my personal ambition is to be a gentleman farmer.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   I think that's a great pace of life.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.920]   You have time for physical manual labor and time for intellectual stimulation.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040]   In my mind, that's ideal.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   Let me share with you this article because it's super fun to read other people's contexts
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.320]   from many years ago, but then to apply them and to think about them in today's world.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.520]   So enjoy the lower numbers and recognize the constant and never-ending destruction of your
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.120]   wealth that inflation brings.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.840]   I enjoy listening to the older solutions.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.440]   And then think about your own situation and see if you have some creative ideas to work
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.120]   in your own context.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.680]   The article is called, "Can You Afford to Work 9 to 5?" from a Mother Earth News publication
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.680]   published back in the mid-1980s.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   While many people yearn for a lovely and conventional suburban home with a predictable 9 to 5 routine,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.160]   that kind of security had lost its charm for at least one couple.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.320]   Their dream was of a place in the country and of a way of life inextricably bound to
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.720]   the land.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.640]   Both husband and wife were employed, but after each tightly scheduled and often unsatisfying
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.600]   day, their dream of a simpler existence had become ever more appealing.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.240]   One night, the wife, armed with pen and paper, decided to analyze the economics of the job
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.520]   she held.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.360]   She had been hoping that it was helping them to reach their "back to the land" goal, but
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.080]   her computations indicated otherwise.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.840]   The hard, cold figures showed that she was not only failing to save money toward the
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   goal, but she was actually spending more money on job-related expenses than she had supposed.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.360]   Her startling discovery was that she could not afford to keep her job.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   Her salary as a teacher totaled $9,000 a year, yet her spendable income, consisting of net
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.600]   wages minus work-connected expenses, came to only $2,530 annually.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.400]   The cost of working was quite amazing.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.560]   Here is how her income was being distributed before any personal expenses.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.200]   Salary $9,000 State and federal taxes $1,500
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.720]   Car payment $135 a month for $1,620 per year
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.800]   Gasoline for commuting at $160 a month = $1,920 per year
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.680]   Auto repair tolls miscellaneous $480 per year
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.240]   Vehicle insurance and registration $350 per year
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.960]   Working wardrobe repair cleaning $600 per year for total work-related expenses of $6,470
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   $9,000 of salary less $6,470 of work-related expenses = a net spendable income of $2,530
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.920]   She decided that if there were no greater benefit than that to be had from her 9-5 routine,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.760]   it was time to let go of it.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   So with little hesitation, she did just that.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   From then on, she managed to augment her husband's salary by cashing in on her love of horses.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.600]   Years of training and riding, combined with her teaching experience, blended to produce
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.760]   a career instructing young horsemen and horsewomen that provided not only an income, but lots
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.320]   of outdoor activity as well.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.920]   The new "job" also afforded her more leisure time to develop home and garden skills that
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.720]   helped to stretch what money she did bring home.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.680]   The new occupation eliminated the need for a second family vehicle, so they were able
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.720]   to barter their car for two acres of remote New Hampshire land.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.800]   Once they acquired that property, they immediately wanted to relocate to it, and upon closer
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.880]   examination of the husband's earnings, they realized that the idea of simply packing up
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.640]   and trying to make do in a rural setting wasn't too far-fetched at all.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   The following figures demonstrate how much of his income was being used each year to
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.960]   do no more than maintain their suburban lifestyle.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   Salary $16,550 per year State and federal taxes $1,800 per year
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.840]   Mortgage payments at $235 a month $2,820 per year
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:52.960]   Property taxes $1,200 per year Electricity at $75 per month $900 per year
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.520]   Telephone at $40 per month $480 per year Oil heat $1,000 per year
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   Truck payment of $107 per month $1,284 per year
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:14.220]   Gasoline at $100 per month $1,200 per year Truck repair miscellaneous $360 per year
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.560]   Vehicle insurance and registration $350 per year
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.520]   Food at $250 per month $3,000 per year
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.760]   Dining, local travel, entertainment $1,200 per year
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.480]   Clothing $480 per year A $16,550 salary less total living expenses
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:41.080]   of $16,074 equals a net spendable income of $476.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.880]   Faced with those facts, the couple made the decision to abandon their suburban way of
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   life.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   They sold their house and moved on to the two paid-for country acres, where they built
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.820]   a small, mortgage-free camp.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.700]   They now cook with bottled gas for a mere $6 a month, and their light is produced by
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.100]   economical kerosene lanterns.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.100]   A small barrel stove has taken the place of a costly oil furnace, and wood obtained through
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.240]   barter provides all their heat.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.580]   A brook on the property supplies all the water they need.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.100]   The husband's financed pickup truck, and its accompanying payments, has been replaced
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.120]   by a used van (completely paid for) that has been converted into a camper.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.220]   In a short time, the annual budget looked more like this.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   Present combined income $7,400 per year Rent and mortgage $0
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.560]   Car payments $0 Electricity $0
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.060]   Wood heat $0 Income taxes $120 per year
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:43.940]   Property taxes $75 per year Telephone (occasionally use of payphone)
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.140]   $100 per year Bottled gas and kerosene $120 per year
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.520]   Gasoline (errands and travel to seasonal work) $600 per year
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.140]   Vehicle insurance and registration $300 per year
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.260]   Food (to supplement the edibles they produce, hunt or forage) $1,400
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.620]   Clothing (leaving city jobs really cut this expense) $300
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:16.340]   So annual income of $7,400 per year, less total living expenses of $3,055 per year,
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:23.220]   equals a net spendable income of $4,345 per year, whereas previously the net spendable
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:29.900]   income from her job was $2,530 per year, and the net spendable income for him in his lifestyle
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.340]   was $476 per year.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.700]   It's easy to see that their change of lifestyle has resulted in having more cash to spend
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.320]   than they did before.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.580]   Because both are finally free of the 40-hour week, they can devote themselves full-time
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.960]   to gardening, foraging, fishing, hunting, freelance writing (which helps to pay their
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.780]   bills) and traveling.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.220]   The couple's pleasure expenses have actually increased since their move to the country.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.920]   For example, they rented out their camp, another source of income, while they spent a year
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.900]   exploring in Alaska.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:08.260]   After three months on the road, with expenses totaling $2,900 for 12,000 miles of unforgettable
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.740]   experiences, they took jobs as caretakers of a remote cabin on the Alaskan coast.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.640]   There they enjoyed the icy splendor of glaciers and snow-capped peaks while they continued
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.460]   to expand their knowledge and skills.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.380]   This man and woman are living their dream, but what it took was the conviction to free
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.400]   themselves from the life they thought they couldn't afford to leave.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.140]   Until they faced the facts and figures, they never realized the astronomical costs involved
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.100]   in maintaining a suburban lifestyle.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.420]   It seems that the solution to money problems sometimes lies not in earning more, but rather
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.620]   in simplifying one's way of life and perhaps even earning less.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.380]   Moving from a dwelling in an area with a high cost of living, to a dream farm or camp in
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.740]   the country, to that place where you can garden, cut your own wood, and possibly even raise
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.180]   your own dairy or meat animals may be the answer to your financial dilemma.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.340]   In fact, you may be able to eliminate entirely that tedious 40-hour work week and meet your
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.160]   reduced expenditures with a part-time or seasonal job or a home business.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.420]   The transition from a life in suburbia to one on the farm does take time, thought, and
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.740]   money.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:25.140]   How much of each you'll need will depend on your skills, level of determination, desired
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.900]   lifestyle, and current equities.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.200]   You may have to cash in some assets and deplete your personal savings, devote extra time to
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.520]   honing a talent that will bring in the income you'll require, and learn the skills necessary
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.820]   to live in harmony with the earth.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.300]   Whatever method you adopt to rid yourself of those Monday morning blues, rest assured
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.220]   it can be done, and the entire process can prove to be an exciting journey, one that
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:15:08.900]   may far exceed all of your original dreams.
