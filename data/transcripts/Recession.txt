[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   What is up everybody not the stock market it's Sam from financial samurai and in this episode
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.240]   I want to talk about the probability of a recession happening what we should do if a recession comes and the difference between a
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.700]   Recession and a bear market because there are some subtle differences
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.640]   So I think the probability of recession happening over the next 12 months is about 70%
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.600]   And the reason why is due to four things one the yield curve has flattened
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.660]   So the spread between the two-year Treasury yield which is on the shorter end and the 10-year Treasury yield
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.480]   Which is on the longer end has compressed to the narrowest margin since March 2020
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.800]   so a flat or
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.480]   Inverted yield curve so inverted yield curve is when the short end yield is higher than the long end yield is a reliable
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.440]   Recession indicator if you look at history you look at the st. Louis Fred chart
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.440]   every time the yield curve has inverted almost every time it looks like over the next 12 months a recession has occurred and
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.040]   Why is that? What is the significance of an inverted or flat yield curve?
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.800]   Well when it's inverted it means that people are not bullish or optimistic about the future
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   So they're unwilling to invest in the future
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.360]   Because they're uncertain about the future right the worst case World War three happens
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.920]   You know one to ten percent chance some people say and if that happens, there's gonna be a tremendous amount of pain
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   So instead people want to invest in shorter duration. They're gonna accept lower returns for the higher probability that they'll get their money back
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.520]   Thankfully expectations for aggressive Fed rate hikes over the next 12 to 24 months have declined
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   However, even if the Fed doesn't hike at all
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.740]   The yield curve could still turn negative since the Fed doesn't control the Treasury bond market
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.920]   The market does and this is something very important for people to understand when everybody
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.580]   You know might freak out about the Fed hiking rates and they're like, oh no mortgage rates are gonna go up
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.900]   Well, that's not necessarily the case at all because the Fed doesn't control the bond market the market does you and I do
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.560]   The Fed could be behind or ahead of the curve
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160]   You just don't know I would rather trust the market then, you know
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.880]   Seven Fed board governors the second reason why a recession could be imminent is because long bond yields are not spiking with surging
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.260]   energy prices
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.840]   Energy prices are obviously surging due to the war in Ukraine
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.380]   Given Russia is one big gas station leaving economic sanctions will hurt the global supply of oil and gas
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.540]   Now President Biden is talking about cutting off
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.980]   Imports of Russian oil and gas and the EU is talking about reducing its dependency by 65%
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.820]   So as a result, there's less supply and prices go up usually in a surging inflationary environment
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.660]   Longer term duration Treasury bonds would normally increase as bonds sell off
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.460]   however
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.420]   the 10-year Treasury bond yield actually declined from about 2% to
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.940]   1.7 percent and it just can't seem to get past 2% and the reason again is that the fear of a recession
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.900]   The fear of losing money is greater than the fear of higher inflation
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.580]   in other words investors would rather own safety and lose in real terms rather than invest in risk assets and lose in nominal and
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.700]   Real terms. Alright, so let's say you buy a 10-year Treasury bond that yields 1.8%
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.260]   But it yields a negative 5.7 percent real return because inflation is at 7.5%
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.660]   People are saying that's preferable to losing a nominal 20% in the stock market because it's tanking and a negative
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.700]   27.5%
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.420]   Return real return because of inflation
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.300]   So for many of us if we could rewind time
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.680]   We could say well the wisdom of investing in I bonds paying 7 plus percent is pretty darn good and the wisdom
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.420]   Investing in municipal bonds that are double tax-free
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.560]   Pretty darn good in this scenario in the future when you're thinking about investing in a low-risk asset
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.340]   Don't think so much about making a small nominal or real return
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.420]   Instead think about how much of your capital you can protect on the downside a third reason why a recession might be imminent
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.140]   Negative real wage growth is a recessionary sign
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:27.220]   So although real wage growth is strong for lower income earners real wage growth overall is negative due to high inflation
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.020]   We're just not making as much as inflation
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.140]   However, unlike with negative real mortgage rates, which is great for real estate negative real wage growth is negative for the economy
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.180]   Right things are just simply getting more and more expensive even though you're making more and more money
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.260]   There is a chart in my link post from Bank of America
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.840]   That says if real wage growth is still negative by summer the chance of a US recession increases
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.940]   Well, I think there's probably a 90 plus percent probability that real wage growth will be negative in
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.380]   45 months therefore the chances of a US recession is
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.420]   Pretty high based on this data point and this data point is also a great reminder to continue to try to
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.300]   increase the percentage of your income coming from
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:20.140]   Investments and not labor because income from investments are much easier in terms of moving with inflation
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.820]   Whereas income from your job, you know, there's a lot more friction. You've got to be a good employee
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.460]   You have to have good relationships with your manager. You've got to
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.540]   Chart what you've done for the company and you've got to ask for a raise and you've also got to probably thread into job
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.140]   Hop or actually do job hop so it's much harder to get market wage
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:47.860]   Whereas when it comes to investing it's much more automatic and the final point of why a recession could be imminent
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.580]   Is that drastically higher energy prices have historically preceded a recession another great chart in the post goes back to?
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.980]   1970 and if you see every single spike in oil Brent price, you know over 104 a
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.420]   Recession looks to be highly probable over the next 12 to 24 months right now oil is spiking to
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:17.420]   $130 a barrel could go higher and higher who knows but what we do know is that you know prices at the pump are
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.300]   Going, you know, it's over $4 per gallon average in America, which is still much lower than in the UK
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   Let's let's not take our prices for granted. But you know in coastal cities. We're talking $6
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:37.340]   Price per gallon which is a lot and that just squeezes the consumer and thankfully, you know heating costs for your home should go down
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.980]   Because we're entering spring and summer months which use less energy
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.320]   But then again, there's cooling costs to deal with for probably half of the country
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.260]   So given I believe there's a 70% chance a recession is coming over the next 12 months
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.580]   There are some things you should really think about
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.860]   The main thing is if you have a job is to develop your relationships now with the people who control more power at your organization
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.080]   You know reach out to people before you need something instead of after you need something right now
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.180]   The labor market is robust. No doubt about it
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.580]   If you go on the streets people are spending their money having a good time because kovat is waiting. Thank goodness, right?
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.220]   However, we're trying to think forward. We're trying to think over the next 12 months
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:30.340]   Just put yourself in the shoes of the CEO or your direct hiring manager who has seen their share price go down
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:38.620]   20 to 80 percent or they've completely round-tripped any gains they made since the pandemic began in 2020
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.660]   But the labor force is much higher and then profits are waning or slowing down
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.660]   so it stands to reason very logically that
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.420]   Managers are gonna try to make employees do more with less
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.980]   They're gonna slow down their hiring and as a result, you know wage pressure will slowly
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.500]   Decrease and if things get too bad or some companies just have just kind of crushed
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.780]   They're gonna start letting people go and historically even in good times companies would let go
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:14.460]   Five to ten percent of their worst performers every single year. This is like the GE Jack Welch tradition
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.740]   And if we go into a recession, obviously that's going to increase so you've got to be thinking ahead
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.820]   Six twelve twenty four months and all the signs are pointing towards a slowdown
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.980]   So it's wise for you to boost your cash reserves boost your defensive assets
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.420]   Network strongly and look for other jobs now before the rush
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.860]   Happens where everybody is starting to freak out and look for new jobs
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.460]   Even though I believe there's a 70% chance a recession will come over the next 12 months
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.780]   That still means there's a 30% chance that there will be no recession
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:55.620]   We're gonna be able to navigate this cruddy time right now. Maybe the war ends over the next couple of weeks
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.540]   maybe there's just peace on earth again and
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:05.980]   You know things stabilize the VIX or the volatility index is currently trading above 30. That's an elevated level
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.140]   But that's actually good
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.900]   So the VIX measures the level of risk fear or stress in the market when making investment decisions and when it is elevated
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.180]   Historically if you're buying when the VIX is at 30 or above over the next 12 months
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.260]   There tends to be a really good return on the S&P 500
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.340]   Specifically we're talking about a 15 to 25 percent return
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.020]   Well, you know, hopefully that doesn't happen because hey the S&P 500 is already down about 15%
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:40.060]   The Nasdaq is already down over 20% and speaking of the Nasdaq. It's officially in a bear market
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.980]   So what's the difference between a bear market and a recession not too much?
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:52.740]   but if you are an investor who has a predominant portion of your net worth in risk assets or if you're a
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.500]   Retiree who is depending on most of your investments to fund your lifestyle
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.060]   Then a bear market is worse than a recession at the margin here. I look at my own example
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.020]   I don't have a day job. Yeah, my wife could fire me, but that's probably not wise
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.060]   It's probably not gonna happen, but I don't have a day job to fear losing
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.900]   When you're in a recession
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:22.380]   The biggest fear is losing your job and losing money in your investments that double combination is pretty bad
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.100]   Because if you lose your job
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.220]   You don't have that disposable income power to buy on the low and to make up for your paper losses
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:35.100]   So if you have a day job, you should fear a recession more if you don't have a day job
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.620]   Then you should fear a bear market more. However, obviously either scenario is a suboptimal scenario
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.820]   It's just the way you want to think about things going forward
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.260]   Personally, my goal is to continue living the way I want even if a recession or a bear market arrives
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.540]   Living the way I want means spending more time with my little ones and less time working online
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.340]   I also plan to travel more with my family to see my parents and in-laws, you know this summer
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.020]   I think is gonna be a boom time for travel
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.100]   I'll just be poor in the process right because my investments are going down
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:15.900]   Look, it really stinks to be losing money and losing our progress our financial progress buys us time
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.340]   And that's the most important commodity of all
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.220]   however
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.980]   I will conclude by saying the best hedge against a recession is to continue living every day with joy and
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.060]   Meaning thanks so much for listening. If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a positive review and a comment. It keeps me going
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.620]   Take care
