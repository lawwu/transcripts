[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Pastor John, how would you care for a young couple coming to terms with
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.640]   infertility and feelings of failure? What would you want them to know about God in
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.020]   light of his apparent withheld blessings? I would want them to know that God is
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.880]   sovereign, and that Satan does not have the upper hand here, and infertility
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   does not have the upper hand here. God always has the upper hand because he's
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.280]   God, and then I would want them to know that God is good. I just read yesterday
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.600]   Psalm 25, "Good and upright is the Lord," and then I'd want them to know that He's
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.680]   wise, infinitely wise, and His timing, His giving, and His withholding are all done
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.480]   in an infinite wisdom as He shapes and guides our lives for our ultimate good
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.280]   and for the glory of His name. I'd want them to know that God can give life, and
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.720]   therefore I would pray with that couple. I would covenant with them. I would pray
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.200]   with them every day. I'd lay my hands on them, and I would ask God, "Give them life.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.660]   Give them a child. Lord, whoever's infertile here, work a miracle, O God, if
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.880]   you would be pleased to do that." I would ask for it, and if God chose
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.000]   then not to do it, I would remind them, "No good thing does he withhold from
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.320]   those who walk uprightly." That's probably one of the hardest verses for a mom or a
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.680]   dad to hear in that situation, "No good thing does he withhold from those who
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.000]   walk uprightly," which means for whatever reason, this withholding right now is
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.440]   good. God has something good. Seek the kingdom first, and all that you need will
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.960]   be added to you. If there's a thorn in your flesh, and this thorn might be
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.480]   infertility, ask, "God, what are you doing with this thorn?" He's
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.440]   going to answer, "My grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.840]   weakness." So I would probably end by taking them, and I go to this text
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.360]   because I've talked with some women at Bethlehem who have found amazing
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.160]   comfort in this Isaiah 56, 3-5. It goes like this, "Let not the foreigner who has
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.680]   joined himself to the Lord say, 'The Lord will surely separate me from his people,'
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.900]   and let not the eunuch say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.'" So there's a person who can't
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.820]   sire children or bear children. "Behold, don't say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.' For
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.760]   thus says the Lord, 'To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose the things
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.080]   that please me, and hold fast my covenant, I will give in my house and within my
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.720]   walls a monument and a name better than sons and daughters. I will give them an
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.640]   everlasting name that shall not be cut off.'" That's Isaiah 56, 3-5, which I
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.520]   know is hard to feel and hard to believe, but that's what faith is. Faith takes a
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.040]   verse like that, "Okay, you have withheld from me my desired son or daughter, and
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.000]   you're going to give me a monument and a name better than sons and daughters."
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   That's simply amazing, and I think we ought to hold fast to it. Jesus never
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.120]   had children, and Paul never had children, and I'm sure they looked at little
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.800]   children and thought, "Now that's a joy that I would love to have," and God
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   withheld marriage and child-having from those two men, and gave them instead a
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   monument and a name, both in this life and in the life to come, that is superior.
