[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of that eighth psalm
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.280]   which we read at the beginning. And let me read again verses three and four. Verses three
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.720]   and four in Psalm number eight.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.420]   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, and the moon and the stars which
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.060]   thou hast ordained, what is men that thou art mindful of him, and the son of men that
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:40.760]   thou visitest him? We are met together, as most of you realize, on a centenary occasion,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.080]   celebrating the founding of this church a hundred years ago. We are happy and glad to
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.760]   do so. But there are not as many people in the world tonight, and perhaps some even in
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.080]   this congregation, who would query the appropriateness of what we are doing and query the rightness
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.760]   of what we are doing. We are living in an age, as I needn't trouble to tell you, in
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.440]   which the vast majority of the people regard the Christian church as outmoded, out of date,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.680]   a mere anachronism in this modern world. And they not only think that of the church, they
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.880]   think likewise of the message of the church. They take the view that perhaps there may
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.440]   have been some kind of value in this sort of thing during the centuries and perhaps
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   even a hundred years ago and perhaps even in the early years of this present century.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.840]   But by now, they feel that the church is almost ridiculous and that she has nothing whatsoever
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.000]   to say to the modern world. In other words, there may be those who say to themselves,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "Well, it's all right to celebrate something that's happened in the past, but the question
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.920]   is are you proposing to go on with this? Is this just a moment at which you pause to thank
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.960]   God for the past and then to gain new strength and encouragement to face the future?" They
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.760]   query, I say, the whole position of the Christian church and feel that she is completely irrelevant
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.880]   in this modern world in which we live.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.480]   And of course, what they say about the church in general, they say about the individual
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.320]   Christian also. What they feel about us is that we don't seem to be aware of what is
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.680]   happening in the great world round and about us, that we are not amazed and staggered by
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.240]   these extraordinary scientific developments in particular. It is this, they feel, that
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   has put our message entirely out of court and makes it entirely dated and outmoded.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.840]   They say that we are people who don't think. We don't seem to be abreast of the times.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.800]   And instead of reading as they do and listening to the news and making themselves acquainted
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.960]   with all these vast developments, we seem to pull down the blinds and turn in upon ourselves
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.760]   and turn to the past and just perpetuate something that people were doing quite appropriately
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   a thousand years ago and more, but which, as I say, by today is utterly ridiculous.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.160]   Now that's their idea of us, that the Christian is a small man, as I was saying this morning,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.280]   a narrow man, confined and cramped in his thinking and in his outlook, and not aware
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.040]   of what is happening in the great world round and about him, and that therefore, obviously,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.880]   the message of the Christian church to the modern world is nil, null, and void.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.240]   Now I want to meet that situation this evening. We are here not only to thank God for the
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.480]   past. We are here to face the future. We are here indeed to say that the only hope for
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800]   the world tonight is the message of the Christian church.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.600]   Now how do we do so? Well, let me try to do so in terms of this criticism, this modern
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.840]   criticism that is brought so constantly against us. How do we deal with it? Well, I would
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.560]   deal with it in this way. I suggest that the man who is not a Christian, the man of the
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   modern world, as he likes to call himself, comes to the conclusion that we don't think
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.000]   and face the facts, simply because we don't think as he does.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.720]   Whereas the real truth is that the only people who really are thinking in this modern world
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.760]   are Christian people. Now that's the assertion which I make on behalf of the Christian church
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.360]   and the Christian gospel and the Christian message, that it is only those who are governed
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.240]   by this truth who really are facing the facts and thinking in a true sense.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.680]   In other words, the great division in the world tonight is between those who think superficially,
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   if they think at all, and those who think deeply. Now our contention is that the man
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.520]   of the world who claims to be such a great thinker, rarely doesn't think at all, that
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   he merely reacts on the surface. He's aware of things and gives a temporary reaction,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.560]   but he never really thinks them through. He hasn't a real understanding of life and of
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.800]   everything that's happening in it, and thus he's a victim of circumstance and chance.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   Our contention, on the other hand, is that the man who is governed by the biblical teaching
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.960]   is a man who thinks and thinks deeply. Now the difference can be put like this. The
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.320]   Christian thinks and thinks truly, because his thinking is governed by the teaching of
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.640]   this book. That's what makes us Christian. The Christian is a man whose whole outlook
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.360]   upon life is governed by this teaching. You remember how the Apostle Paul puts it in the
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.920]   second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 5, verse 17, "If any man be in Christ," he
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.120]   says, "he's a new creature, a new creation. All things are passed away. Behold, all things
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.640]   have become new." He's got the mind of Christ. He doesn't think as he used to think before.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:44.480]   His thinking is governed entirely by this teaching. And the result of that is that it
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.760]   is deep thinking. It is profound thinking. That's the big difference between the Christian
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   and the non-Christian.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.360]   Now it's all put in one word in this eighth psalm and in this third verse, which I've
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.320]   read to you. It's this word "consider." "When I consider thy heavens," says the psalmist.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.240]   Now the men of the world, the men who's not governed by this biblical thinking, he doesn't
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.120]   consider. He sees, he observes, he reacts superficially, then he forgets all about it.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   Then the next excitement comes and on he goes. He never really faces it. He doesn't consider
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:32.040]   it. He doesn't examine it. He doesn't ask questions about it. He doesn't work it out.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.340]   He doesn't follow it to its ultimate implications. And the result is that his supposed thinking
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.320]   is nothing but some superficial kind of reaction.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.680]   Well now, I want to demonstrate all this to you by taking just one example. We're all
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.480]   mindful, are we not, of what happened some eighteen months ago. To be precise, it was
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:05.840]   on July the 20th, 1969. When we were all thrilled and amazed at the news and perhaps watching
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:14.480]   in televisions, two men literally walking on the surface of the moon. The most astonishing
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.640]   achievement of men beyond any question. And there it is, something that the whole world
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.520]   was looking at. Now I want to show you the difference between the non-Christian and the
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:35.800]   Christian as they looked at that one event. The Christian is as aware of this as anybody
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.000]   else. It's said that he doesn't think. Now I want to show you that he alone really does
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.600]   think. He alone realizes exactly what was happening there. Because he considers it.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   Whereas the other men only react slightly to it. That's what happens, isn't it? That's
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   what happened on that occasion.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.440]   Well the world, of course, got excited for the time being at this news. But it had forgotten
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.280]   it. Almost the next day, then something else happens. Gets excited about that. Indeed,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.160]   I happened to be in America when this great event happened. And I shall never forget it.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.920]   The Daily Newspapers, there on the left-hand side in bold print was this amazing achievement
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:21.360]   of men, two men walking on the surface of the moon. But with equal prominence on the
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.000]   right-hand side of the front page of the same paper, there was an account of the indiscretion
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   of a well-known American politician. And the two things seem to be parallel. That's the
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.720]   mind of the world. The gossip about the private life of politicians is to them as important
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.640]   as men walking on the surface of the moon. That shows the superficiality of it all. The
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:54.760]   world just reacts lightly superficially, but never really considers.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:02.880]   But as this man reminds us in his eighth psalm, when the Christian, the man of God, considers,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.360]   looks up at the heavens and the moon and the stars which God has ordained, he doesn't merely
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.560]   react lightly superficially and then forget all about it. He considers it. And it leads
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   him to some of the profoundest conclusions that a man can ever arrive at. So that what
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.400]   I'm doing tonight is this. I'm going to test you, my friends. Are we Christians or are
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.040]   we not? Well, you know, you can answer that question by your reaction to the two men walking
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:45.120]   on the surface of the moon. That can be decided by your reaction to this event and by what
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:53.560]   happens to you when you look at the heavens, the moon, and the stars.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:00.280]   Now let me show you how you can test yourself in this way. This man puts it quite clearly
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:09.560]   before us. He says, "When I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.220]   stars which thou hast ordained, what is men that thou art mindfully more the son of men
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:24.360]   that thou visitest him?" What's he saying? Well, what he's saying is this, that as the
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:33.720]   Christian looks at these things and contemplates them, he is filled with amazement at the greatness
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:42.600]   and the marvel of the universe. "I consider thy heavens," he starts with it, "O Lord,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:50.360]   our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:57.800]   heavens." The glory, the marvel, the wonder, the amazement of the universe.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:04.560]   "But wait a minute," says someone. "Surely that's not right. Surely the man who rarely
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.760]   appreciates the marvel and the greatness of the universe is the scientist, is the man
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   who's not a Christian." He said, "You Christians, you are the little people, you're not aware
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.120]   of these things and you're opposed to science." He said, "You mustn't claim that you as Christians
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.440]   are the ones who are aware of the marvel and the amazing character of the universe, for
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.680]   surely," he says, "it is the Christian church who has always opposed scientific development."
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.120]   Now, you're familiar with this, aren't you? There are many people tonight who never darken
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.000]   the doors of a place of worship such as this because they say that science is what governs
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.080]   them and that the church has always been opposed to science and scientific development. This
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.280]   is a common charge. People give this as a reason for not being Christians. They say
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.760]   it's anti-scientific and has always put a brake on scientific development.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.280]   Now, what do we say to this? Well, there's one great case generally, and you've often
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.760]   probably had to deal with it, is the famous case that's always trotted out, the case of
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.240]   Galileo. You see, you're talking about astronomy and so on. Now, isn't it a fact that it was
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:23.160]   the church that opposed the discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo and persecuted them
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.480]   and punished them for simply pronouncing the truth and reporting their discoveries? It's
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.200]   the church that opposed these people and persecuted them cruelly. What do you say to that, they
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   say? Well, you know, the answer is very simple. It is quite true that the church persecuted
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:50.560]   Galileo, but remember, it was the Roman Catholic Church. And I don't say that merely in a spirit
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.080]   of criticism of Roman Catholicism, except to this extent, that the Roman Catholic Church
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:04.420]   persecuted Galileo not because of the teaching of the Bible, but because of the teaching
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:11.560]   of Greek philosophy, which she had added to the Bible. That is why they opposed Galileo,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   not in biblical terms, but because they were bound and fettered by the philosophy of Aristotle,
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.040]   the Greek. And that was the sole reason why they opposed Galileo and his findings. It
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.440]   was their philosophy that he disproved, not the teaching of the scriptures. Indeed, I
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.360]   can prove it still further. Secular historians today are admitting and agreeing one after
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:44.840]   the other that what gave the greatest impetus ever to scientific discovery was the Protestant
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   Reformation. You see, the Protestant Reformation liberated the minds of men from the shackles
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.080]   of this Greek philosophy and set them free and taught them how to think, liberated their
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:05.120]   minds and encouraged this scientific investigation. You know, it's not a bad thing for you people
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.040]   living in London to remember that the famous Royal Society, and it's the highest and the
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.920]   greatest scientific society in this country, there is no greater distinction a man can
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.840]   have than to be made a fellow of the Royal Society. Never let us forget that that came
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:27.720]   into being almost entirely as the result of the Puritan era. So the simple answer to this
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:35.800]   foolish criticism is that it is true Christianity, by liberating the minds of men and teaching
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:42.560]   them the truth about themselves, that has always been the greatest stimulus to scientific
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.840]   development. But here you see, way back a thousand years before Christ, David has seen
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.760]   the marvel and the wonder of the universe. And this is something that we need to point
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:03.960]   out to the modern men. You go and ask the modern men how he explains this universe.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.400]   He's fond of talking about billions of miles and distances and years. But ask him what
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.920]   is the explanation of the universe? And what he'll tell you is this. This is the non-Christian.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:23.440]   He'll say it's all an accident, all chance. That originally there was some big bang and
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.000]   some gases which were there, they don't know how, suddenly solidified and there you've
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.080]   got your present universe. It's all accident, you see, it's all chance, there's no rhyme,
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:38.800]   no reason. That's their view of the universe. Is that the marvelous universe? No, no, my
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.040]   dear friends, if you want to know the real marvel of the universe, you've got to look
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.640]   at it through the eyes of this man in the way that he does. "When I consider thy heavens,"
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:59.840]   he says, "I see the marvel of it all." There's only one explanation, the work of thy fingers.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   There's no other explanation, this isn't accident. And this is what astonishes me.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.040]   You see, the man of the world looks up and sees these men walking on the surface of the
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.480]   moon, says, "Isn't it marvelous?" Let's it go. He doesn't stop to say, "What makes that
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:21.280]   possible? How did that ever happen?" And there's only one answer. It's what I call the laws
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.920]   of nature. Those experiments and those successful achievements would never have been possible
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:34.000]   were it not that you can rely upon certain things always leading to certain effects.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.280]   Did you know this, my friends, that if this planet on which we live, our Earth, were only
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.720]   a little bit further away than it is, a very small fraction of a distance, further away
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.920]   from the sun, we'd all freeze up immediately. If it were only that corresponding distance
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.520]   nearer to the sun, we'd be burnt up in a moment. The world, the planet on which we live, is
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.680]   at the exact distance from the sun to make life possible. Did you know that it wouldn't
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.920]   have been possible for those men to land at the moon were it not that the angle at which
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:14.800]   the moon is with regard to the Earth is precisely what it is? And the moon, in the same way,
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.560]   is at a given angle to the sun. Is all this accident? The men of the world said, "Oh,
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.600]   it's all accidental. It's all happened." But surely this is an inadequate explanation.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.840]   How can you rely upon these laws? How can you assume that they'll be constant? Is it
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.720]   accident? Is it fortuitous? Is it some blind chance that has produced it all? That's what
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   the men of the world believe. But it's a totally inadequate explanation. And of course, many
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.400]   of the greatest scientists have always granted this. Take, for instance, a man like the late
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.960]   Sir James Jeans. He told us at the end of his long life that as a result of his scientific
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:06.080]   discoveries and investigations, he had come to the conclusion that there was a great mind
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.400]   at the back of the universe. He'd come to a further conclusion that God must be a great
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:19.600]   mathematician because he'd brought it down to details, to fractions, to decimal points.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:28.320]   A great mathematician. Oh, yes, but you see, the psalmist had said all this nearly 3,000
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:37.360]   years ago, "Oh, Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.080]   glory above the heavens." There's only one adequate explanation of the universe. It isn't
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.720]   accident. It isn't chance. It's the first verse in the Bible. "In the beginning, God,
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:20:01.280]   the Creator." The heavens, what are they? "The work of thy fingers." The mind of God.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:08.640]   The actions of the great Creator who is over all and sees the end from the beginning. Now,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.240]   it's only the man who's governed by this thinking who comes to that conclusion. The other man
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.000]   glibly dismisses it all as accident and chance, but it's impossible. I've often argued this.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.600]   I've often said that if I had no other reason for believing in God and in denying the theory
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.720]   of evolution, it is the fact of the human eye with its delicacy and its balance and
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.120]   its subtlety that all this should have happened accidentally, fortuitously. It's ridiculous.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:42.800]   The perfection, the design are such that there's only one adequate explanation, the mind of
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.760]   God. So that this Christian man, as he looks at it all, and the more he hears about this
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.520]   expanding universe and these gigantic distances, he doesn't stop merely at saying, "How marvelous."
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:03.040]   He says, "Oh, how great is the God who thought it all out, planned it all out, who sustains
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.440]   it and upholds it all by the word of his power, the marvel of the universe." But then he
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:19.680]   comes to a second conclusion, and that is the greatness and the uniqueness of man. "When
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:29.200]   I consider thy hymns, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained,
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:37.840]   what is man that thou art mindful of him? O the son of men that thou visitest him."
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.080]   He doesn't merely look and say, "How marvelous, how wonderful," and then go on to something
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:49.320]   else. He stops and thinks. "Here am I," he says, "looking at all that. Marvelous, wonderful,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:58.720]   the distances, the perfection of these laws. But who am I and what am I?" And he comes
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.200]   to a very profound conclusion concerning the greatness and the uniqueness of men. And here
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.320]   again, of course, is a fundamental difference between the non-Christian and the Christian
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.440]   attitude and outlook. The man of the world, he looks at all this and he says, "Isn't
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:23.480]   man wonderful, scientist, marvelous?" Then forgets all about it. He doesn't think any
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.120]   further. He doesn't think deeply, as I say. He doesn't consider. He doesn't ponder. He
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:38.440]   doesn't weigh and measure and draw conclusions. And I can prove this to you. You go to this
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:45.280]   non-Christian modern man, scientist or anything, and ask him what his view of men is, and he'll
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.680]   tell you. He'll tell you that man really is just an animal. Perhaps he's developed a part
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   of his brain more than most animals. But man, he says, is an animal. And what's he here
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.400]   for? Well, he's here to eat and drink and indulge in sex. That's what they're all doing.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.280]   That's what they believe. That's their view of men, and they're carrying it out in practice.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:14.760]   Man, just an accident, thrown out, result of some blind process of development and evolution.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:21.840]   But man is despised today. Man is looked down upon. Indeed, some of them do it in scientific
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   terms. They say, "Why do you make such a fuss about yourselves and your souls? Who are you?
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:31.960]   You're just little specks. You're just a little particle of dust in this great universe. And
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.200]   while these great developments are taking place, you meet in your little chapels and
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.080]   churches and look into your own souls and feel one another's spiritual pulses, you little
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:49.040]   people," they say. But you see their view of men? That's their view of men, that he's
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.120]   just an animal, governed by his instincts. And that's why you've got all the muddle and
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.400]   the confusion in the modern world, isn't it? It's the result of their view of men.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:06.080]   Oh, how different is the view of this man. He looks up into the heavens, he looks at
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.760]   the moon and the stars. He sees two men walking on the surface of the moon. He doesn't just
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.480]   say, "How marvelous," and then look at the next picture on the television and something
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:25.120]   low and something of evil and vice and forget all about. No, no. He considers it. "What
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.720]   is man?" he says. "Why? Well," he says, "because I know certain things about him.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.520]   Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.080]   honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.600]   of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea."
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.080]   At first when he looks up, he feels he's small and insignificant, and then he thinks
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.360]   again and he says, "I'm not." He says to me, "The amazing thing is this, that when
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.680]   I look at those vast distances, I feel small for a moment, but I know I'm not small,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   I'm bigger." He knows that he's a being created in the image and likeness of God.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.000]   He knows that God has endowed him with reason and understanding, the power of looking at
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.720]   himself objectively and self-examination and self-assessment. God has given him these powers,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.960]   he's made him lord of creation. He seems feeble when you put him by the side of a lion,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:40.640]   yet he can master the lion and control him, master the elements, master the force of gravity,
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:50.520]   master the pull of the moon. Man, the mightiest thing in the whole universe. What is man?
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.960]   What an amazing creature man is. Look at the way he discovers these laws. Look at the way
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.680]   he can harness them and put them into practice. Look at the technological developments. This
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.560]   little creature that seems so insignificant, is he but a reasoning animal? Is he just here
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.920]   to indulge his lusts and passions and excitements now and now? He's too big, he's bigger
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:21.360]   than the whole universe. Man. That's how this man thinks when he looks at the moon
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.920]   and the stars. He's made to ask questions, he reasons. My friends, did you do that? When
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:35.640]   you saw those two men walking on the surface of the moon, did you ask questions about yourself?
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.360]   Did you say, "What is man? What's he doing in this world? What's he meant for? What
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:47.160]   is he? Is he merely an accident? Is he merely something flimsy that can be carried about
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.840]   flotsam and jetsam?" And did you say, "No, no, man is made in the image and likeness
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:58.200]   of God. God called him and made him name the creatures. God gave him power over everything.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.760]   He's the master. He's the Lord of creation under God." Did it bring you to that conclusion?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.440]   Did you end by realizing your greatness, your uniqueness, your significance? Indeed, I can
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:22.080]   go further. Man, I say, is the most unique being in the whole cosmos. And there is no
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:28.480]   more important planet in the whole cosmos than this one on which you and I live. And
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:34.800]   its uniqueness derives from the fact that man is upon it. We used to hear a great deal,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.720]   didn't we, about people living on the surface of the moon and people living on the surface
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.480]   of Mars. But by now they're beginning to doubt it, aren't they? And I'll make a prophecy.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.640]   They'll never find any sentient beings on any other planet whatsoever. This is the one
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.080]   planet that matters. This is the one into which the Son of God came. And he came into
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:28:00.520]   it. Why? Because man is in it. Man is the most unique being in the whole universe. What
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   is man? There is nothing bigger than man, the supreme achievement of the Almighty God.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.200]   Tell me, as you looked at those two men walking on the surface of the moon, did it bring you
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:21.640]   to a realization of the greatness of your being, the majesty of man, the friend of God,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.520]   the companion of God, one whom God created that he might speak to him and have communion
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:34.040]   with him, one who corresponded to God, one who had something of the divine stamp upon
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.880]   him? That's the way in which the Christian thinks. You see, it's profound thinking.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:48.080]   But unfortunately we can't stop even at that. This man goes on to a third conclusion.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.800]   What is man? He says that thou art mindful of him, the Son of Man that thou visitest
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:01.320]   him. What's he mean? Well, I'll put this in the form of a principle. The problem and
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:08.680]   the tragedy of man. Oh yes, we've seen the uniqueness and the greatness of man, but we
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:18.160]   can't leave it at that, can we? The problem and the tragedy of man. What is man that thou
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:26.000]   art mindful of him, the Son of Man that thou visitest him? But why does God need to do
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.480]   this? Why has there ever been any necessity for this? And the answer is the extraordinary
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:41.080]   tragedy of man. When you looked at those men walking on the surface of the moon, did
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:47.120]   it bring you to a realization of the tragedy of man? What are you talking about, says someone?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.520]   Let me tell you. While I say that man is the greatest being in the universe, I say at the
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.240]   same time he is the most contradictory being in the universe. He's the most tragic being
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:04.720]   in the universe. Why? Well, because he's a mess of contradictions. Have you realized
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:12.560]   it? Let me show you some of them. Haven't you realized this about men? What an amazing
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:21.040]   success he can be. Yes, but at the same time, what a dismal failure he can be. There I saw
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:27.680]   it in one newspaper in America, the brilliant achievement of science. The indiscretion,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:37.120]   the trouble, the failures of an individual human being. Same paper, same prominence.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.440]   Isn't this the whole tragedy of the modern world? Look at the brilliance of men. He can
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:50.760]   defy the laws of gravity. He can harness the oceans and the air. He's master over these
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:57.000]   great powers. And not only that, look at the way he's prepared to deny himself in order
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.600]   to do this. Did you read about those astronauts? The self-discipline involved. They went without
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   drink, alcoholic drink. They went without smoking. They denied themselves lives with
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:15.000]   their families. Oh, the rigor of the self-discipline and the self-denial in order to make this
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.800]   possible and the brilliant achievement. They landed there and came back. Yes, but here
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:28.960]   in lies the tragedy that men with such a brilliant success in the matter of arriving at the surface
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.720]   of the moon, he doesn't know how to live. He can't be at peace with himself, not with
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:43.600]   his neighbor. He's a tragic failure. The world has never been in a greater agony. Oh,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.080]   yes, self-discipline in scientific achievement. Is there self-discipline in the married relationship?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.880]   Is there self-discipline between parents and children and children and parents? Is there
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:01.120]   the same self-abnegation, self-control and self-denial? No, no, this is the tragedy of
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:11.520]   the world. Brilliant success, abysmal, appalling failure. Brilliant achievement, terrible,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:20.720]   indescribable vice. The whole moral muddle of this world tonight, the tragedy of drug-taking
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.440]   and alcoholism and the breaking of all the sanctities and all the rules, the breakdown
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:33.120]   of marriage, the home, everything in the same world. What is man? What's the matter with
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.640]   him? Did you ask that question? Or did you merely look and say, "Isn't it marvelous?"
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.160]   Go on. My friends, that's the way the world doesn't think. But this man, governed by
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.760]   this teaching and this knowledge of God, he says, "I don't understand that man on the
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:56.440]   one hand can do all this, and yet he can't live. He's a fool, and he's a dismal failure."
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:03.360]   There's one of the contradictions, but let me give you another. Nothing is more characteristic
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.800]   of modern man than the fact that he is a hero worshipper. The great word of today is the
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:18.400]   word "personality," isn't it? Television personality generally means the absence of true personality.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:24.640]   But apart from that, personality, they'll stand for hours in the rain to see some great
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:32.440]   personality passing by, some film star or some other equally trivial person. Personality
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:44.200]   and the excitement interested in personality. And yet when you invite them to come to consider
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:53.160]   the greatest person that this world has ever known, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.000]   they feel insulted. They turn their faces away. They're not interested in him. That's
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:09.880]   your modern man. Hero worshipper, yet when he's faced with the person, the man, he doesn't
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.520]   recognize him. He doesn't know him. "Whom the princes of this world did not know," says
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:23.760]   Paul, "for had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." They
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.160]   dismissed him as this fellow, this carpenter, this ignoramus. There's the tragedy of men.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:35.800]   And let me give you one final example of this contradiction and this tragedy. Modern man,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.680]   as I'm saying, is very interested in great achievements and in great events. Oh, how
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:46.960]   excited he gets when one of these things is reported. Something unusual, something marvelous,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.240]   something strange. And yet when you ask him to consider the greatest events that have
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:02.000]   ever happened in this world of time, he couldn't care less. What are they? Well, we'll be celebrating
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.040]   one of them in our churches during these next weeks. The coming of the Lord of glory into
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:14.680]   this world of time and being born as a helpless babe. It's the most staggering thing that's
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:24.920]   ever happened. The world isn't interested. What else? Oh, the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:32.480]   When there in the middle of those three crosses I see one dying, innocent, dying for the guilty.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:39.640]   The perfect one dying for the lawbreakers and the vile. And likewise with the mighty
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:47.320]   fact of the resurrection. These are the greatest and most amazing things that have ever happened,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:53.480]   and yet the world isn't interested, passes them by, nuisance, nonsense, fairy tales.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:36:04.040]   Here, my friends, is the tragedy and the folly of men. What is men? Did you ask that question?
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.160]   When you looked at those two men walking on the moon, did you sit down and say, "I don't
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   understand this. I don't see how men can be so amazing and so wonderful, and yet his world
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.200]   is torn with wars. We've had two world wars in this century, and we've got iron curtains,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:24.320]   and we've got color bars, and we've got confusion and promiscuity. We've got trouble. The whole
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.680]   world is in an agony if men can do this. Why can't he live? Why can't he put his world
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:36.520]   in order? What's the matter with men?" Did you ask that question? If you didn't, you
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:41.440]   know you're not a thinker. You don't know how to think.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.080]   And then, you see, that leads you to a next question. Why is all this? What is the explanation
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:54.000]   of this amazing contradiction, success and failure? And you can search all the scientists
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.560]   and the scientific journals and books, and go to any scientist you know in the whole
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.360]   universe, and he won't be able to tell you. There's only one answer to that question,
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:10.200]   and it's the answer that's given in this book everywhere. It is this. Man is this unique
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:18.080]   being, made in the image and likeness of God, endowed with faculties and propensities second
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.160]   only to God himself. Well, then why is the world as it is? And there's only one answer,
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.680]   that man in his folly rebelled against God, pitted himself against God, said, "Why should
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.960]   I listen to God except to the suggestion of the tempter, and who says, 'As God said,
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.080]   if you only do what I tell you, you'll be equal to God.' And man wanted to be, and
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   so he fell. And his nature fell. And man ever since is a contradiction. He hasn't lost
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.720]   his faculties. They're there, but they're marred, and that explains his greatness. But
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:59.000]   he's also become a creature of lust and passion. Evil has entered into the very warp and woof
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.320]   of its constitution. He's a slave of the devil and the world and the flesh. And thus, you
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.520]   see, he's two, he's divided, he's quarreling, he's a contradiction. Great and small, success
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:21.400]   and failure, noble and ignoble and vile, and even worse than animals. My dear friends,
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   do these things as you look at them make you draw these conclusions? And did you get on
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:33.160]   your knees and cry out and say, "What's the matter with me? I'm a man, I'm one of them."
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   What is the problem? What's the cause of the tragedy? And that brings me to my last point,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:48.680]   this man's last point, and thank God for this. The contemplation of the moon and the stars
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:39:00.040]   and the heavens brings this man to the conclusion that there is only one hope for this world.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.680]   He's worked out the tragedy and the problem, the confusion and the shame and the failure,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:13.720]   and he knows that men can do nothing. But as he looks at the heavens and realizes that
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:19.400]   they're the works of God's fingers, and that he has been made by God, he knows, he comes
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.200]   to the conclusion there is only one hope for men, only one hope for the world. And my friends,
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   there is literally only one hope for this world tonight. Can education put this world
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:35.280]   in order? Well, read your newspapers tomorrow morning and you'll get your answer. Read,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.200]   look at the television tonight and you'll get your answer. We've multiplied our institutions
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.520]   since this chapel was founded a hundred years ago. Look at the new schools, primary, secondary,
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:56.080]   advanced, further education, libraries, universities, culture coming through the various media,
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:04.640]   newspapers, books, journals, articles. Never has man had such education, such opportunities.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.160]   Never has his world been in greater confusion and muddle. Never has it been in a position
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   of such terrible despair. There's only one hope for the world. Do you know what it is?
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:27.520]   What is man? That thou art mindful of him, that you think about him, that you're concerned
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:37.040]   about him, that you care for him. And the son of man, that thou visitest him, that thou
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.680]   hast visited him. The psalmist only saw it prophetically, he saw it coming. We look back
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:50.520]   upon it. The only hope for the world tonight, my dear friends, is this, that this is still
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:56.640]   God's world. He hasn't abandoned it. He hasn't turned his back on it. He hasn't forsaken
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.880]   it. He made it, he's still interested. He's still concerned. He's got a great plan for
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.720]   it, a plan of redemption and salvation. This is the Christian message. And he's put it
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:13.280]   into operation. God hath visited and redeemed his people, said old Zacharias. And this is
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.680]   the gospel. This is the unique message of the Christian church, to tell a world in despair
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.880]   that God is concerned that where those men have failed, that God is not only interested,
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.200]   he's made a plan and he's putting it into operation, it's successful. And because he's
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.760]   almighty, nothing can stop it, nothing can frustrate it. That thou art mindful of him
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:44.120]   and the son of man, that thou visitest him. The great story of the incarnation, the life,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.240]   the death, the resurrection of Christ, his heavenly session, and his coming again. Here
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:58.200]   it is. Shall I put this to you before I close? In very modern dress. We're all so scientific,
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:06.480]   aren't we? We're all interested in and authorities on launchings. We saw those two men, didn't
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.440]   we, those three men entering into a capsule. Then we saw them setting off a rocket. The
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:21.280]   launching day had arrived. And up they went and out through space and on and on and on,
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:30.200]   until eventually they landed on the surface of the moon. We're all interested in launchings.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:37.640]   Very well, my friend, let me put it to you like this. The only hope of the world tonight
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:46.400]   is because of certain launchings that have taken place. What are they? Let me tell you.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:56.120]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   under the law, to redeem them that were under the law. What is the Christian message? It's
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:12.240]   that nearly two thousand long years ago, God the Father put his only begotten son into
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:23.960]   a capsule, the virgin's womb, and launched him from eternity into time. God sent forth
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:31.800]   his son, rocketed him from the heaven and the glory into this world of time. And the
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:38.160]   son came out of the capsule, the virgin's womb, and walked on the face of this earth
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.120]   like the two men walking on the surface of the moon. They didn't belong to it. They'd
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.800]   never been there before. And here the son of men comes from the heavens and the glory
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   and lands on the surface of the earth and walks and lives amongst men and women like
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:44:01.080]   you and myself. That's the only hope for the world tonight. And why did he come? Did
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.040]   he merely come to collect a few specimens as they did and take them back for analysis?
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:13.600]   Thank God he didn't. Why did God send him? Why did God launch his son from heaven to
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.160]   earth? Why did the son enter the capsule and humble himself in doing so and be born as
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.680]   a helpless babe and laid in a manger? What's the meaning of it all? Why has he done this?
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:30.480]   What's he doing here? He tells us, "The son of man is come to seek and to save that
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.920]   which is lost." He came because he knew our condition, because he was mindful of us.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.880]   He's visited us because we are lost, we are damned, we are helpless, we are going
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:52.160]   to perdition and to hell. So he came and took upon him our human nature and was made even
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:45:00.240]   in the likeness of sinful flesh, was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.880]   And walked on the face of this earth and mixed with sinners and experienced their jealousy
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:14.920]   and envy and malice and spite and hatred. All that you and I might be forgiven, that
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.320]   God might adopt us into his family and make us his children and hold out before us the
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:29.600]   hope of everlasting joy and bliss, the launching, the coming, the incarnation. But there I say
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   he went to the cross. They crucified him and they thought they were being clever. Actually
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.320]   what was happening was that he was doing the thing he'd come to do. There was no way
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:48.040]   whereby God could forgive sinful men or reconcile men to himself except this one, that he lays
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:54.200]   our sins upon his son and punishes him for us, lays our guilt on him and strikes him
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:00.000]   and smites him with the stripes that we deserve. And he took it all, the Lamb of God that taketh
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.880]   away the sin of the world. But he died and they took down his body and they buried it
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.120]   in a grave and they rolled a stone over it and sealed it with a seal and put soldiers
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.720]   to guard it and then they rejoiced and said that's the end of him. That's the end,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.360]   he's finished. And if it had been the end, we wouldn't be here tonight. There'd be
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.240]   no gospel, there'd be no church, there'd be nothing and the world would be without
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:32.480]   any hope whatsoever. But we are here. Why? Well I'll tell you. Because of another launching.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:43.840]   There he is encapsuled in the grave. Do you know what happened? God put a rocket beneath
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:52.800]   it, the rocket of the resurrection. And he rose. He burst asunder the bends of death.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   He defied all the laws, even the last enemy. And he rose and he ascended and passed through
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:05.960]   the heavens and took his seat again at the right hand of the glory of God, the majesty
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:14.440]   on high, in the glory everlasting. He was launched again. The first launching from heaven
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:22.200]   to earth, the second from the depths of the grave back again through the heavens to the
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:30.760]   glory whence he had come. And there, my friends, he lives, he reigns, and all things are in
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.840]   his hands. All power, he says, is given unto me in heaven and in earth. The earth is and
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:42.160]   the world is not out of his hands. He is there, he lives, he reigns. And what is the hope
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:49.680]   for us? Oh, I'll tell you the hope. It's another launching that is yet to be. When again he'll
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:57.160]   be sent forth, no longer in the virgin's womb, no longer as the babe of Bethlehem, but now
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.920]   riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels, conquering and to conquer.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:08.440]   He will come again, visit this earth again, and come and judge it in righteousness. And
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:14.040]   all who are opposed to him, all his enemies, all evil, all sin, all who followed the devil
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:21.320]   and the way of the world, rather than this, will go to their final eternal perdition and
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   misery. But those who believed in him and have entrusted their souls to his safekeeping
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:39.680]   will be with him, will be made like him, and will spend their eternity in his glorious
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:47.360]   presence and even reign with him as kings and priests. That's the message. And it's
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:54.240]   all because God is mindful of us and because he's visited us because of these blessed
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:03.640]   launches. But I imagine someone saying, "That's all right, that sounds very interesting. But
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.360]   I really don't see what it's got to do with me. It's one point of view or another.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:13.960]   What's it got to do with me, my friend? I can tell you in a few closing words." What
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:21.920]   has this to do with you? Oh, I'll tell you. And I'll put it again in these same terms
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:31.240]   of launching. A day is coming, you know, when you are going to be launched. Where are the
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:36.320]   people who founded this church? They're no longer here, are they? Why not? They've been
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   launched out of it. And a day is coming when you are going to be launched out of this body
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:49.920]   in which you're living now. That'll be buried in a grave probably. But you will have been
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:58.200]   launched, you'll go out of it, and on and on you'll go. Your spirit. And you'll stand
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:05.640]   in the presence of God. You can't avoid it, you can't evade it. It's appointed unto us
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:12.120]   all. It's appointed unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment. It's no use
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.880]   you telling me about a National Health Service or about an affluent society and that you've
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.760]   never had it so good. My dear friend, you and I, like those people who founded this
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:29.240]   church a hundred years ago, have got to go. You've got to be launched out of this world,
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:35.480]   and you can't stop it. That's what all this has got to do with you. Tell me, when you
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.280]   saw those men being launched, did it remind you of the fact that you were going to be
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:48.840]   launched? Did you see there's a day coming when I'm going to be sent out like that? Now
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:58.280]   you see what that should lead us to consider? You remember in the case of those astronauts,
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:04.760]   great preparations had been made. The experiments had been going on for years, of course. Why?
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:10.240]   Because they knew perfectly well that when you put the force of a rocket beneath a capsule,
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.840]   can the capsule stand up to it? The stress and the strain, the heat, you've got to make
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:21.720]   sure that it'll stand it. Then as it goes up, the pull of gravity, then possible meteorites,
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.360]   then the blazing heat of the sun, and then when it gets to that point where gravity no
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.320]   longer pulls but the moon begins to pull, you've got to make your calculation. And they
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:39.160]   spent months and years in working out all these various details one by one, and so making
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:44.960]   absolutely sure that the three astronauts would be safe in their capsule and that the
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:54.800]   experiment would be a success. Those are the experiments and the calculations that they
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:04.720]   made. Tell me, my friend, have you made your calculations? Have you faced the fact that
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:11.600]   you are going to be launched? Have you made allowance for the stresses and the strains
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:20.400]   and the heat and the pulls? Tell me. Have you made preparation for the blazing heat
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:27.840]   of God's holiness and righteousness? You'll have to face it. The Ten Commandments, the
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:36.000]   moral law, the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus Christ, the saints, they'll all face it.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.120]   Have you made your calculations? Can you answer the questions of God when he'll tell you that
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:48.440]   he made you for this reason, that thou shouldest love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:53.240]   all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength and thy neighbor like thyself, not
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:59.940]   just to be nice and clean and decent and moral, but to live to the glory of God and for him?
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.120]   Have you faced the test? These are going to happen to you. You can't avoid it. You're
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:08.280]   going to be launched. You're going to die. And you've got to stand before God in judgment.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:14.160]   And there are the demands. There are the trials. There are the tests. Have you made your calculations,
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:22.200]   my dear friend? Why didn't you think of all that as you looked at these men and realized
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:30.240]   that they'd made all these calculations? This is wisdom, the wisdom that comes from God
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.840]   alone. And the man who doesn't make these calculations and preparations is nothing but
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:42.720]   an utter fool. Thinker, he doesn't know what thinking is. He's a fool.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.400]   And let me show you that there are two big differences between those astronauts and you
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:56.240]   and myself. And do you know what they are? Well, here's the first. Those men, as I've
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.000]   said, they made many experiments. And as you remember, some of them were not successful.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.920]   You remember reading once of three poor men who were put into the capsule and they were
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.160]   on the point of being launched, but they were burnt to death. The experiment had gone wrong.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.280]   But it didn't mean that the whole project had gone wrong. There were many failures.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.160]   And many experiments had to be repeated and corrected. And so, you see, trial and error
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.200]   on and on they went until at last they'd got it perfect and the men landed on the moon
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:33.120]   and came back. They could repeat the experiment and a failure didn't put an end to it. There
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:45.840]   was another chance. But my dear friend, you and I will never have a second chance. Our
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:56.240]   eternity is decided in this world. And if you go wrong here, you'll be wrong for all
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:04.280]   eternity. No second chance, no second experiment, no second opportunity. It is appointed unto
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:13.160]   all men once to die and after death the judgment. The only other difference is this. You remember
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:18.680]   that in the case of the astronauts, we were told six months at least before the time,
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.080]   the exact day on which they were going to be launched, the exact minute, and indeed
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:27.480]   they were clever enough to tell us the exact day and almost the exact minute on which these
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:31.680]   two men would land on the surface of the moon. You remember? They could tell us this six
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:40.280]   months ahead of time. They knew exactly. They could announce it and they did. And that's
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.840]   again a very vital sense in which we differ from them. They knew when they were to be
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:53.200]   launched. You and I don't know when we are to be launched. We are here today and gone
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:56:02.560]   tomorrow. Our times are in the hands of God. You never know when your launching is going
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   to take place. You don't know. It can happen tonight, tomorrow, any time. Our times are
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:15.880]   in his hands. Can't you see, my dear friend, that that should make you realize that this
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:21.200]   matter is very urgent? They knew they could look ahead. You don't. It can happen at any
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:26.240]   moment. Very well then, I say, shouldn't you take up this question immediately and try
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:31.160]   and find is there any way whereby I can be safe? Is there any capsule that I can enter?
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:36.520]   Is there anything that I can do in order that I may escape these tests and strains and trial,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:43.960]   the heat of God's holy law and his blessed righteousness? What can I do? And it's my
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   privilege to remind you of the old gospel that was preached here by the founder of this
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:56.440]   chapel, by the great Charles Haddon Spurgeon who helped them so much in the early days,
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:02.800]   and by all the preachers of the centuries back to the very apostles themselves. I can
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.240]   tell you, my dear friend, if you realize your predicament and feel that you're not ready
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.360]   and have made no preparation but may have to go at any moment, you say, "What can I
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:19.760]   do?" I can tell you. There's a capsule that has been prepared and all you have to do is
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:28.280]   to enter into it and you'll be absolutely safe. What is it? Oh, it's Jesus Christ. You
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:37.080]   enter into him. You believe on him and by believing on him you are in Christ. You just
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:42.600]   enter into the capsule. He'll take you as you are. You needn't go and wash and change
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:48.720]   and go through a process of depollution. No, no. Just as you are, he says, without one
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:58.720]   pre-come, he just asks you to step into the capsule. You're perfectly safe there, tempted
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:06.600]   in all points like as we are, yet without sin, already accepted of God, without spot,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:12.120]   without blemish. He's completed the work that God gave him to do. Nothing was able
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:17.560]   to bring a charge against him nor now, and in him you're safe. The righteousness of
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.880]   God, the law of God, yes, you can enter the capsule and start singing with Top Lady, "The
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:31.520]   terrors of law and of God with me can have nothing to do. My Savior's obedience and
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:40.680]   blood hide all my transgressions from view." My dear friend, this is the gospel, the message
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:51.640]   of the Christian faith. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be safe, safe
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:59:02.480]   in the arms of Jesus, safe on his gentle breast. Tell me, have you entered into this capsule?
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:07.600]   Have you recognized your sin, your failure, your condemnation, your hopelessness before
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:13.480]   God and death and the judgment and eternity? And have you realized that there's only
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:20.600]   one thing to do, to turn your back upon sin and shame and wrong and evil and the mind
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:28.280]   and the way of the world? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and enter into him. And you know
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:34.160]   once you're there, you'll be able to join in singing with some of the great saints of
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.760]   the centuries. Let me tell you one of them, Top Lady, this is how he put all this. And
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:53.360]   notice his words. "While I draw this fleeting breath, when mine eyes shall close in death."
[00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.320]   Then listen. "When I soar through tracts unknown." He's been launched. He's passing up. You see
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:08.560]   him going. "When I soar through tracts unknown, see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages,
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:16.440]   cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee." Now take another, a contemporary of his. They
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:23.240]   didn't agree theologically, but they agreed about this. Thomas Oliver's. "He by himself
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:36.960]   hath sworn, I on his oath depend. I shall on eagle's wings abhorn to him ascend. I shall
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:49.040]   behold his face, I shall his power adore and sing the wonders of his grace forevermore."
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:57.000]   Let me close with the same thing stated in the words of a woman, hymn writer. "All the
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:07.920]   way my savior leads me, all the fullness of his love. Perfect rest to me is promised in
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:17.880]   my father's house above." Then listen. "When my spirit, clothed immortal, wings its flight
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:31.560]   to realms of day, this shall be my endless story. Jesus led me all the way." My dear
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:44.360]   friend, are you in Christ? Are you encapsulated in the Lord Jesus Christ? It's the only place
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:52.680]   of safety if you've never entered in before. Enter in now. Whatever you are, whatever you've
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.320]   been, whatever you have done, it doesn't matter. I have his authority for saying this. "Him
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:14.040]   that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out. Enter in and be eternally safe." Amen.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
