[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   Billions of people suffer from stress
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.240]   and there are tools to combat stress
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.600]   that involve things like meditation, breath work,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.920]   good nutrition, good social connections
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.960]   and avoiding all bad things in life.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.680]   And while those are powerful,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.200]   the problem is they require that people step away
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.520]   from the stress inducing activity.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.640]   By contrast, my lab and other laboratories
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.420]   have been very interested in developing tools
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.660]   that allow us to push back on stress.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.640]   In other words, feel more calm in real time,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.600]   meaning without having to disengage
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900]   from the stress inducing activity.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.520]   The best way that I am aware to do that
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800]   is called the physiological sigh.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060]   A physiological sigh is a pattern of breathing
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.600]   that involves two inhales followed by an extended exhale.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.680]   Physiological sighs were discovered in the 1930s
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.880]   as a pattern of breathing that people go into spontaneously
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.040]   when they're in claustrophobic environments
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.160]   or in deep sleep when there's a buildup
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.180]   of a gas called carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.040]   Carbon dioxide triggers the impulse to breathe.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.200]   There are neurons in the brain
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.120]   that know when carbon dioxide levels have gotten too high
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.560]   and when the levels get too high,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.160]   they trigger inhale and exhale or double inhale and exhale.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   Now you can do physiological sighs voluntarily
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   anytime you're feeling too stressed
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.840]   and you want to feel more calm.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.960]   You do it like this.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.040]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.320]   So it's a double inhale
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.940]   and typically the first inhale is longer than the second,
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.800]   but the second one is still important to do
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.100]   and then a very long extended exhale.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.120]   Typically both inhales are through the nose
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.700]   and the exhale is through the mouth.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.600]   That's the most effective way to do the physiological sigh.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.880]   However, you can't breathe through your nose or your mouth
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   for whatever reason, do it all through your mouth
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.320]   or all through your nose.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   The second inhale is really important
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   because your lungs are not just two big bags of air,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.240]   they're two big bags of air with lots of little sacks,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260]   millions of sacks and if you were to lay out those sacks,
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.280]   their volume is as big as a tennis court
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.120]   and that allows both the intake of more oxygen,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.240]   but also the offload of carbon dioxide.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.260]   So when you do the double inhale,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.460]   it reinflates any of these little sacks that have collapsed
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.960]   and in doing so it allows you to offload more carbon dioxide.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   So if you're feeling stressed in any circumstance,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.760]   inhale twice through the nose
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.040]   and then exhale long through the mouth.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.760]   If you want, you can repeat it a second
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.400]   or even a third time, but typically just one or two,
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.920]   maybe three physiological sighs are sufficient
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.560]   to bring your level of stress and alertness down very fast
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   and allow you to feel more calm.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.320]   (silence)
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.480]   (silence)
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
