[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   We resume our study of this fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans after our
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   break of two Fridays by considering verses 18 and 19.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.160]   Verses 18 and 19 in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:33.000]   "Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.360]   by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men and to justification of
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   life.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.480]   For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.720]   many be made righteous."
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.360]   Now it's not inappropriate that we should find ourselves looking at these two verses
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.640]   after the break, because when we last met on the last Friday in March, we were dealing
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.960]   with the seventeenth verse, you remember, and at the end of that seventeenth verse in
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.320]   the authorized version, there is the end of a bracket.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.960]   The bracket starts, you remember, at the beginning of verse 13 and it ends here at the end of
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380]   verse 17.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.560]   So that this is a very convenient point at which to resume.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.560]   And let me remind you, therefore, as we do so, that these two verses are designed to
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   do two main things.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.960]   The first is they sum up and summarize what the apostle has been saying in the previous
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   verses.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   He has been working out an argument in detail in verses 13 to 17, but now, having done so
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   in detail, he puts it all before us as a conclusion, as a summary.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.120]   He states again the big principle that he was concerned to enunciate.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:18.840]   But we do remember, I trust, that these two verses subserve a second function, or if you
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.800]   prefer it, they are to be regarded in another way.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.440]   You remember that when we began the study of this great paragraph, beginning at verse
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   12 and going to the end of the chapter, we gave a kind of analysis of it, because it
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.880]   is most important that we should understand what the apostle is doing.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   It can be a very confusing passage unless we realize clearly how it is to be divided.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.700]   And you remember we said that this is what is happening.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.520]   He begins a statement in verse 12, "Wherefore, as by one man"—and then you expect him
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.100]   to go on and say "even so"—"as even so."
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.220]   But you remember that he never did that.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.300]   He never completed his statement, but he went on, "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.180]   into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all had sinned."
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.740]   Then you expect the other half, but it does not come there.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.860]   But instead you get this bracket in the authorized, this parenthesis.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:40.340]   And you remember that we have seen further that in verses 13 to 17 there are two parentheses.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.740]   The first one is in verses 13 and 14, where he simply explains and expounds that last
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.700]   statement in verse 12, namely that all sinned.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.420]   He wants to establish that.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.820]   It is such an important matter that he cannot just leave it like that, but he sets out to
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.140]   prove it and to demonstrate it by pointing out that until the law, sin was in the world,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.660]   and that death had passed on all, even between Adam and Moses, when there was no law, thereby
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.380]   not only proving the universality of death, but also the universality of sin, because
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.260]   death is the punishment of sin.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.340]   That is the meaning of that first parenthesis.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.900]   But then in saying that, he ended off by saying that the people who had never sinned after
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.220]   the similitude of Adam's transgression had nevertheless died, which you remember we interpreted
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   as referring in an especial way to infants who die before they have committed any voluntary
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.020]   act at all, but he puts it in terms of Adam's transgression, and at once he says, "Adam,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:59.180]   after all, was the type, or the shadow, or the figure, of him that was to come."
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.980]   Now having said that, he again has to qualify that, so you get your second parenthesis.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.180]   Adam is the figure of Christ, but in a very interesting way.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.580]   There is one big common feature, but in the main it is a question of contrast rather than
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.380]   of comparison.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.780]   He is the figure of Christ, but, says Paul, as you work it out in detail, what strikes
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:32.640]   you is the extraordinary contrast, and this much more of what God has done for us in Christ
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.580]   over and against what has happened to us in Adam.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.140]   Very well, by the end of the seventeenth verse he has finished that.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:50.820]   Verses 15, 16, and 17 are designed, in other words, to show that limit upon the comparison
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.340]   between our position in Adam and our position in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.060]   And he finishes it at the end of verse 17.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.900]   So now, having said all that, he can say, "Therefore," he is now going to come back
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.180]   to what he was setting out to say in verse 12.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.860]   But of course, having said what he said in verses 13 to 17, he still has it all in his
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.780]   mind, so that these two verses are, as I said, a summary of all the intervening argument
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.420]   as well as the full original statement which he intended to make.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:36.180]   Now, it is important, I say, that we should bear that in mind, so that we can see how
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.700]   he is summing it all up in these two verses.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.980]   Here, he really is saying again and laying down this big principle that he was anxious
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.160]   to inculcate.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.540]   But here again you notice an interesting thing.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.140]   He says it in two verses and not in one.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.980]   He says it, in a sense, in two different ways instead of one.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.860]   And there surely must be some reason for that.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.180]   And it seems to me that the reason for that is that he wants to emphasize particularly
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540]   what he says in verse 19.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.860]   Verse 19, you notice, follows from verse 18.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.260]   It begins with the word "for."
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.020]   It's the kind of explanation of 18.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:31.700]   Therefore, this is really the big thing that he wants to underline and to emphasize.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.740]   Very well, then, what is the statement?
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.820]   As we look at it, once more I must remind you of something that I trust you've not
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:52.220]   forgotten, that the whole object of this paragraph, as indeed the whole object of the entire chapter,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:08:01.540]   is just to show us the completeness and the finality of justification by faith.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:09.260]   Justification by faith is something that leads to certain inevitable results.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.820]   That's what he's setting out to prove.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.460]   He started off, you remember, by saying, "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:22.100]   God, we stand in this grace into which we have had access, and we rejoice in hope of
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.460]   the glory of God."
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.260]   And he's been going on with that same statement.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.420]   Verses 9 and 10, "Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.780]   from wrath through him.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.220]   If while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.020]   being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:53.340]   It's the certainty, the absolute certainty of it all.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.020]   Justification is the profoundest truth, therefore, that we can ever grasp.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:05.140]   But what the Apostle is concerned about is that we should see that if we are justified,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:14.100]   our final salvation is sure and certain, and nothing can ever rob us of it or stand between
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.540]   us and it.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   And he will go on saying this and arguing it until he comes to that terrific climax
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.660]   at the end of chapter 8 when he says, "I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.540]   principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:36.300]   any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300]   Jesus our Lord."
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.580]   Who are the "us"?
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.700]   Well, those who are justified in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:49.380]   The great theme of chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 is assurance of salvation.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.900]   And we must never forget that and must not allow ourselves, as we saw, in a special way,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.900]   to be misled by some of these so-called Bibles that have their subdivisions and say that
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.460]   he takes up sanctification of chapter 5 in verse 12 and so on.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   No, no.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.100]   It is assurance of salvation.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.780]   It is the certainty and the finality of it all in the case of those who are justified.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.780]   Very well.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:25.580]   And, of course, in a special way in this section, his argument is that it is certain and sure
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.700]   because we are in Christ.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.540]   We are in his life, as he puts it in verses 9 and 10 at the end.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   If so much has happened to us by his death, how much more by his life?
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.300]   We are in his life.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.300]   We are in Christ.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.860]   Now, then, that is the background to this great statement.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.060]   And I am again emphasizing it, as the apostle himself does.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.820]   You see, he has made it perfectly plain, I would have thought, but still he says it once
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   more.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.820]   He sums it up.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.100]   He repeats it in verses 18 and 19.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.100]   Why?
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.180]   Well, for this reason.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:11.100]   From the experimental standpoint, from the standpoint of our happiness and joy while
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.180]   we are still left in this world, nothing is more important than the grasping of this particular
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.180]   truth.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.900]   This is the way to have assurance of salvation.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.940]   And it was because the apostle was so anxious that they should have it that he thus works
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.520]   it out in detail with them and then repeats it and underlines it and reemphasizes it.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.980]   So the principle we carry in our minds is this, that while it is, of course, perfectly
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:50.540]   true to say that God does deal with us individually in this matter of salvation, we must never
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:12:01.460]   lose sight of the fact that God deals with us federally, in a united manner, and thus
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.620]   parts of a whole.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.460]   The Lord Jesus Christ, as it were, died for his people.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.420]   We are made parts of this people, but it is for his people.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.780]   We have already seen, you remember how, the parallel is this, that what Adam did led to
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.180]   certain results to his people.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.500]   What Christ has done leads to results to his people.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:35.660]   So we must get hold of this idea of our belonging to a people, and that as Adam was our federal
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:43.180]   head, so the Lord Jesus Christ is the federal head and representative of his people.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:49.580]   Now that is Paul's argument here, that God has always dealt with mankind in this federal
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.340]   manner.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.020]   He has always dealt with mankind through a head and through a representative.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.760]   It was in Adam; it is now in Christ.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.620]   So what he is going to work out again and put before us is the difference between our
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.340]   being in Adam and our being in Christ.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.260]   Very well, let's look at it.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.420]   First of all, we look at what has happened to us in Adam.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:29.720]   Here he puts it like this in verse 18, "Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.420]   all men to condemnation."
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:38.220]   Now you will notice, probably in your Bibles, that certain words are in italics, because
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.620]   they are not there in the original.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.460]   They have been supplied by the translators in order to make the understanding plain and
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.460]   clear.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.260]   And of course, they are of great value and they are undoubtedly right.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:57.140]   But actually Paul wrote, "Therefore, as by the offense of one upon all men to condemnation."
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   And in the same way, in the second half, the translators have supplied the words, "The
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.220]   free gift came upon."
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:13.300]   What Paul wrote was, "Even so, by the righteousness of one unto justification of life."
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.700]   But that is all right; that is purely a technical point.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:29.660]   What the apostle is saying then is this, "Because of that one sin of Adam, the whole of mankind
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.500]   are treated as sinners."
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.020]   That is the saying; that is what he is telling us here.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:41.220]   Now that is the thing he said originally in verse 12, "By one man sin entered into the
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:50.900]   world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men for that all sin."
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:15:00.980]   Here he is saying it again now, "As by the offense of one judgment came upon all men
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.880]   to condemnation."
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:13.300]   Because of that one sin of Adam, we are all under judgment, and it is a judgment of condemnation.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:21.720]   We are all treated as sinners, and the judgment and the punishment that comes upon such sinners
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.940]   has been pronounced upon all.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:30.900]   Now that is his first statement in verse 18, but let us take with it the first part of
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.900]   verse 19.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:42.340]   "For," he says, "as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners."
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:48.580]   Now here is an important statement, because this goes further than the statement in verse
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.580]   18.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:59.900]   Verse 18 says that because of this one offense of Adam, that all were treated as sinners.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   This goes further, and it says that all were not only treated as sinners, but all were
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.660]   regarded as sinners.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:13.620]   In other words, his expression is, you notice, "made sinners."
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.660]   Now this is an important word, the word "made."
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.980]   I referred to it many Friday nights ago, but I must remind you of it because it is a vital
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.140]   part of this argument.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:34.260]   This word translated here as "made" is much stronger than the word "made" suggests.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   What does it mean?
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.340]   Well, it means this.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:49.460]   It means to sit down in the rank of, or to place in the category of, or to appoint to
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.700]   a particular class.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.940]   Now let me give you an illustration.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.420]   You remember how in the twelfth chapter of Luke's Gospel we are told that when our Lord
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.100]   was preaching on one occasion, he seemed to stop for a moment, and a man shouted out,
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.900]   saying, "Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me."
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.700]   We are told that our Lord looked upon this man and said, "Man, who made me a judge or
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.340]   a divider over you?"
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.660]   Who made me a judge or a divider over you?
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.180]   Now that is the word that is used here.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.180]   What does "make" mean?
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.180]   Well, it means this.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.820]   Who has appointed me?
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.700]   Who has designated me as a judge or a divider?
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:38.340]   Who has put me into the category or into the class of a judge?
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.740]   That is what our Lord said.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.840]   Now that is exactly the meaning here, and it is very important, obviously, that we should
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.100]   grasp this meaning.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:57.980]   So what the apostle says is that by one man's disobedience, many were constituted sinners.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.180]   And again, I must emphasize the word "sinners."
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.580]   He does not say that many were constituted sinful.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.900]   Oh no, not the possibility.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.820]   Many were constituted sinners.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.740]   He does not use an adjective.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.940]   He uses a noun.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.940]   He does not say that because of Adam's disobedience, the whole of mankind was made sinful and therefore
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.820]   liable to sin, and because they were liable to sin, they sinned, and because they sinned,
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.820]   they were then punished.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.260]   That is not what he says at all.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:41.780]   He says that because of this one disobedience of Adam, all were constituted sinners, made
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.540]   sinners, regarded by God as sinners.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:52.100]   Now you will see the importance of emphasizing this, because the second half of this nineteenth
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:59.140]   verse says that on the other hand in Christ we have been made or constituted righteous,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.540]   and you have got to give it the same force and the same meaning on the two sides.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.780]   Therefore if we do not give it its full force here, how can we give it its full force there?
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:18.500]   Therefore I say that he is asserting that because of Adam's one act of disobedience,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:27.780]   the whole of the human race has been constituted legally as sinners.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:33.220]   We have all been put into the category of sinners.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:39.220]   We are all regarded personally and individually as sinners.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.780]   That is, if you like, our judicial standing before God.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   Because of that one sin of Adam, we were all put into the category of sinners.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.900]   Now I believe I used an illustration before in an attempt to make this plain and clear.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:05.580]   It is this kind of thing.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.460]   That other country may very well declare war against this country, and though you and I
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.380]   have not committed the misdemeanor, we suffer the consequences.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:21.180]   The other country declares war, and we therefore legally in international law have been constituted
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.300]   enemies of that country, though we have done nothing at all.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.860]   It is a judicial procedure.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:33.580]   Now that is the kind of thing the apostle is saying, that our standing before God judicially
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.420]   became that of sinners.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:48.420]   And notice, we became sinners not by any personal act on our part at all, but entirely and solely
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.740]   by that one man's disobedience.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.220]   Now those who have been attending here regularly will have seen how the apostle has kept on
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.860]   repeating this in almost every single verse from verse 12 until this point.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.740]   He goes on repeating it and repeating it, because it is clearly the big thing that is
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.380]   in his mind.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.660]   You remember how we saw in verses 13 and 14 that how he finally clinches the statement
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.140]   is by taking the case of infants.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.860]   Why should infants die?
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.260]   And his answer is that death is always the punishment of sin.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.660]   Therefore if an infant dies, it is dying because it is guilty of sin, but the infant has done
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.980]   nothing.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.980]   Why therefore should it die?
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.180]   What is it being punished for?
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.660]   How has the punishment taken this form in that case?
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:45.980]   And the answer is, he says, there is only one explanation, that all sinned in Adam.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.260]   Now let us be clear about this.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.460]   I have already made it plain that it does not mean to say that every infant who dies
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.220]   of necessity goes to hell.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.740]   But it does mean that every infant who dies has been constituted a sinner.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.760]   That God may apply his redeeming grace is another matter.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:12.180]   What we must grasp is that everybody since Adam, including infants, have all been constituted
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.740]   and put into the category of sinners.
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:22.780]   Very well then, we are not sinners because we have a sinful nature and because we commit
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.180]   acts of sin.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.940]   It is the other way around.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:35.220]   It is because we are sinners that we have this sinful nature and commit acts of sin.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:45.580]   What he asserts is that by the one disobedience of Adam, the whole of mankind has been constituted,
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.380]   put into the category of sinners.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.820]   The sinful nature, the depravity, the pollution, and the sinful acts are simply part of the
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.020]   punishment that has followed.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.540]   It is the form that the punishment has taken.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:08.540]   What is really vital is that we should see that we are all sinners in Adam and because
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.860]   of Adam's one act of disobedience.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.380]   No, this is God's judicial act.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.820]   God made men and he decided to appoint Adam as the representative of the entire human
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   race.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.380]   It is a perfect right to do so and he did so.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.860]   And he decreed that the whole of humanity should be there represented and should suffer
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.420]   the consequences of that man's actions.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.900]   And that is what happened.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:40.420]   When Adam sinned, God therefore did what he said he would do and he constituted all the
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:45.060]   progeny of Adam as sinners.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:52.420]   We all sinned in Adam and with him because he was our federal head and representative
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.540]   and therefore God pronounced us all to be sinners.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:03.620]   Now, says the apostle, this is a fact and you cannot dispute it because you are confronted
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:11.180]   by the fact of the universality of sin and the fact of the universality of death.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:18.260]   How can you explain the universality of sin and the universality of death except in terms
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:25.100]   of this great and tremendous fact that we all sinned in Adam and were pronounced to
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.060]   be sinners by God?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.500]   Now then, there is the one side.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.220]   But thank God we can turn to the other side.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.300]   That is what happened to us in Adam.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.040]   What happens to us in Christ?
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.140]   Now then, listen to this.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.100]   This is the thing the apostle wants to bring out, you see.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.900]   This is the assurance he wants to give them.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.500]   So what he is saying in effect is this.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:59.940]   As all that has happened to you in Adam is a fact, realize, says Paul, that all that
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.140]   has happened to you in Christ is also a fact.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.220]   If that was absolutely certain, realize that this is equally certain and more so because
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.380]   here is God's grace coming in and not his wrath and not his judgment.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.220]   That is his argument.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.340]   So you see why he takes the trouble and why I have tried in my small way to take the trouble
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.100]   of underlining and emphasizing this great fact.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.740]   It was there because of that one disobedience of Adam that we were made sinners and it is
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:37.980]   a fact about the whole of the human race, all who belong to Adam.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.340]   Look at the other side, he says.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.260]   Look at this other fact.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:48.420]   Look what is true of all that are in Christ and see that it is equally certain and equally
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420]   a fact.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   What is it?
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:58.700]   Well, he says, it all comes out of the obedience of this other one.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:08.780]   All that we derive as benefits of salvation come to us solely and entirely because of
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.300]   the obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.380]   Our salvation is entirely in him.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:25.180]   As my being made a sinner came entirely from Adam, all my righteousness and my being a
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.900]   Christian comes entirely from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.780]   In other words, if you want to have assurance of salvation, the place to start is not with
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.700]   your feelings but with your understanding.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.780]   Then the feelings will follow.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.300]   The way to get assurance is not to try and feel something, but it is to grasp this objective
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.520]   truth.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.980]   See yourself in Adam.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.740]   Though you have done nothing, you are declared a sinner.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.740]   See yourself in Christ.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.060]   Though you have done nothing, you are declared to be righteous.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.460]   That is the parallel.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.100]   So that we get rid of all our actions, there is no bursting.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.460]   We do nothing at all.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.260]   It is all the obedience of the one.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:18.940]   Now, I don't tarry tonight as I would like to, to work out this obedience.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.540]   I take it we are all clear about this.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.100]   His active obedience, he was made of a woman.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.620]   Yes, he was made under the law.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:37.820]   He came under it, he who in a sense had made it, put himself under it in order to redeem
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.300]   us.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:45.540]   The law of God has got to be satisfied, it has got to be honored, it has got to be vindicated.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:51.340]   And he, having come on earth to redeem men and to rescue them, had to honor the law.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.620]   So he gave an active obedience to the law.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.940]   You remember what happened at his baptism?
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.660]   Why do you come and seek baptism of me, said John the Baptist to him?
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.980]   I ought to be baptized by you.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:13.900]   No, no, said our Lord, suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.900]   righteousness.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.980]   He has put himself under the law.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.300]   He has put himself in our position.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.980]   He is our head and representative.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.700]   And the law is there, and it demands to be kept, so he kept it.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.980]   He never failed in any jot or tittle.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:37.820]   He rendered a perfect and a full obedience to God's holy law, active obedience.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.780]   And then look at his passive obedience, there upon the cross.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.700]   Oh, you remember the struggle in the garden?
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:53.020]   Father, he says, if it be possible, let this cup pass by, nevertheless not my will but
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.020]   thine be done.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.020]   What's this?
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.500]   Well, it was this question, you see, of submitting passively to have the sins of men put upon
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.380]   him and to bear their awful punishment and separation from his Father.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.180]   He says, is there no other way?
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.220]   If there isn't, I'm going on.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   Passive obedience.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.500]   And he went as a lamb led to the slaughter.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.740]   He gave himself in this passive obedience.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.180]   He didn't resist.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.260]   He didn't object.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   Your sins were laid upon him and he bore them.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.540]   He bore the pain and the suffering.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.920]   He made the atonement.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.860]   He endured the wrath of God against sin.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.180]   That's his passive obedience.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.620]   He was perfectly obedient as a lamb led to the slaughter.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.660]   He went.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.780]   His obedience was active.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.020]   His obedience was passive.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:54.820]   And it is this obedience of his, says the apostle, that has had this tremendous effect
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.500]   upon us and has led to these extraordinary results.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.500]   What are they?
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.900]   Well, here's the first.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.420]   Verse 18, justification of life.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   What's this?
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.300]   Well, you see, this is the thing he's been talking about rarely since the seventeenth
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.140]   verse of the first chapter.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.260]   Justification of life.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.940]   The just shall live by faith.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.540]   The just by faith shall live.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.540]   What's this?
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:30.220]   Well, this is God forgiving us entirely, blotting out our transgressions.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.500]   More, it is God pronouncing us righteous.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:43.260]   More, it is now being delivered from the whole realm of death in which we were held.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.980]   You remember how we worked that out in verse seventeen?
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.980]   For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:56.300]   of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.740]   Justification isn't merely a forgiveness of sins.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.980]   No, no.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.540]   We are finished with the realm of death.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.840]   We are in life.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.620]   We are reigning in life.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.120]   We belong to the whole realm and territory of life.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.620]   We have everlasting life and we look forward to an eternal hope.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:21.940]   But then in verse nineteen he states it still stronger, you remember.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:29.540]   For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.740]   many be made righteous.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:35.340]   Yes, these are the people who belong to Christ, these who are made righteous, these who believe
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.340]   in him.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.980]   They are made righteous.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:48.540]   Believe to the word made, its full content, constituted, put into the category of, judicially
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.540]   regarded as.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.020]   That is what it means, as it meant on the other side.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:32:01.120]   Now this, he said, is what has happened to all of us, we are in Christ and it happens
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.260]   to us because and on the grounds of his obedience alone.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.500]   Of course, this was the great theme of the apostle.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.180]   Did you notice it there in 2 Corinthians 5.21?
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:20.300]   For he, God, hath made him to be sin for us that knew no sin.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   Why?
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:28.460]   In order that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:34.340]   There it is again, the same thing exactly as he is saying in these two verses.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.020]   Let me then put it to you once more in this way.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:47.260]   As we were constituted sinners because of Adam's one sin, and apart from any action
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:58.180]   on our part, so we are constituted righteous entirely apart from anything that we do or
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:04.300]   anything that may be or has ever been true of us.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:13.860]   It is entirely and only and solely because of Christ's obedience.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.940]   That is the great principle.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.860]   That is why he brought in this paragraph at all.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.500]   He says, "Now you used to be there in Adam, you are now in Christ.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.580]   All that was true of you because of that one act of Adam, all this is true of you because
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.740]   of this obedience of Christ.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.620]   But do let us realize what it brings us.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:45.220]   We are not only forgiven, we are regarded as righteous.
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.580]   We are constituted as righteous persons.
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:55.660]   I emphasize that Paul did not say that we were constituted sinful, we were constituted
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.060]   sinners, sinners as persons.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:06.700]   Here, on the other hand, we must realize that it means that we are regarded as righteous
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.500]   persons.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.580]   God puts us into the category, into the class of righteous people.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.020]   He looks at us as if we had never sinned at all.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.500]   That is what the apostles say.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.380]   We are finished with that old position.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.140]   We are no longer sinners.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.260]   We have been taken out of that class, we have been put into this class.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:36.520]   We are amongst the redeemed, the righteous, righteous persons, constituted righteous.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.500]   We are taken, I say, right out of the realm of death.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.220]   Death has no more dominion over us in that sense.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.460]   It has become sleep to us.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.820]   We belong to the realm of life.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.420]   That is the thing the apostle wants us to understand.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.620]   That is the assurance.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.620]   And it is all true, you see, because we are not merely forgiven and regarded as righteous,
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:12.840]   but more, and it makes it still more certain, we are in Christ.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.180]   We belong to him.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:21.380]   Our relationship to him is the same as was our relationship there to Adam at the beginning.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.900]   And it is a definite effect and it is a certain.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.420]   So we are in Christ.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.580]   Now then, let me again put it in this form.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:39.260]   We must not think of our salvation in too atomistic a manner.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.580]   We must get hold of this idea that our salvation is entirely in Christ.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.320]   And what saves us is that we are put into him.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.180]   We must not, as it were, think of God dealing with us one by one in this matter, and that
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.660]   there is a separate act of salvation in each one.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.660]   Not at all.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.060]   It was all done there once and forever.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:04.260]   And if I am put into Christ, I was crucified with him, I died with him, I am risen with
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   him, I am in the heavenly places in him, I am even Christ.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.340]   That is the way to look at it.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:17.420]   And as we look at it like that, our certainty and our assurance can never be shaken.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.980]   Listen to Paul putting it again in the first epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.980]   in the thirtieth verse.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:35.900]   But he says, "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness,
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.100]   sanctification, redemption."
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.680]   You see, it is all in him.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.320]   And if I am in him, it all becomes mine.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.000]   Has that sin of Adam led to all this in my case?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.400]   So that obedience of Christ leads to all this in my case.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:58.040]   And if I am in Christ at all, he is not only my justification, not only my righteousness,
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.440]   but also my sanctification, and also my final redemption.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.080]   I cannot take parts of Christ.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.920]   He is a whole Christ, and if I am in him, all his benefits come to me.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.080]   That is the argument.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:19.000]   I am regarded by God as a righteous person because I am in Christ.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.480]   I am constituted righteous.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:32.800]   And as it is God who has done all this, as it is God who has constituted me a righteous
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:43.680]   person, even as he formerly had constituted me a sinner, as it is God's own judicial
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:55.720]   act, obviously my salvation must be certain and secure, and nothing can ever upset it.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:00.640]   If God has made a judicial pronouncement with respect to me that because I am in Christ
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:09.960]   that he regards me as a righteous person, well, I am a righteous person.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.800]   And I will go further.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.320]   I shall always be a righteous person.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.480]   "Ah, but," says someone, "what if you sin tomorrow?"
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.160]   I am still a righteous person.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.000]   The fact that I sin tomorrow does not mean that I go back and am now in Adam as I was
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   before.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.200]   You cannot go back and forth.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.840]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:39.480]   We are either in Adam or else we are in Christ.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.720]   And as he will go on to show us at the end in the next two verses and then in chapters
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:52.440]   six and seven, "Though I may sin in Christ, I do not go back under the law.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.200]   I have finished with that forever.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.000]   All things are passed away.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.040]   Behold, all things have become new."
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.520]   And that is one of the most important.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.480]   The Christian in that sense has finished with law.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.400]   He is no longer under the law.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.200]   That does not mean that he has not got to keep it, but he is not under it.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.000]   Oh, I do trust that this is becoming plain and clear to us.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.480]   I am constituted a righteous person.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.760]   That is how God regards me.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.280]   I am now in his family.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.360]   I am now his child.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:36.040]   And when I sin now, I am not sinning against law; I am sinning against love.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.120]   It is no longer the action of a criminal; it is the action of a child.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.560]   It is in the relationship of love that we now fail.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.720]   The whole thing is different.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.600]   I do not cease to be a righteous person.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.200]   Though I am an unworthy one, I am still a righteous person.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.840]   God has declared it, he has established me there, he has put me into the category.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.000]   And you cannot pass in and out of the category.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.480]   Can you not see how monstrous the thing is?
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.760]   That at one moment you are amongst the righteous, and the next moment you are in Adam, back
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.000]   and forth.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   The thing is ridiculous.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.280]   And of course it is not true.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:18.160]   When God makes this pronouncement, this declaration, when God constitutes us righteous in this
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.240]   way, I say, "We are righteous.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:29.520]   We are in Christ, and that is our new position.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.240]   And no man shall ever be able to pluck us out of his hands, and nothing shall ever be
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:42.560]   able to separate us from that love of his which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:49.160]   Now then, there is the great statement which the apostle makes in these two momentous verses.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:55.000]   It is the summing up, I say, of it all.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:07.440]   "As because you were in Adam, his act of disobedience led to all that, so even so."
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:18.360]   Because you are in Christ, his obedience, and his obedience alone, leads to these inevitable
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.160]   consequences.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.840]   Whatever you and I may do, listen, says the apostle to the Corinthians, every man's work
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.960]   is going to be judged at the end.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.440]   And if a man has been building with wood and hay and stubble and so on, it will all be
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440]   burnt up.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.880]   There will be nothing left.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.240]   Yet he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   But he is saved.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.760]   He is a righteous person.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.360]   His work is all burnt up.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.940]   He will suffer loss.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.940]   But he is saved.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.120]   He is a righteous person.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.440]   So all his building has been useless and does not stand.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.160]   He himself stands.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:01.960]   Saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.480]   Here is the assurance that you and I should possess.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.400]   That is why the apostle wrote all this.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.760]   That is why he goes on repeating it.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.960]   He wants to bring it home to us.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:18.240]   Why do you think he goes on repeating this statement which he made in verse 12, that
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.280]   it was that one sin of Adam that caused us all to sin?
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.840]   Why does he go on repeating it?
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.920]   Why does he put it in this utterly explicit manner in this 19th verse, where he says,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.560]   "We were constituted sinners"?
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.280]   Why is he so concerned to press that upon us?
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.040]   To me there is only one adequate explanation.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.440]   It is that we may see so clearly the other side.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.320]   He says it is as definite and as certain.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:59.440]   If you are in Christ, the consequences of his obedience are as certain and as sure,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.600]   even more so, much more.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   And they are this justification of life.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.440]   You are being put into the category of the righteous.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   You are being in Christ and in the very life of Christ.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:29.840]   Join to him the living head, one of his people, and your eternal future is safe and secure,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.520]   and nothing can ever rob you of it.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:41.720]   So there, I say, is the argument of these two momentous verses.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:47.000]   May I suggest this as I close?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.560]   That the way to test whether you have really followed the argument or not is this.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.440]   Are you certain and sure of your salvation?
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.640]   Or do you still want to go on saying, "Oh, I wouldn't like to say that, you know, because
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.200]   I can't trust myself, and I may sin tomorrow and next year."
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.880]   The moment you begin to say that, you are just telling me you haven't followed the
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.160]   argument.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:22.640]   Your salvation and mine depends only and entirely and exclusively upon the obedience of Christ.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.800]   "Oh," says someone, "isn't that inviting us to go and commit sin?"
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.040]   You know, that's exactly what people were saying about Paul.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.640]   That's the first verse of the sixth chapter, isn't it?
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.600]   "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.000]   In other words, if you do not sound as if you were preaching antinomianism, you're
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.960]   not preaching the gospel.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   The gospel sounds dangerous, but of course it isn't dangerous, because the men who is
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.560]   in Christ will not argue like that.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.880]   The men who is in Christ will see this wondrous thing, will be so amazed, will so rejoice
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.240]   in it, that he will double his efforts in order to be worthy of it.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.280]   He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.440]   It works the other way around.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.960]   Very well then, I leave the question with you.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.320]   Have you followed the argument?
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.880]   Have you really seen yourself in Christ?
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.160]   Don't look at yourself.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.080]   Look at yourself in him, because that's where you are.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   You've been put there.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   You've been engrafted.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.520]   You're in him, and therefore you're constituted a righteous person.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.680]   That's how God looks at you.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.800]   God no longer looks at you as a sinner and as you were in Adam.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.880]   That's the whole point.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.040]   And you must never look at yourself as a sinner again.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   You're not a sinner.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.680]   You're a child of God.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:53.560]   You're a child of God, who fails and who falls, but you're not a sinner any longer.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.580]   You're not a miserable sinner.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:00.600]   And if a Christian calls himself a miserable sinner, he's denying this whole argument.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:08.640]   He was a miserable sinner, but he's now a righteous person.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:14.200]   And when he fails and falls, he's doing so in the realm of the family, in the realm of
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   love.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.800]   But thank God he doesn't change his position.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.640]   His standing isn't changed.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.480]   The relationship is not changed.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.640]   Look at it all exclusively, entirely in Christ.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.980]   Even as before, it was all entirely and exclusively in Adam and his one transgression.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.760]   I don't know whether you feel like I feel.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.320]   I want to thank God that he ever, by the Spirit, led the Apostle Paul to emphasize this point
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:53.540]   about Adam and Christ and the fact that we all were made sinners because of Adam's sin.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.040]   It enables me to look on the other side and to say, "Very well, I am righteous in spite
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:04.560]   of all I know to be true about myself because I am in Christ.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.720]   I'm no longer a sinner.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   I have been constituted a righteous person."
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   Amen.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:25.240]   O Lord, our God, we feel that our words are inadequate and our feelings are puny.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:32.200]   We desire to lift up our hearts in praise as we contemplate the wonders of thy grace
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.720]   and this marvel of our redemption.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:41.320]   O God, we see that nothing else could have saved us, that merely to give us the opportunity
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.360]   would not have availed us.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.600]   We should have failed as Adam did at the beginning, but thou, O God, hast made it certain by putting
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.680]   it all in him and then by putting us into him.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:00.720]   O by thy Spirit we pray thee that we all may see this glorious truth so clearly that we
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:07.200]   may rejoice in our salvation and have the blessed assurance and walk through this sinful
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:15.160]   world as realizing that we are thy people, citizens of thy kingdom, members of thy family
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:22.440]   and household, destined certainly for the glory that thou hast prepared for us.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:29.080]   O Lord, enable us to receive it in all its fullness and its glory.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:36.200]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:43.680]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:52.200]   of this our short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and until we shall have arrived
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:58.200]   safely at home and in glory.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.960]   Amen.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
