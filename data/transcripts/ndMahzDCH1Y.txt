[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   The following is a conversation with Louise and JoÃ£o Botala,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   brothers and co-founders of Fermat's Library, which is an incredible platform for annotating papers.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.880]   As they write on the Fermat's Library website, "Just as Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.920]   last theorem in the margins, professional scientists, academics, and citizen scientists
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.400]   can annotate equations, figures, ideas, and write in the margins."
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.000]   Fermat's Library is also a really good Twitter account to follow. I highly recommend it.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.840]   They post little visual factoids and explorations that reveal the beauty of mathematics. I love it.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   Quick mention of our sponsors. Skiff, SimpliSafe, Indeed, NetSuite, and 4Sigmatic.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.880]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.280]   As a side note, let me say a few words about the dissemination of scientific ideas.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.320]   I believe that all scientific articles should be freely accessible to the public. They currently
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.480]   are not. In one analysis I saw, more than 70% of published research articles are behind a paywall.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.640]   In case you don't know, the funders of the research, whether that's government or industry,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.000]   aren't the ones putting up the paywall. The journals are the ones putting up the paywall,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.480]   while using unpaid labor from researchers for the peer review process.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   Where is all that money from the paywall going? In this digital age, the costs here should be
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   minimal. This cost can easily be covered through donation, advertisement, or public funding of
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.120]   science. The benefit versus the cost of all papers being free to read is obvious, and the fact that
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.640]   they're not free goes against everything science should stand for, which is the free dissemination
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.560]   of ideas that educate and inspire. Science cannot be a gated institution. The more people can freely
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.160]   learn and collaborate on ideas, the more problems we can solve in the world together, and the faster
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.080]   we can drive old ideas out and bring new, better ideas in. Science is beautiful and powerful,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   and its dissemination in this digital age should be free. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.960]   and here's my conversation with Luis and Joao Batalla. Luis, you suggested an interesting idea.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   Imagine if most papers had a backstory section, the same way that they have an abstract. So,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.720]   knowing more about how the authors ended up working on a paper can be extremely insightful.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   And then you went on to give a backstory for the Feynman QED paper. This is all in a tweet,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.320]   by the way. We're doing tweet analysis today. How much of the human backstory do you think is
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.680]   important in understanding the idea itself that's presented in the paper or in general?
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.800]   - I think this gives way more context to the work of scientists. I think a lot of people have this
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.320]   almost kind of romantic misconception that the way a lot of scientists work is almost as the sum of
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   eureka moments where all of a sudden they sit down and start writing two papers in a row,
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.440]   and the papers are usually isolated. And when you actually look at it, the papers are chapters of a
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   way more complex story. And the Feynman QED paper is a good example. So, Feynman was actually going
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   through a pretty dark phase before writing that paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   physics problems. And there was one time when he was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.720]   that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed that when the plate was in the air, there
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he also noticed that the Cornell symbol was
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of motions of those plates. And that
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.520]   led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in relativity, which led to
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   about quantum electrodynamics. So, that kind of reignited his interest in physics,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.560]   and ended up publishing the paper that led to his Nobel Prize, basically. And I think
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.160]   there are a lot of really interesting backstories about papers that readers never get to know.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.640]   For instance, we did a couple of months ago an AMA around a paper, a pretty famous paper,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.160]   the Gans paper with Ian Goodfellow. And so, we did an AMA where everyone could ask questions
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.240]   about the paper, and Ian was responding to those questions. He was also telling the story of how
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.760]   he got the idea for that paper in a bar. So, that was also an interesting backstory.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:00.080]   I also read a book by Cedric Villani. Cedric Villani is this mathematician, a Fields Medalist.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.480]   And in his book, he tries to explain how he got from a PhD student to the Fields Medal,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.840]   and he tries to be as descriptive as possible, every single step, how he got to the Fields Medal.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.200]   And it's interesting also to see just the amount of random interactions and discussions with other
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.040]   researchers, sometimes over coffee, and how it led to fundamental breakthroughs in some of his
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.280]   most important papers. So, I think it's super interesting to have that context of the backstory.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.680]   - Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting, and perhaps that's true for Feynman
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   as well. I don't know if it's romanticizing the thing, but it seems like just a few little
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.440]   insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required. Do you have a sense that for a lot
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:50.880]   of the stuff you've looked at, just looking back through history, it wasn't necessarily the grind
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.120]   of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat's Last Theorem, for example. It was more like a brilliant
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.760]   moment of insight. In fact, Ian Goodfellow has a kind of sadness to him almost, in that at that
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.680]   time in machine learning, like at that time, especially for GANs, you could code something
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.960]   up really quickly on a single machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.000]   validation in like a single night, a single person could do it. And now there's kind of a sadness
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.320]   that a lot of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:37.120]   experiments. So it was almost like the early days. So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.200]   in science and mathematics and even engineering where it's like, you could do that little
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.760]   experiment quickly. Like you have an insight in a bar. Why is it always a bar? But you have an
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:55.040]   insight at a bar and then just implement and the world changes. It's a good point. I think it also
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.400]   depends a lot on the maturity of the field. When you look at a field like mathematics,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   like it's a pretty mature field. A field like machine learning, it's growing pretty fast.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.200]   And it's actually pretty interesting. I looked up like the number of new papers
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.920]   on archive with the keyword machine learning and like 50% of those papers have been published
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.440]   in the last 12 months. So you can see just the sense-
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.160]   Five zero?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:31.440]   Five zero, 50%. So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field. And so I think like
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:39.040]   as fields mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent. It's just
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.160]   a consequence of that. The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.760]   really make it more memorable in a way. And by making it more memorable, it kind of sediments
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.960]   the knowledge more in your mind. I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, right? Where he came up with it essentially while he was
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.680]   sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam. And he came up with that algorithm over 20 minutes.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.920]   And one interesting aspect is that he didn't have any pen or paper at the time. And so he had to do
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   it all in his mind. And so there's only so much complexity that he can handle if you're just
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.000]   thinking about it in your mind. And that like when you think about the simplicity of Dijkstra's
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.480]   shortest path finding algorithm, it's knowing that backstory helps sediment that algorithm
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.280]   in your mind so that you don't forget about it as easily.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.520]   It might be from you that I saw a meme about Dijkstra.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   It's like he's trying to solve it and he comes up with some kind of random path. And then
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.280]   it's like my parents aren't home. And then he does, he figures out the algorithm for the shortest
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:57.520]   path. He's trying through words to convey memes, but it's hilarious. I don't know if it's in post
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.400]   that we construct stories that romanticize it. Apparently when Newton, there was no apple.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.160]   Especially when you're working on problems that have a physical manifestation or a visual
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   manifestation, it feels like the world could be an inspiration to you. So it doesn't have to be
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.120]   completely on paper. Like you could be sitting at a bar and all of a sudden see something in a pattern
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.440]   will spark another pattern and you can visualize it and rethink a problem in a particular way.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.560]   Of course, you can also load the math that you have on paper and always carry that with you.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.720]   So when you show up to the bar, some little inspiration could be the thing that changes it.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.640]   Is there any other people almost on the human side, whether it's physics with Feynman,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.600]   Dirac, Einstein, or computer science, Turing, anybody else? Any backstories that you remember
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   that jump out? Because I'm also referring to not necessarily these stories where something
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.160]   magical happens, but these are personalities. They have big egos. Some of them are super friendly.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   Some of them are self-obsessed. Some of them have anger issues. Some of them, how do I describe
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.040]   Feynman? But he appears to have appreciation of the beautiful in all its forms. He has a wit
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.400]   and a cleverness and a humor about him. So does that come into play in terms of the construction
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:30.000]   of the science? - I think you brought up Newton. Newton is a good example also to think about his
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.600]   backstory because there's a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about, but then
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.920]   there's a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was. But he was
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   really into alchemy. And he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing about it. And he
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.160]   took it very seriously. He was really into Bible interpretation and trying to predict things based
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.040]   on the Bible. And so there's also a whole backstory then. And of course, you need to look at it in the
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:07.280]   context and the time that when Newton lived, but it adds to his personality. And it's important to
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:14.880]   also understand those aspects that maybe people are not as proud to teach to little kids, but
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.760]   it's important. It was part of who he was and maybe without those, who knows what he would have
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.400]   done otherwise. - Well, the cool thing about alchemy, I don't know how it was viewed at the time,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.400]   but it almost like to me symbolizes dreaming of the impossible. Like most of the breakthrough
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.040]   ideas kind of seem impossible until they're actually done. It's like achieving human flight.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.120]   It's not completely obvious to me that alchemy is impossible or like putting myself in the mindset
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:53.520]   of the time. And perhaps even still, everything that, some of the most incredible breakthroughs
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:03.200]   would seem impossible. And I wonder the value of believing almost like focusing and dreaming
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   of the impossible such that it is actually is possible in your mind and that in itself manifests,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.800]   whether the accomplishing that goal or making progress in some unexpected direction. So alchemy
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.920]   almost symbolizes that for me. - I distinctly remember having the same thought of thinking,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.240]   when I learned about atoms and that they have protons and electrons, I was like, okay, to make
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.800]   gold, you just take whatever has an atomic weight below it and then shove another proton in there
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.920]   and then you have a bunch of gold. So like, why don't people do that? It seemed like conceptually
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.800]   is like, this sounds feasible. You might be able to do it. - And you can actually, it's just very,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.440]   very expensive. - Yeah, yeah, exactly. So in a sense, we do have alchemy and maybe even back
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.800]   then it wasn't as crazy that he was so into it, but people just don't like to talk about that as
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.520]   much. Yeah, but Newton in general was a very interesting fella. - Anybody else come to mind?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:06.880]   In terms of people that inspire you, in terms of people that you just are happy that they have once
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   or still exist on this earth. - I think, I mean, Freeman Dyson for me. Yeah, Freeman Dyson was,
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.680]   I've had a chance to actually exchange a couple of emails with him. He was probably one of the
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.360]   most humble scientists that I've ever met and that had a big impact on me. We were trying,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:33.200]   we're actually trying to convince him to annotate a paper on Fermat's library and I sent him an email
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:40.080]   asking him if he could annotate a paper and his response was something like, I have very limited
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.360]   knowledge. I just know a couple of things about certain fields. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.120]   do that. That was his first response. And this was someone that should have won a Nobel Prize
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.440]   and worked on a bunch of different fields, did some really, really great work. And then just
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.640]   the interactions that I had with him, every time I asked him a couple of questions about his papers
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:09.280]   and he always responded saying, I'm not here to answer your questions. I just want to open more
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:17.200]   questions. And so that had a big impact on me. It was like just an example of an extremely humble
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:25.680]   yet accomplished scientist. And Feynman was also a big, big inspiration in the sense that he was
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.080]   able to be, again, extremely talented and scientist, but at the same time, socially,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.560]   he was able to, he was also really smart from a social perspective and he was able to interact
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:45.520]   with people. He was also a really good teacher and was also to, did awesome work in terms of
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:52.400]   explaining physics to the masses and motivating and getting people interested in physics.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.760]   And that for me was also a big inspiration. - Yeah, I like the childlike curiosity of some
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.920]   of those folks, like you mentioned, Feynman. I have Daniel Kahneman, I got a chance to meet
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.320]   and interact with. Some of these truly special scientists, what makes them special is that even
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:18.000]   in older age, there's still that fire of childlike curiosity that burns. And some of that is like
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.880]   not taking yourself so seriously that you think you've figured it all out, but almost like thinking
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:31.680]   that you don't know much of it. And that's like step one in having a great conversation or
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.240]   collaboration or exploring a scientific question. It's cool how the very thing that probably earned
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:46.320]   people the Nobel prize or work that's seminal in some way is the very thing that still burns even
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:53.120]   after they've won the prize. It's cool to see. And they're rare humans, it seems. - And to that
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   point, I remember like the last email that I sent to Freeman Dyson was like in his last birthday,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.600]   he was really into number theory and primes. So what I did is I took like a photo of him,
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.880]   picture, and then I turned that into like a giant prime number. So I converted the picture into a
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.800]   bunch of one and eights, and then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.440]   And then I sent him that. - Oh, so the visual, like it still
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.760]   looked like the picture, it was made up of a prime. That's tricky to do. That's hard to do.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.920]   - It looks harder than it actually is. So the way you do it is like you convert the darker regions
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.200]   into eights and the lighter regions in ones. And then there's- - And then you just keep flipping
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.080]   numbers until- - Yeah, but there's like some
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.000]   primality tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint. But what it tells you is
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   it excludes numbers that are not prime. Then you end up with a set of numbers that you don't know
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.200]   if they are prime or not. And then you run the full primality test on that. So you just have
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.160]   to keep iterating on that. And it's funny because when he got the picture, he was like, "How did
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.840]   you do that?" He was super curious too. And then we got into the details. And again, it was already
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:12.160]   90, I think 92 or something. And that curiosity was still there. So you can really see that in
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.000]   some of these scientists. - So could we talk about Fermat's library?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.280]   - Yeah, absolutely. - What is it? What's the main goal?
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   What's the dream? - It is a platform for annotating papers
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:32.000]   in its essence. And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there and
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.800]   generally pretty hard to understand at times. And the idea is that you can make them more accessible
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.680]   and easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the side. And so we can just
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.000]   imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side. And then when you
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.600]   click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.680]   And so the idea is that you can say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   that is not completely obvious, or you can add more context to it. And then over time,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:12.640]   papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way. But it really came from
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:19.600]   myself, Luis and two other friends. We've had this long running habit of kind of running a
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.720]   journal club amongst us. We come from different backgrounds. I studied CS, we studied physics. And
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.320]   so we'd read papers and present them to each other. And then we tried to bring some of that online.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:39.200]   And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library. And then over time, it kind of
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:48.480]   grew into something with a broader goal. And really what we're trying to do is trying to help
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   move science in the right direction. That's really the ultimate goal and where we want to take it now.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.600]   So there's a lot to be said. So first of all, for people who haven't seen it,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   the interface is exceptionally well done. Execution is really important here.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.560]   Absolutely.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.400]   The other thing is just to mention for a large number of people, apparently, which is new to me,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.600]   don't know what LaTeX is. So it's spelled like latex. So be careful googling it if you haven't
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.640]   before. It's a, sorry, I don't even know the correct terminology.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.280]   Type setting language?
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:32.240]   It's a type setting language where you're basically writing a program that then generates
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.880]   something that looks from a typography perspective, beautiful.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.840]   Absolutely.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.640]   And so a lot of academics use it to write papers. I think there's like a bunch of communities that
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.200]   use it to write papers. I would say it's mathematics, physics, computer science.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   That's, yeah. That's it.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.400]   That's the main-
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.360]   Because I'm collaborating currently on a paper with two neuroscientists from Stanford.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.240]   And they don't know what.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:07.600]   So I'm using Microsoft Word and Mendeley and like all of those kinds of things.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.200]   And I'm being very Zen like about the whole process, but it's fascinating.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:20.160]   It's a little heartbreaking actually, because it actually, it's funny to say,
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.120]   but we'll talk about open science, actually the bigger mission behind it for Mars Libraries, like
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.480]   really opening up the world of science to everybody.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   Is these silly two facts of like one community uses LaTeX and another uses Word,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   is actually a barrier between them.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.440]   It's like boring and practical in a sense, but this makes it very difficult to collaborate.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.720]   Just on that, I think that if there are some people that should have received like a Nobel
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.920]   Prize, but will never get it. And I think one of those is like Donald Knuth because of tech
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:02.560]   and LaTeX then, because it had a huge impact in terms of like just making it easier for
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.680]   researchers to put their content out there, like making it uniform as much as possible.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.000]   Oh, you mean like a Nobel Peace Prize?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.600]   Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.120]   Maybe a Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah, I think so.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.440]   I mean, he had a very young age, got the Turing Award for his work in algorithms and so on.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.760]   So like an incredibly, I think it's in, it might be even the sixties, but I think it's the seventies.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:34.480]   So when he was really young and then he went on to do like incredible work with his book and yeah,
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.320]   with tech that people don't know.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.360]   And going back just on the reason why we ended up, because I think this is interesting.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.560]   The reason why we ended up using the name Fermat's Library, this was because of Fermat's
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.440]   Last Theorem. And Fermat's Last Theorem is actually a funny story. So Pierre de Fermat,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:59.120]   he was like a lawyer and he wrote like on a book that he had a solution to Fermat's Last Theorem,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.520]   but that didn't fit the margin of that book.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.720]   And so Fermat's Last Theorem basically states that there is no solution.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.480]   If you have integers a, b and c, there's no solution to a to the power of n plus b to the
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   power of n equals to c to the power of n if n is bigger than two. So there's no solutions.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:30.560]   And he said that, and that problem remained open for almost 300 years, I believe. And a lot of the
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.680]   most famous mathematicians tried to tackle that problem. No one was able to figure that out until
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.920]   Andrew Wiles, I think was in the nineties, was able to publish the solution, which was, I believe,
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:49.200]   almost 300 pages long. And so it's kind of an anecdote that, you know, there's a lot of knowledge
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.520]   and insights that can be trapped in the margins, and there's a lot of potential energy that you
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:03.920]   can release if you actually spend some time trying to digest that. And that was the origin story for
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.000]   the name. - Yes, you can share the contents of the margins with the world.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.360]   - Exactly. - That could inspire a solution
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.640]   or a communication that then leads to a solution. - And if you think about papers, like papers are,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.080]   as JoÃ£o was saying, probably one of the densest pieces of text that any human can read. And you
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.680]   have these researchers, like some of the brightest minds in these fields, working on like new
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.800]   discoveries and publishing these work on journals that are imposing them restrictions in terms of
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.400]   the number of pages that they can have to explain a new scientific breakthrough. So at the end of
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:46.320]   the day, papers are not optimized for clarity and for a proper explanation of that content,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.200]   because there are so many restrictions. So there's, as I mentioned, there's a lot of potential energy
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.120]   that can be freed if you actually try to digest a lot of the contents of papers.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.240]   - Can you explain some of the other things? So margins, librarian, journal club?
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.600]   - So journal club is what a lot of people know us for, where we, every week, we release an
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.760]   annotated paper and in all sorts of different fields, but physics, CS, math. Margins is kind of
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   the same software that we use to run the journal club and to host the annotations, but we've made
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:25.760]   that available for free to anybody that wants to use it. And so folks use it at universities and
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:33.440]   for running journal clubs. And so we've just made that freely available. And then librarian is a
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.560]   browser extension that we developed that is sort of an overlay on top of archive. So it's about
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:46.480]   bringing some of the same functionality around comments, plus adding some extra niceties to
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.200]   archive, like being able to very easily extract the references of a paper that you're looking at,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.640]   or being able to extract the BibDeck in order to cite that paper yourself. So it's an overlay on
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.280]   top of archive. - The idea is that you can have that commenting interface without having to leave
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.680]   archive. - It's kind of incredible. I didn't know about it. And once I learned of it, it's like,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:14.240]   holy shit, why isn't it more popular given how popular archive is? Like everybody should be
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.560]   using it. Archive sucks in terms of its interface. Or let me rephrase that, it's limited. Yeah.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.600]   - Yeah. - In terms of its interface.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.880]   - Archive is a pretty incredible project, right? And it is, in a way, it's, you know,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.760]   the growth has been completely linear over time. If you look at like number of papers published on
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.480]   archive, like, you know, it's pretty much a straight line for the past 20 years. Especially
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.840]   if you're coming from a startup background and then you were trying to do archive,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.600]   you'd probably try to like all sorts of growth acts and like try to then maybe like have paid
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.360]   features and things like that. And that would kind of maybe ruin it. And so there's a subtle
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.280]   balance there. And I don't know what aspects you can change about it.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   - Yeah. For some tools in science, it just takes time for them to grow. Archive is just turned 30,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.440]   I believe. And for people that don't know, archive is this kind of online repository where people put
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.800]   preprints, which are versions of the papers before they actually make it to journals.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.320]   - ARXIV. - Exactly.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.280]   - For people who don't know. And it's actually a really vibrant place to publish your papers and
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.800]   in the aforementioned communities of mathematics, physics and computer science.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.400]   - It started with mathematics and physics. And then over the last 30 years, it evolved. And now
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.080]   actually computer science now, it's a more popular category than physics and math on archive.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.520]   - And there's also, which I don't know very much about like a biology, medical version of that.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.560]   - BioRxiv. Yeah, BioRxiv. - More recent.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.320]   - It's interesting because if you look at like these platforms for preprints,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.800]   they actually play a super important role. Because if you look at a category like math,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   for some papers in math, it might take close to three years after you click upload paper on the
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.720]   journal website and the paper gets published on the website of the journal. So this is literally
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:26.400]   the longest upload period on the internet. And during those three years, that content is just
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.560]   locked. And so that's why it's so important for people to have websites like ARXIV so that you
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.440]   can share that before it goes to the journal with the rest of the world. That was actually on ARXIV
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.240]   that Perelman published the three papers that led to the proof of the PoincarÃ© conjecture.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.440]   And then you have other fields like machine learning, for instance, where the field is
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.960]   evolving at such a high rate that people don't even wait before the papers go to journals before
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.200]   they start working on top of those papers. So they publish them on ARXIV, then other people
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.800]   see them, they start working on that. And ARXIV did a really good job at like building that core
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.240]   platform to host papers. But I think there's a really, really big opportunity in building more
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.520]   features on top of that platform, apart from just hosting papers. So collaboration, annotations,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:23.440]   like having other things apart from papers like code and other things. Because, for instance,
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.000]   in the field like machine learning, there's a really big... As I mentioned, people start working
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.960]   on top of preprints and they are assuming that that preprint is correct. But you really need a
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.280]   way, for instance, to maybe... It's not peer review, but distinguish what is good work from
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.960]   bad work on ARXIV. How do you do that? So like a commenting interface like Librarian, it's useful
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:53.440]   for that so that you can distinguish that in a field that is growing so fast as machine learning.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.040]   And then you have platforms that focus, for instance, on just biology. BioARXIV is a good
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:07.520]   example. BioARXIV is also super interesting because there's actually an interesting experiment
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:16.400]   that was run in the '60s. So in the '60s, the NIH supported this experiment called the Information
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:24.320]   Exchange Group, which at the time was a way for researchers to share biology preprints via mail
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.800]   or using libraries. And that project in the 1960s got canceled six years after it started. And it
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.080]   was due to intense pressure from the journals to kill that project because they were fearing
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:46.640]   competition from the preprints for the journal industry. Creek was one of the famous scientists
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.040]   that opposed to the Information Exchange Group. And it's interesting because right now, if you
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.600]   analyze the number of biology papers that appear first as preprints, it's only 2% of the papers.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:06.400]   And this was almost 50 years after that first experiment. So you can see that pressure from
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:14.160]   the journals to cancel that initial version of a preprint repo had a tremendous impact on the
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   number of papers that are showing up in biology as preprints. So it delayed a lot that revolution.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.040]   But now platforms like BioRxiv are doing that work. But there's still a lot of room for growth
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.000]   there. And I think it's super important because those are the papers that are open,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.600]   that everyone can read. - Okay, so but if we just look at the entire process of science as a big
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:43.280]   system, can we just talk about how it can be revolutionized? So you have an idea, depending
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.040]   on the field, you wanna make that idea concrete, you wanna run a few experiments in computer science,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:58.000]   there might be some code, there'd be a data set for some of the more sort of biology, psychology,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.720]   you might be collecting the data set, that's called a study, right? So that's part of that,
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.360]   that's part of the methodology. And so you are putting all of that into a paper form.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:20.400]   And then you have some results. And then you submit that to a place for review through the
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:25.680]   peer review process. And there's a process where, how would you summarize the peer review process,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.040]   but it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment and based on that,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.840]   decide whether your paper is good or not. So there's a whole broken nature to it. At the same
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:46.800]   time, I love the peer review process when I buy stuff on Amazon, for like the commenting system,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.440]   whatever that is. So, okay, so there's a bunch of possibilities for revolutions there. And then
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.720]   there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.880]   people commenting sort of the low effort collaboration, which is a comment. Sometimes
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.400]   as you've talked about, a comment can change everything, but, or a higher effort collaboration,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.000]   like more like maybe annotations or even like contributing to the paper. You can think of like
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.920]   a collaborative updating of the paper over time. So there's all these possibilities for
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:29.200]   doing things better than they've been done. Can we talk about some ideas in this space,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.400]   some ideas that you're working on, some ideas that you're not yet working on, but should be
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:41.120]   revolutionized? Because it does seem that archive and like open review, for example,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:49.840]   are like the Craigslist of science. Like, yeah, okay. I'm very grateful that we have it, but it
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.400]   just feels like it's like 10 to 20 years. Like it doesn't feel like that's a feature. The simplicity
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:05.200]   of it is a feature. It feels like it's a bug. But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:13.040]   the same kind of simplicity to it. And it seems to work exceptionally well in the crowdsourcing
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.400]   aspect of it. So, sorry, there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table. Let's just pick random
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.840]   things that we can talk about. - Wikipedia, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.680]   I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists. Because if
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   someone had pitched me Wikipedia, like a publicly edited encyclopedia, like a couple of years ago,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.280]   like it would be, I don't know how many people would have said that that would have survived.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.840]   - I mean, it makes almost no sense. It's like having a Google doc that everybody on the internet
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.240]   can edit. And like, that will be like the most reliable source for knowledge.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.880]   - I don't know how many, but hundreds of thousands of topics. - Yeah. It's insane.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.960]   - It's insane. And then you have users, like there's a single user that edited one third
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.520]   of the articles on Wikipedia. So we have these really, really big power users. They are
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:16.640]   a substantial part of like what makes Wikipedia successful. And so, like, no one would have ever
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:23.680]   imagined that that could happen. And so that's one thing. I completely agree with what you just said.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.880]   - Sorry to interrupt briefly. Maybe let's inject that into the discussion of everything else.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.120]   I also believe, I've seen that with Stack Overflow, that one individual or a small collection
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:42.000]   of individuals contribute or revolutionize most of the community. Like if you create a really
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:50.960]   powerful system for archive or like open review and made it really easy and compelling and exciting
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.840]   for one person who is in like a 10X contributor to do their thing, that's going to change everything.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.240]   It seems like that was the mechanism that changed everything for Wikipedia. And that's the mechanism
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.760]   that changed everything for Stack Overflow is gamifying or making it exciting or just making it
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:15.280]   fun or pleasant or fulfilling in some way for those people who are insane enough to like answer
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.920]   thousands of questions or write thousands of factoids and like research them and check them,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.120]   all those kinds of things, or read thousands of papers. - Yeah. No, Stack Overflow is another
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:34.080]   great example of that. And it's just, and those are both two incredibly productive communities
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:43.520]   that generate a ton of value and capture almost none of it. And in a way it's almost like counter,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:51.120]   it's very counterintuitive that people, that these communities would exist and thrive.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:57.840]   And it's really hard to, there aren't that many communities like that.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.800]   - So how do we do that for science? Do you have ideas there? Like what are the biggest
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.960]   problems that you see? Are you working on some of them? - Just on that, there are a couple of
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.680]   really interesting experiments that people are running. An example would be like the polymath
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.600]   projects. So this is a kind of a social experiment that was created by Tim Gowers,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.560]   Fields medalist. And his idea was to try to prove that is it possible to do mathematics in a
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:32.240]   massively collaborative way on the internet? So he decided to pick a couple of problems and test
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.080]   that. And they found out that it actually, it is possible for specific types of problems,
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:44.320]   namely problems that you're able to break down in little pieces and go step by step. You might need,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.960]   as with open source, you might need people that are just kind of reorganizing the house every
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   once in a while. And then people throw a bunch of ideas and then you make some progress, then you
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.920]   reorganize, you reframe the problem and you go step by step. But they were actually able to prove
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:11.040]   that it is possible to collaborate online and do progress in terms of mathematics. And so I'm
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.760]   confident that there are other avenues that could be explored here. - Can we talk about peer review,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.400]   for example? - Absolutely. I think like in terms of the peer review, I think it's important to look
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:30.320]   at the bigger picture here of like, of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.640]   Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process. So if you
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:43.520]   look at, for instance, at what publishing means in like a traditional journal, you have journals that
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:52.400]   pay authors for their articles, and then they might pay like reviewers to review those articles.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:59.680]   And finally, they pay people to, or distributors to distribute the content. In the scientific
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.800]   publishing world, you have scientists that are usually backed by government grants, they are
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.160]   giving away their work for free in the form of papers. And then you have other scientists that
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.640]   are reviewing their work. This process is known as the peer review process, again for free. And
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:27.040]   then finally, we have government backed universities and libraries that are buying back all that work
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.240]   so that other scientists can read. So this is, for me, it's bizarre. You have the government that is
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.560]   funding the research, is paying the salaries of the scientists, is paying the salaries of the
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:43.600]   reviewers, and it's buying back all that product of their work again. And I think the problem with
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:51.040]   this system, and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium, is because of
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.720]   the way academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life. And so,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:06.320]   in a lot of fields, the competition in academia is really insane. So you have hundreds of PhD
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   students that are trying to get to a professor position, and it's hyper competitive. And the
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   only way for you to get there is if you publish papers, ideally in journals, with a high impact
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.240]   factor. In computer science, it's often conferences that are also very prestigious, or actually more
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.120]   prestigious than journals now. Okay, interesting. So that's the one discipline where, I mean,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.960]   that has to do with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:45.520]   But like, NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least,
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.840]   as prestigious as the journals. But yeah, but doesn't matter. The process is what it is.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.080]   So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:02.400]   citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal. But so, you can
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:10.480]   really think that the problem with the impact factor is that it's a way to turn papers into
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:18.880]   accounting units. And let me unpack this, because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:24.560]   So because papers are born with impact, even before anyone reads them. So the researchers,
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:30.400]   they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper is going to ever have a long-term impact
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.680]   on the world. What they care, their goal, their end goal is the paper to get published.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:42.480]   So that they get that value up front. So for me, that is one of the problems of that. And that
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.240]   really creates a tyranny of metrics. Because at the end of the day, if you are a dean, what you
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.600]   want to hire is like people, researchers that publish papers on journals with high impact
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.400]   factors, because that will increase the ranking of your university and will allow you to charge
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:06.720]   more for tuition, so on and so forth. And that, especially when you are in super competitive areas,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   that people will try to gamify that system and misconduct starts showing up.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:19.920]   There's a really interesting book on this topic called Gaming the Metrics. It's a book by a
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:27.440]   researcher called Mario Biagioli. It goes a lot into like how the impact factor and metrics
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.400]   affect science negatively. And it's interesting to think, especially in terms of citations,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.280]   if you look at the early work of like looking at citations, there was a lot of work that was
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.560]   done by a guy called Eugene Garfield. And this guy, the early work in terms of citation, they
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.600]   wanted to use citations as from a descriptive point of view. So what they wanted to create was
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:56.080]   a map. And that map would create a visual representation of influence. So citations
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:02.560]   would be links between papers. And ideally what they would show, they would represent is that you
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.920]   read someone else's paper and it had an impact on your research. They weren't supposed to be counted.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.720]   I think this inspired like Larry and Sergey's work, right? For Google.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.680]   Exactly. I think they even mentioned that. But what happens is like, as you start counting citations,
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:24.240]   you create a market. And the same way, like, and this was the work of Eugene Garfield was a big
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.960]   inspiration for Larry and Sergey for the page rank algorithm that led to the creation of Google.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.400]   And they even recognized that. And if you think about it, it's like the same way there's a gigantic
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:45.360]   market for search engine optimization, SEO, where people try to optimize the page rank and how a
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   web page will rank on Google. The same will happen for papers. People will try to optimize
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:57.440]   the impact factors and the citations that they get. And that creates a really big problem.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.960]   And it's super interesting to actually analyze them. If you look at the distribution of the
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.760]   impact factors of journals, you have like nature with nature, I believe it's like in the low 40s.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.480]   And then you have, I believe science is high 30s. And then you have a really good set of good
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:23.040]   journals that will fall between 10 and 30. And then you have a gigantic tale of journals that
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:31.520]   have impact factor below two. And you can really see two economies here. You see the universities
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.920]   that are maybe less prestigious, less known, that where the faculty are pressured to just
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.960]   publish papers, regardless of the journal, what I want to do is increase the ranking of my
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:49.200]   university. And so they end up publishing as many papers as they can in journals with low impact
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:57.520]   factor. And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the global South. And then you have the luxury
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.360]   good economy. So for instance, and there are also problems here in the luxury good economy.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.560]   So if you look at the journal like nature, so with impact factor of like in the low 40s,
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.440]   there's no way that you're going to be able to sustain that level of impact factor by just
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.080]   grabbing the attention of scientists. What I mean by that is like, for the journals,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:29.280]   the articles that get published in nature, they need to be New York Times great. So they need to
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:35.120]   make it to the big media, they need to be captured by the big media. Because that's the only way for
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.360]   you to capture enough attention to sustain that level of citations. And that of course, creates
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:48.320]   problems because people then will try to, again, gamify the system and have like titles or abstracts
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:57.120]   or that are bigger, make claims that are bigger than what is actually can be sustained by the data
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.720]   or the content of the paper. And you will have clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts. And
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:10.320]   again, this is all a consequence of metrics and science of metrics. And this is a very dangerous
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.240]   cycle that I think it's very hard to break, but it's happening in academia in a lot of fields
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.840]   right now. - Is it fundamentally the existence of metrics or the metrics just need to be significantly
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:30.720]   improved? Because like I said, the metrics used for Amazon for purchasing, I don't know, computer
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   parts is pretty damn good in terms of selecting which are the good ones, which are not. In that
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:44.000]   same way, if we had Amazon type of review system in the space of ideas, in the space of science,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.800]   it feels like those metrics would be a little bit better. Sort of when it's significantly more open
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:59.440]   to the crowdsource nature of the internet, of the scientific internet, meaning as opposed to,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.880]   like my biggest problem with peer review has always been that it's like five, six, seven people,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:13.360]   usually even less. And it's often nobody's incentivized to do a good job in the whole
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:22.480]   process. Meaning it's anonymous in a way that doesn't incentivize, like doesn't gamify or
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:30.080]   incentivize great work. And also it doesn't necessarily have to be anonymous. Like there
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:39.680]   has to be, the entire system doesn't encourage actual sort of rigorous review. For example, like
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:47.280]   open review does kind of incentivize that kind of process of collaborative review,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.960]   but it's also imperfect. It just feels like the thing that Amazon has, which is like thousands
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:47:00.640]   of people contributing their reviews to a product. It feels like that could be applied to science
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:08.000]   where the same kind of thing you're doing with Fermat's library, but doing at a scale that's much
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.120]   larger. It feels like that should be possible given the number of grad students, given the number of
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:22.560]   general public that's, like for example, I personally, as a person who got an education
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:32.480]   in mathematics and computer science, like I can be a quote unquote like reviewer on a lot bigger
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:41.600]   set of things than is my exact expertise. If I'm one of thousands of reviewers, if I'm the only
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.680]   reviewer, one of five, then I better be like an expert in the thing. But if I, and I've learned
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:54.320]   this with COVID, which is like, you can just use your basic skills as a data analyst as a,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.200]   and to contribute to the review process on a particular little aspect of a paper and be able
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:05.680]   to comment, be able to sort of draw in some references that challenge the ideas presented
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:12.240]   or to enrich the ideas that are presented, or, you know, it just feels like crowdsourcing
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:20.480]   the review process would be able to allow you to have metrics in terms of how good a paper is
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.080]   that are much better representative of its actual impact in the world, of its actual value to the
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:35.440]   world, as opposed to some kind of arbitrary gamified version of its impact. - I agree with
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.520]   that. I think we, there's definitely the possibility, at least for more resilient,
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.280]   a more resilient system than what we have today. And it's, I think that's kind of what you're
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:50.160]   describing, Alex. And I mean, to an extent we kind of have like a little bit of a Heisenberg
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.480]   uncertainty principle. When you pick a metric, as soon as you do it, then maybe it works as a good
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.480]   heuristic for a short amount of time, but soon enough people would start gamifying and, but then
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.200]   you can definitely have metrics that are more resilient to gamification and they'll work as
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:12.000]   a better heuristic to try to push you in the best direction. - But I guess the underlying problem
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.080]   you're saying is there's a shortage of positions in academia. - That's a big problem for me. - Yeah.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.800]   And that, and so they're going to be constantly gamifying the metrics. - It's a bit of a zero
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.080]   sum game. - It's a very competitive, it's a very competitive field. And that's what usually happens
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:34.880]   in very competitive fields. - Yeah. - But I think some of like the peer review problems, like scale
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   helps, I think. And it's interesting to look at like what you're mentioning, breaking it down,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:47.040]   maybe in like smaller parts and having more people jumping in. But this is definitely a problem.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.240]   And the peer review problem, as I mentioned, is correlated with the problem of like academic
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.920]   career progression and it's all intertwined. And that's why I think it's so hard to break it.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:02.800]   There are like a couple of really interesting things that are being done right now. There are a
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.440]   couple of, for instance, journals that are overlay journals on top of platforms like archive and
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.480]   bio-archive that want to remove like the more traditional journals from the equation.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:21.360]   So essentially a journal is just a collection of links to papers. And what they are trying to do
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:27.200]   is like removing that middleman and trying to make the review process a little bit more transparent
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:36.000]   and not charging universities. Like there are a couple of more famous ones. There's one discreet
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.280]   analysis in mathematics. There's one called the Quantum Journal, which we're actually working with
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.840]   them. We have a partnership with them for the papers that get published in Quantum Journal.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.480]   They also get the annotations on formats and they're doing pretty well. They've been able to
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.200]   grow substantially. The problem there is getting to critical mass. So it's again, convincing the
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:01.120]   researchers and especially the young researchers that need that impact factor, need those
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:07.520]   publications to have citations to not publish on the traditional journal and go on an open journal
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.960]   and publish their work there. I think there are a couple of really high profile scientists,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.240]   people like Tim Gowers, that are trying to incentivize like famous scientists that already
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:24.000]   have tenure and that don't need that to publish that to increase the reputation of those journals
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.440]   so that other maybe younger scientists can start publishing on those as well. And so they can try
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:36.720]   to break that vicious cycle of the more traditional journals. - I mean, another possible way to break
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:45.520]   this cycle is to like raise public awareness and just by force, like ban paid journals. Like what
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:54.560]   exactly are they contributing to the world? Like basically making it illegal to forget the fact
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.800]   that it's mostly federally funded. So that's a super ugly picture too. But like, why should
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:08.880]   knowledge be so expensive? Like where everyone is working for the public good and then there's
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:16.000]   these gatekeepers that, you know, most people can't read most papers without having to pay money.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.680]   And that doesn't make any sense. Like that should be illegal. - I mean, that's what you're saying
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.880]   is exactly right. I mean, for instance, right, I went to school here in the US, we studied in Europe
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.600]   and you would sit, like you'd ask me all the time to download papers and send it to him because he
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.240]   just couldn't get it and like papers that he needed for his research. And so- - But he's a student,
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.560]   like he's- - Yeah, he's a grad student. - He was a grad student, but that, you know, I'm even
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:50.880]   referring to just regular people. - Oh yeah, okay, that too. - And I think during 2020, because of
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:56.320]   COVID, a lot of journals put down the walls for certain kind of coronavirus related papers.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:04.080]   But like that just gave me an indication that like, this should be done for everything. It's absurd.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:11.280]   Like people should be outraged that there's these gates because, so the moment you dissolve the
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:18.720]   journals, then there'll be an opportunity for startups to build stuff on top of archive. It'd
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:25.360]   be an opportunity for like Fermat's library to step up, to scale up to something much even larger.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.040]   I mean, that was the original dream of Google, which I've always admired, which is make the
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.000]   world's information accessible. Actually, it's interesting that Google hasn't, maybe you guys
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.920]   can correct me, but they have put together Google Scholar, which is incredible. And they've
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:50.000]   did the scanning of books, but they haven't really tried to make science accessible in the following
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.200]   way. Like besides doing Google Scholar, they haven't like delved into the papers, right?
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.600]   - Which is especially curious given what Luis was saying, right? That it's kind of in their
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:06.960]   genesis, there's this research that was very connected with how papers reference each other
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:11.520]   and like building a network out of that. - Interesting enough, like Google, I think
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.800]   there was not intended, Google Plus was like the Google social network that caught cancel,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   was used by a lot of researchers. - Yes, it was.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:24.000]   - With what I think was just a side, kind of a side effect, but then a lot of people ended up
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.840]   migrating to Twitter, but it was not on purpose. But yeah, I agree with you, like they haven't
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.440]   gone past Google Scholar and I don't know why. - Well, that said, Google Scholar is incredible.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:40.000]   For people who are not familiar, it's one of the best aggregation of all the scientific work that's
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.680]   out there and especially the network that connects all of them, what sites, what, and also trying to
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.480]   aggregate all of the versions of the papers that are available there and trying to merge them in a
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:55.200]   way that one particular work, even though it's available in a bunch of places, counts as,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:01.280]   you know, like a central hub of what that work is across the multiple versions. But that almost
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:08.000]   seems like a fun pet project of a couple of engineers within Google, as opposed to a serious
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.920]   effort to make the world science accessible. - But going back to just the journals, when
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:20.720]   you're talking about that, Lex, I believe that in that front, I think we might be past the event
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:27.840]   horizon. So I think the business model for the journals doesn't make sense. They're a middle
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:33.040]   layer that is not adding a lot of value and you see a lot of motions, whereas like in Europe,
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:39.600]   a lot of the papers that are funded by the European Union, they will have to be
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.880]   open to the public. And I think there's a lot of... - Bill Gates too, like what the Gates Foundation
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:54.560]   funds, like the demand that it's accessible to everybody. - So I think it's a question of time
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.880]   before that wall kind of falls. And that is going to open a lot of possibilities. Because, you know,
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:07.040]   imagine if you had like the layer of, that gigantic layer of papers all available online,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.680]   that unlocks a lot of potential as a platform for people to build things on top of that.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:20.400]   - But I think to what you're saying, it is weird. Like you can literally go and listen to any song
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.840]   that was ever made on your phone, right? You open Spotify and you might not even pay for it. You
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.760]   might be on the free version and you can listen to any song that was ever made pretty much.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:38.080]   But there's like, you don't have access to a huge percentage of academic papers, which is just like
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.280]   this fundamental knowledge that we're all funding, but you as an individual don't have access to it.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:49.440]   And somehow, you know, like the problem for music got solved, but for papers, it's still like...
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.840]   - It's just not yet. It could be ad supported, all those kinds of things. And then hopefully
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.600]   that would change the way we do science. That's the most exciting thing for me,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:04.720]   is especially once I started like making videos and this silly podcast thing, I started to realize
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:12.160]   that if you want to do science, one of the most effective ways is to do a couple,
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.040]   the paper with a set of YouTube videos, like explaining it.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:23.920]   - Yeah. That also seems like there's a lot of room for disruption there. What is the paper 2.0
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:31.680]   going to look like? I think like LaTeX and the PDF seems like, if you look at the first paper
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.080]   that got published in Nature, and if you look at the paper that got published in Nature today,
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:41.280]   look at the two side by side, they are fundamentally the same. And even though like
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.840]   the paper that gets published today, you know, you get even code, like right now people put like
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:56.240]   code on a PDF. And there are so many things that are related to papers today. You have data,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:03.840]   you have code, you might need videos to better explain the concepts. So I think for me, it's
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.000]   natural that there's going to be also an evolution there, that papers are not going to be just the
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   static PDFs or LaTeX. There's going to be a next interface. - So in academia, a lot of things that
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.360]   you're judged by is often quantity, not quality. I wonder if there's a opportunity to have like,
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.520]   I tend to judge people by the best work they've ever done as opposed to...
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:34.000]   I wonder if there's a possibility for that to encourage sort of focusing on the quality
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.200]   and not necessarily in paper form, but maybe a subset of a paper, subset of idea,
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:44.000]   almost even a blog post or an experiment. Like why does it have to be published in a journal
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:51.040]   to be legitimate? - And it's interesting that you mentioned that. I also think like, yeah,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:59:00.080]   why is that the only format? Why can't a blog post or... We were even experimenting with these
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:08.160]   a few months ago. Can you actually like publish something or like a new scientific breakthrough
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:13.280]   or something that you've discovered in the form of like a set of tweets,
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:21.200]   a Twitter thread? Why can't that be possible? And we were experimenting with that idea.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:27.440]   We even, yeah, we ran a couple of, like some people submitted a couple of those,
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.880]   like I think the limit was three or four tweets. Maybe it's a new way to look at a proof or
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:38.160]   something, but I think it just serves to show that there should be other ways to publish like
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   scientific discoveries that don't fit the paper format. - Well, but so even with the Twitter thread,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.400]   it would be nice to have some mechanism of formalizing it and making it
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:58.960]   into an NFT. - Maybe. - Like a concrete thing that you can reference with a link that's unique.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:09.120]   Because I mean, everything we've been saying, all of that, while being true, it's also true that
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:17.920]   the constraints and the formalism of a paper works well. It like forces you, constraints forces you
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:27.200]   to narrow down your thing and literally put it on paper, but you know. - I agree. - Make concrete.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:34.160]   And that's why, I mean, it's not broken. It's just could be better. And that's the main idea.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:41.040]   I think there's something about writing, whether it's a blog post or Twitter thread or a paper,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:49.520]   that's really nice to concretize a particular little idea that can then be referenced by
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:58.400]   other ideas, then it can be built on top of with other ideas. So let me ask, you've read quite a
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:06.080]   few papers, you've annotated quite a few papers. Let's talk about the process itself. How do you
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:12.640]   advise people read papers? Or maybe you want to broaden it beyond just papers, but just read
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.200]   concrete pieces of information to understand the insights that lay within. - I would say for papers
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.160]   specifically, I would bring back kind of what Luis was talking about, is that it's important to keep
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:31.920]   in mind that papers are not optimized for ease of understanding. And so, right, there's all sorts of
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:38.640]   restrictions in size and format and language that they can use. And so it's important to keep that
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.280]   in mind. And so that if you're struggling to read a paper, that might not mean that the underlying
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.760]   material is actually that hard. And so that's definitely something that, especially for us,
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.960]   that we read papers and most of the times we'll read papers that are completely outside of our
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:05.040]   comfort zone, I guess. And so it'd be completely new areas to us. So I always try to keep that in
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.200]   mind. - So there's usually a certain kind of structure, like abstract introduction, there's
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:17.440]   methodology, depending on the community and so on. Is there something about the process of like
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.080]   how to read it, whether you want to skim it to try to find the parts that are easy to understand
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:28.720]   and not, reading it multiple times? Is there any kind of hacks that you can comment on?
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:35.520]   - I remember like Feynman had this kind of hack when he was reading papers where he would basically,
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:45.360]   I think I believe he would read the conclusion of the paper and we would try to just see if he would
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.000]   be able to figure out how to get to the conclusion in like a couple of minutes by himself.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:58.640]   And he would read a lot of papers that way. And I think Fermi also did that almost. And Fermi was
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.520]   known for doing a lot of back of the envelope calculations. So he was a master at doing that.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.640]   In terms of like, especially when reading a paper, I think a lot of times people might
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:18.480]   feel discouraged about the first time you read it, it's very hard to grasp or you don't understand a
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:24.000]   huge fraction of the paper. And I think it's having read a lot of papers in my life, I think
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.360]   I'm in peace with like the fact that you might spend hours where you're just reading a paper
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:36.960]   and jumping from paper to paper, reading citations. And like your level of understanding of sometimes
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:44.400]   of the paper is very close to 0%. And all of a sudden, everything kind of makes sense in your
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:51.360]   mind. And then you have this quantum jump where all of a sudden you understand the big picture
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:58.240]   of the paper. And this is an exercise that I have to do when reading papers, and especially like
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.840]   more complex papers, like, okay, you don't understand because you're just going through
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.280]   the process and just keep going. And it might feel super chaotic, especially if you're jumping
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.800]   from reference to reference. You might end up with like 20 tabs open and you're reading a ton of
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.200]   other papers, but it's just trusting that process, that at the end, like you'll find light. And I
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.840]   think for me, that's a good framework when reading a paper. It's hard because you might end up
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:34.000]   spending a lot of time and it looks like you're lost, but that's the process to actually understand
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.840]   what they're talking about in the paper. - Yeah, I think that process, I've found a lot of value
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.560]   in the process, especially for things outside my field, reading a lot of related work sections
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   and kind of going down that path of getting a big context of the field, because what's,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.080]   especially when they're well-written, there's opinions injected into the related work. Like
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:03.600]   what work is important, what is not. And if you read multiple related work sections that cite or
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:09.520]   don't cite each other, like the papers, you get a sense of where the field, where the tensions of
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:16.400]   the field are, where the field is striving. And that helps you put into context, like whether the
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.480]   work is radical, whether it's overselling itself, whether it's underselling itself, all those
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:31.520]   things. And added on top of that, I find that often the related work section is the most kind
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.240]   of accessible and readable part of a paper, because it's kind of, it's brief to the point,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:43.280]   it's trying to like summarizing, it's almost like a Wikipedia style article. The introduction is
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.800]   supposed to be a compelling story or whatever, but it's often like overselling, there's like an
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   agenda introduction. The related work usually has the least amount of agenda, except for the few
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.680]   like elements where you're trying to talk shit about previous work, where you're trying to sell
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.720]   that you're doing much better. But other than that, when you're just painting where the field
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.120]   came from or where the field stands, that's really valuable. And also, again, just to agree
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.640]   with Fiona in the conclusion, but it's like, I get a lot of value from the breadth first search,
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:23.040]   kind of read the conclusion, then read the related work, and then go through the references in the
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:29.280]   related work, read the conclusion, read the related work, and just go down the tree until
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   you like hit dead ends or run out of coffee. And then through that process, you go back up the tree
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.960]   and now you can see the results in their proper context. Unless of course the paper is truly
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.920]   revolutionary, which even that process will help you understand that is in fact truly revolutionary.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:55.920]   You've also, you talked about just following your Twitter thread in a depth first search.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:03.360]   You talked about that you read the book on Grisha Perlman, Grigori Perlman, and then you had a
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:09.840]   really nice Twitter thread on it and you were taking notes throughout. So at a high level,
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.880]   is there suggestions you can give on how to take good notes? Whether it's, we're talking about
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.000]   annotations or just for yourself to try to put on paper ideas as you progress through the work in
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.320]   order to then like understand the work better? For me, I always try not to underestimate how
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.040]   much you can forget within six months after you've read something. I thought you were going to say
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.400]   five minutes, but yeah, six months is good. Yeah, or even shorter. And so that's something
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:45.200]   that I always try to keep in mind. And it's often, I mean, every once in a while I'll read back a
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:52.960]   paper that I annotated on Fermat and I'll read through my own annotations and I've completely
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:00.800]   forgotten what I had written. But it also, it's interesting because in a way, after you just
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:06.720]   understood something, you're kind of the best possible teacher that can teach your future self.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:14.640]   After you've forgotten it, you're kind of your own best possible teacher at that moment.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.840]   And so it can be great to try to capture that. It's brilliant. It just made me kind of
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:30.240]   realize it's really nice to put yourself in the position of teaching an older version of yourself
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:36.000]   that returns to this paper, almost like thinking it literally. That's under explored, but it's super
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.760]   powerful because you were the person that you can, if you look at the scale from one, not knowing
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.720]   anything about the topic, and 10, you are the one that progressed from one to 10 and you know which
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.240]   steps you struggled with. So you're really the best person to help yourself make that transition
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:09:01.600]   from one to 10. And a lot of the times, I really believe that the framework that we have to expose
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.880]   ourselves to be talking to us when we were an expert, when we were taking that class and we
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.360]   knew everything about quantum mechanics. And then six months later, you don't remember half of the
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:19.680]   things. How could we make it easier to have those conversations between you and your past expert
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:27.120]   self? I think there might be, it's an under explored idea. I think notes on paper are probably
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.960]   not the best way. I'm not sure if it's a combination of video, audio, where it's like you
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:38.480]   have a guided framework that you follow to extract information from yourself so that you can later
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:47.040]   kind of revisit to make it easier to remember. But that's, I think it's an interesting idea worth
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:53.200]   exploring that I haven't seen a lot of people kind of trying to distill that problem.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:00.400]   Yeah, creating the kind of tools. I find if I record, it sounds weird, but I'll take notes. But
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:10.160]   if I record audio, like little clips of thoughts, like rants, that's really effective at capturing
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:17.120]   something that notes can't. Because when I replay them, for some reason, it loads my brain back
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.520]   into where I was when I was reading that in a way that notes don't. Like when I read notes,
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.760]   I'll often be like, "Whoa, what? What was I thinking there?" But when I listened to the audio,
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:36.160]   it brings you right back to that place. And maybe with video, with visual, that might be even more
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:44.080]   powerful. I think so. Yeah. And I think just the process of verbalizing it, that alone kind of
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.680]   makes you have to structure your thought and put it in a way that somebody else could come and
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:57.120]   understand it. And just the process of that is useful to organize your thoughts. And yeah,
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.480]   just that alone. Does the Fermat's Library Journal Club have a video component or no?
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.840]   Not natively. Sometimes we'll include videos, but it's always embedded.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.720]   Do people build videos on top of it to explain the paper? Because you're doing all the hard work
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:20.880]   of understanding deeply the paper. We haven't seen that happening too much, but we were actually
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.160]   playing around with the idea of creating some sort of podcast version where we try to distill
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.720]   the paper on an audio format that not maybe you can have access to. Might be trickier, but there
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.640]   are definitely people that could be interested in the paper and that topic, but are not willing
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.480]   to read it. But they might listen to a 30-minute episode on that paper. You could reach more people
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.200]   and you might even bring the authors to the conversation, but it's tricky, especially for
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.080]   more technical papers. We've thought about doing that, but we haven't converged. I'm sure if you
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.560]   have any... Well, I'm going to take that as a small project to take one of the Fermat's, almost
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:05.760]   half advertisement and half as a challenge for myself, to take one of the annotated papers and
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:14.720]   use it as a basis for creating a quick video. I've seen, hopefully I'm saying the name correctly, but
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.840]   Machine Learning Street Talk. I think that's the name of the show that I recommend highly.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.760]   That's the right name. But they do exactly that, which is multiple hour breakdown of a paper with
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.120]   video component. Sometimes with authors, people love it. It's very effective.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:40.000]   There's also, I've seen, I haven't seen the entire, in its entirety, but I've seen the founder of
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.960]   comma.ai, George. I've seen him just taking a paper and then distilling the paper and coding it,
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:55.600]   coding it sometimes doing 10 hours. And he was able to get a lot of people interested in that
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.480]   and viewing him. - So I'm a huge fan of that.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:05.520]   George is a personality. I think a lot of people listen to this podcast for the same reason.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:13.760]   It's not necessarily the contents. They like to listen to a silly Russian who has a childlike brain
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:20.240]   and mumbles and all those like struggle with ideas. And George is a madman. People just enjoy,
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.560]   how is he going to struggle in implementing this particular paper? How is he going to
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.800]   struggle with this idea? It's fun to watch and that actually pulls you in. The personality
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.160]   is important there. - True. I agree with you,
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:39.200]   but there also, it's visible. There's an extraordinary ability that is there. He's
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:44.960]   talented and you need to have, there's a craft and this guy definitely has talent and he's doing
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.640]   something that is not easy. And I think that also draws the attention of people. And the other day,
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:55.840]   we were actually, we ran into this YouTube channel of this guy that was restoring art.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:05.760]   And it was basically just a video of him. The production is really well done. And it's just
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:12.480]   him taking really old pieces of art and then paintings and then restoring them. But he's
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.080]   really good at that. And he describes that process and that draws the attention of people,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.960]   regardless of your craft, be it like annotating a paper, restoring it.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.200]   - Craftsmanship, excellence. Yeah. George is incredibly good at programming.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.760]   You know, those competitive programmers, like Top Coater and all those kinds of stuff. He has
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:39.040]   the same kind of element where the brain just jumps around really quickly. And that's, yeah,
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.280]   just like with art restoration. - And it's also motivating.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:48.080]   - Yeah, it's motivating. But you're right, in watching people who are good at what they do,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.600]   it's motivating, even if the thing you're trying to do is not what they're doing.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:56.160]   It's just like contagious when they're really good at it. And the same kind of analysis with
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.400]   the paper, I think, so not just like the final result, but the process of struggling with it.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.840]   That's really interesting. - Yeah. I think Twitch proved that
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.760]   like, you know, that there's really a market for that, for watching people do things that they're
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:18.800]   really good at and you'll just watch it. You will enjoy that, that might even spike your interest
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:26.080]   in that specific topic. And yeah, people will enjoy watching sometimes hours on end of great
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.200]   craftsmen. - Do you mind if we talk about some of the
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.680]   papers, do any papers come to mind that have been annotated on Fermat's library?
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.960]   - The papers that we annotated can be about completely random topics, but that's part of
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.360]   what we enjoy as well. It forces you to explore these topics that otherwise maybe you'd never
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:51.680]   run into. And so the ones that come to mind are, to me, are fairly random, but one that I really
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:16:00.080]   enjoyed learning more about is a paper written by a mathematician, actually, Tom Apostol,
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:10.240]   and about a tunnel in a Greek island off the coast of Turkey. So it's very random.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:18.000]   So this, okay, so what's interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel was built in the 6th
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:27.360]   century BC and it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said, off the coast of Turkey.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.160]   And they had the city on one side and the other mountain, and then they had a bunch of springs
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:40.320]   on the other side and they wanted to bring water into the city. Building an aqueduct would be
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.440]   pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped. And it would also, if they were under a
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.520]   siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct and then the water wouldn't have any
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.480]   water supply, the city wouldn't have any water supply. And so they decided to build a tunnel
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:07.280]   and they decided to try to do it quickly. And so they started digging from both ends at the same
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.400]   time through the mountain. And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:22.640]   problem. And this is like 6th century BC. So you had very limited access to the mathematical tools
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:27.680]   that you had at the time were very limited. And so what this paper is about is about the story
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:35.760]   of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years, the accepted explanation of how
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.240]   they built it was actually wrong. And so this tunnel has been famous for a while. There are
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.800]   a number of historians that talked about it since ancient Egypt. And the method that they described
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:57.040]   for building it was just wrong. And so these researchers went there and were able to figure
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:02.720]   that out. And so basically, kind of the way that they thought they had built it was basically,
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:07.920]   if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top and you have the mountain, then you have
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.640]   both entrances. And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians described,
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:24.480]   is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:29.440]   of the hypotenuse. And the way they did is like they would go around the mountain and kind of
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:36.560]   walking in a grid fashion. And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle. And then after
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:43.680]   you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each entrance that are
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.360]   proportional to that big triangle. And then you kind of have arrows pointing in each way.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:56.400]   And then you know at least that you have a line going through the mountain that connects
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:03.680]   both entrances. The issue with that is like, once you go to this mountain and you start thinking of
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.480]   doing this, you realize that, especially given that the tools that they had at the time, that
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:17.440]   your error margin would be too small. You wouldn't be able to do it. Just the fact of trying to build
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.080]   this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you would end up missing. You'd
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.000]   start building these tunnels and they would miss each other. - So the task ultimately is to figure
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.280]   out like really perfectly, as close as possible, the direction you should be digging. First of all,
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.040]   that it's possible to have a straight line through and then what that direction would be.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:44.320]   And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle. I'm not exactly
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:50.560]   sure about how to do that rigorously, like by tracing the mountain, by walking along the mountain.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:56.720]   You said grids? - Yeah, you kind of walk as if you were in a grid and so you just walk in right
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.880]   angles. - But then you have to walk really precisely then. You have to use tools to measure
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:09.760]   this and the terrain is probably a mess. So this makes more sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:16.640]   So, okay, gotcha. - But so this method was described by an ancient Egyptian historian,
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:24.160]   I think, Hero of Alexandria. And then for about 2000 years, that's how we thought that they'd
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:32.720]   built this tunnel. And then these researchers went there and found out that actually they must have
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:39.680]   to use other methods. And then in this paper, they describe these other methods. And of course,
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.000]   they can't know for sure, but they presented a bunch of plausible alternatives. The one that
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.120]   for me is the most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:59.280]   is similar to an iron sight on a rifle, the way you can line up your rifle with a target off in
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   the distance by having an iron sight. And they must have done something similar to that effectively
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:17.600]   with three sticks. And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.400]   that were all on the same height. And so that then you could get to the other side,
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:29.200]   and then you could draw that line. So this for me is the most plausible way that they might have
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:36.240]   done that. But then they described this in detail and other possible approaches in this paper.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.040]   - So this is a mathematician doing this? - Yeah, this is a mathematician that did this.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:47.520]   - Which I suppose is the right mindset instead of skills required to solve an ancient problem.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.040]   - Yeah. - Mathematicians and engineers,
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.960]   there are a lot of things. - Because they didn't have computers or
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.680]   drones or LIDAR back then or whatever technology you would use modern day for civil engineering.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:07.120]   - Yeah. And another fascinating thing is that effectively after the downfall of the Roman
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:12.160]   civilization, people didn't build tunnels for about a thousand years. We go a thousand years
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.120]   without tunnels. And then only in late middle ages that we start doing them again.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:23.920]   But here is a tunnel like sixth century BC, like incredibly limited mathematics. And they build it
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:30.880]   in this way. And it was a mystery for a long time exactly how they did it. And then these
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:37.440]   mathematicians went there and basically with no archeology kind of background, were able to figure
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:43.920]   it out. - How do annotations for this paper look like? What's a successful annotation for paper
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.360]   like this? - Yeah. So sometimes you're for this paper,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:56.880]   sometimes adding some more context on a specific part. Like sometimes they mentioned, for instance,
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:04.640]   these instruments that were common in ancient Greece and ancient Rome for building things.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.800]   And so in some of those annotations, I described these instruments in more detail and how they
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:20.560]   worked. 'Cause sometimes it can be hard to visualize these. Then this paper, I forget exactly
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:27.840]   when this was published. I believe maybe the seventies. But then there was further research
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:33.520]   into this tunnel and other interesting aspects about it. I add those to that paper as well.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.640]   There's historical context that I also go into there. For instance, the fact that as I said,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.960]   that effectively after the downfall of the Roman empire, no tunnels were built. Like this is
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:50.960]   something that I added to the paper as well. Yeah. So those are- - So when other people look at the
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:56.320]   paper, how did they usually consume the annotations? So it's like, is there a commenting feature?
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.240]   I mean, like this is a really enriching experience the way you read a paper.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.760]   What aspects do people usually talk about that they value from this?
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:15.680]   Yeah. So anybody can just go on there and either add a new annotation or other comments to an
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.280]   existing annotation. And so you can start a kind of a thread within an existing annotation.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.800]   And that's something that happens relative frequency. And then because I was the original
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:34.080]   author of the initial annotation, I get pinged. And so oftentimes I'll go back and add on to that
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.360]   thread. - How'd you pick the paper? I mean, first of all, this whole process is really exciting.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.320]   I'm gonna, especially after this conversation, I'm gonna make sure I participate much more
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.280]   actively on papers that I know a lot about and on paper I know nothing about. I should- - You get
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:56.880]   to annotate the paper. - I would love to. I also, I mean, I realized that there's a,
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:06.560]   like, it's an opportunity for people like me to publicly annotate a paper. Like- - Or do an AMA
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.760]   around the paper. - Yeah, exactly. But yeah, but like be in the conversation about a paper. It's
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.680]   like a place to have a conversation about an idea. The other way to do it that's much more ad hoc is
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.880]   on Twitter, right? But this is more like formal and you could actually probably integrate the two.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.360]   They have a conversation about the conversation. So the Twitter is the conversation about a
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.400]   conversation and the main conversation is in the space of annotations. - There's an interesting
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.280]   effect that we see sometimes with the annotations on our papers is that a lot of people, especially
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:46.960]   if the annotations are really well done, people sometimes are afraid of adding more annotations
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.680]   because they see that as a kind of a finished work. And so they don't want to pollute that.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:59.280]   And especially if it's like a silly question. I don't think that's good. I think we should as
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.360]   much as possible try to lower the barrier for someone to jump in and ask questions. I think
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.480]   most of the times it adds value, but it's some feedback that we got from users and readers.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:21.120]   I'm not exactly sure how to kind of fight that, but... - Well, I think if I serve as an inspiration
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:27.840]   in any way is by asking a lot of dumb questions and saying a bunch of dumb shit all the time.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:33.600]   And hopefully that inspires the rest of the other folks to do the same, because that's the only way
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.720]   to knowledge, I think, is to be willing to ask the dumb questions. - And there are papers that are
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:44.800]   like... We have a lot of papers on Fermat's where it's just one page, or really short papers. And
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.720]   we have like the shortest paper ever published in a math journal, with just a couple of words.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:57.600]   One of my favorite papers on the platform is actually a paper written by Enrico Fermi. And
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.640]   the title of the paper is, I think, is "My Observations at Trinity." So basically Fermi
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:10.240]   was part of the Manhattan Project. So he was in New Mexico when they exploded the first atomic bomb.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.840]   And so he was a couple of miles away from the explosion, and he was probably one of the first
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:22.560]   persons to calculate the energy of the explosion. And so the way he did that was he took a piece of
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:27.920]   paper and he tore down a piece of paper in little pieces. And when the bomb exploded,
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.840]   the Trinity bomb was the name of the bomb, he waited for the blast to arrive at where he was.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.520]   And then he threw those pieces of paper in the air, and he calculated the energy based on the
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.040]   displacement of the paper, the pieces of paper. And then he wrote a report, which was classified
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.720]   until a couple of years ago. One page report, calculating the energy of the explosion.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.760]   - Oh, that's so badass. - And we actually went there and
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.600]   kind of unpacked and I think he just mentions basically the energy, and we actually went,
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.080]   and one of the annotations is like explaining how he did that.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:08.240]   - I wonder how accurate he was. - It was maybe, I think, like 20 or 25% off.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.640]   Then there was another person that actually calculated the energy based on images after
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:22.240]   the explosion and the rate at which the mushroom of the explosion expanded. And it's more accurate
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.000]   to calculate the energy based on that. And I think it was like 20, 20% off. But it's really
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.280]   interesting because Fermi was known for all these, being a master at these back of the envelope
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:39.600]   calculations, all those, like the Fermi problems are well known for that. And it's super interesting
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.360]   to see that just one page report, it was also actually classified. And it's interesting because
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:52.000]   a couple of months ago, when the Beirut explosion happened, there was a video circulating of these
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.200]   a bride that was doing a photo shoot when the explosion in Beirut happened. And so you can see
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.440]   a video of her with the wedding dress, and then the explosion happens and the blast arrives at
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.840]   where she was. She was a couple of miles away from the blast. And you can see like the displacement
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.320]   of the dress as well. And I actually looked, and that video went viral on Twitter. And I actually
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.240]   looked at that video and used the same techniques that Fermi used to calculate the energy of the
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.240]   explosion based on the displacement of the dress. And you could actually see where she was at the
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.080]   distance from the explosion, because there was a store behind her and you could look the name of
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.000]   the store. And so I calculated that. - The distance and then you can...
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.680]   - Based on the distance where she was from the explosion and also on the displacement of the
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.160]   dress, like because you can, when the blast happens, like you can see the dress going back
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:49.200]   and then going back to the original position. And like, by just looking at how much the dress moved,
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.760]   you can estimate the energy of the explosion. - I assume you published this.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.920]   - On Twitter, it was just a Twitter thread. But actually like a lot of people share that and it
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:05.920]   was picked up by a couple of news outlets. - I was hoping it would be like a formal title
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.760]   and it would be an archive. - No, no, no, no.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.560]   - It may be submitted. - Just the Twitter thread. But it was
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.560]   interesting because it was exactly the same method that Fermi used.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.480]   - Is there something else that jumps to mind? Like, is there something, I know like in terms
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:25.600]   of papers, like I know the Bitcoin paper is super popular. Is there something interesting to be said
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:32.720]   about any of the white papers in the cryptocurrency space? - Yeah, the Bitcoin paper was the first paper
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:38.400]   that we put on for months. - Why that choice as the first paper?
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:46.000]   - This was a while ago and it was one of the papers that I read and then kind of explained it
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:52.400]   to Luiz and there were two other friends that do this journal club with us. And I did some research
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:59.040]   in cryptography as an undergrad. And so it was a topic that I was interested in. But even for me,
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:06.400]   that I had that background, but reading the Bitcoin paper, it took me a few reads to really
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:13.120]   kind of wrap my head around it. It uses very spartan, precise language in a way. It's like,
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:19.200]   you feel like you can't take any word out of it without something falling apart. And it's all
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:27.920]   there. I think it's a beautiful paper and it's very well-written, of course, but we wanted to
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.960]   try to make it accessible so that anybody that maybe is an undergrad in computer science could
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:40.000]   go on there and know that you have all the information in that page that you're going to
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:48.720]   need to understand the mechanics of Bitcoin. And so I explain the basic public key cryptography
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.760]   that you need to know in order to understand it. I explain, okay, what are the properties of a hash
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:32:00.880]   function and how they are useful in this context. Explain what a Merkle tree is. So a bunch of those
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.320]   basic concepts that maybe if you're reading it for the first time and you're an undergrad and
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:08.720]   you don't know those terms, you're going to be discouraged because maybe, okay, now I have to
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:15.120]   go and Google around until I understand these before I can make progress in the paper. And this
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.920]   way it's all there. So there's a magic to... Also to the fact that over time, more people went on
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:28.480]   there and added further annotations. So the idea that the paper gets easier and more accessible
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:35.440]   over time, but you're still looking at the original content the way the author intended it to be.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:41.920]   But there's just more context and the toughest bits have more in-depth explanations.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:50.400]   - Okay, I think there's just so many interesting papers there. I remember reading the paper that
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:57.280]   was written by Freeman Dyson on the first time that he explained, he came up with the concept
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:04.560]   of the Dyson sphere and he put that out. Again, it's a one-page paper. And what he explained was
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:12.480]   that eventually if a civilization develops and grows, there's going to be a point where when
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.560]   the resources on the planet are not enough for the energy requirements of that civilization.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.000]   So if you want to go, the next step is you need to go to the next star and extract energy from
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   that star. And the way to do it is you need to build some sort of cap around the star that
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:37.520]   extracts the energy. So he theorized this idea of the Dyson sphere and he went on to kind of analyze
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:42.320]   how he would build that, the stability of that sphere. Like if something happens, if there's
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:48.640]   like a small oscillation with that fear collapse into the star or no, what would happen? And even
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.600]   went on to kind of say that a good way for us to look for signs of intelligent life out there
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.920]   is to look for signals of these Dyson spheres. And because according to the law of second law
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.480]   of thermodynamics, like there's going to be a lot of infrared radiation that is going to be emitted
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.480]   as a consequence of extracting energy from the star. And we should be able to see those signals
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:18.000]   of like infrared if we look at the sky. But all these, like from the introduction of the concept,
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.440]   like how to build the Dyson sphere, the problems of like having a Dyson sphere, how to detect how
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.880]   that could be used as a signal for intelligence. - Wait, really? That's all in the paper?
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.040]   - Yeah, all in one, like one page paper. And it's like, for me, it's beautiful. It's like-
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.280]   - Where was this published? - I don't remember.
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:40.320]   - It's fascinating that papers like that could be, I mean, the guts it takes to put that all
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:46.320]   together in a paper form. You know, that kind of challenges our previous discussion of paper. I
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.440]   mean, papers can be beautiful. You can play with the format, right?
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:56.720]   - But there's a lot to unpack there. That's like the starting point, but it's beautiful that you're
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.360]   able to put that in one page and then people can build on top of that.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.760]   - But the key ideas are there. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.680]   - What about, have you looked at any of the big seminal papers throughout the history of science?
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.600]   Like you look at simple, like Einstein papers. Have any of those been annotated?
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.080]   - Yeah, yeah, no. We have some more seminal papers that people will have heard about. You know,
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:32.560]   we have the DNA double helix paper on there. We have the Higgs boson paper. Yeah, there's
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:39.920]   papers that we know that it's, they're not gonna be finding out about them because of us, but it's
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.000]   papers that we think should be more widely read and that folks would benefit from having some
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.720]   annotations there. And so we also have a number of those.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.240]   - Yeah, a lot of like discovery papers for fundamental particles and all that. We have
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:00.000]   a lot of those on Fermat's library. I would like to, we haven't annotated that one, but I'd like
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.400]   to on the Riemann hypotheses. That's a really interesting paper as well. But we haven't
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.400]   annotated that one, but there's a lot of like more historical landmark papers on the platform.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.960]   - Have you done PoincarÃ© conjecture with Perlman?
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.760]   - That's too much.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.480]   - Too much?
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:25.040]   - That's too much for me, but it's interesting that, you know, and going back to our discussion,
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.840]   like the PoincarÃ© paper was like published on archive and it was not on a journal,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.800]   like the three papers.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.400]   - Yeah, what do you make of that? I mean, he's such a fascinating human being.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:34.720]   - Exactly.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.800]   - I mentioned to you offline that I'm going to Russia. He's somebody I'm really-
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.080]   - You should try to interview him.
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:48.480]   - Yeah, well, so I definitely will interview him. And I believe I will, I believe I can,
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:57.520]   I just don't know how to, I know where he lives. So here, okay. My hope is, my conjecture is that
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:03.040]   if I just show up to the house and look desperate enough, that, or threatening enough,
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:08.400]   or some combination of both, that like the only way to get rid of me is to just get the thing done.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:08.960]   That's the hope.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.840]   - It's actually interesting that you mentioned that because I, after I, so a couple of weeks
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:20.240]   ago I was searching for like stuff about Perlman online and ended up on this Twitter account of
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:26.800]   this guy that claims to be Perlman's assistant. And he's like, he has been posting a bunch of
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.600]   pictures like next to Perlman. You can see like Perlman in a library and he's like next to him,
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.960]   like taking a selfie or like Perlman walking on the street and like, maybe you could reach out to
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.520]   this assistant then I'll send you this Twitter account.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.360]   - So maybe you're onto something.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.160]   - No, but going back to like Perlman is super interesting because the fact that he published
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:55.120]   the proofs on archive is what was also like a way for him to, because he really didn't like
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:02.080]   the scientific publishing industry and the fact that you had to pay to get access to articles.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.760]   And that was a form of like protest. And that's why he published those papers there. I mean,
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.360]   I think Perlman is just a fascinating like character. And for me, it's this kind of ideal of,
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:20.640]   platonic ideal of what a mathematician should be. It's someone that is, it's just cares about,
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:30.080]   deeply cares about mathematics. It cares about fair attribution of disregards money. And like
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.840]   the fact that he published like on archive is a good example of that.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.200]   - What about the Fields Medal that he turned down the Fields Medal? What's, what's,
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.360]   what do you make of that?
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.160]   - Yeah, I mean, if you look at like the reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal. So after,
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.800]   so Perlman did a postdoc in the US and when he came back to Russia.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.520]   - Do you know how good his English is?
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.120]   - I think it's fairly good.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:53.760]   - I think it's pretty good.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.800]   - I think it's really good.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.520]   - Especially given lectures in American universities.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.560]   - But I haven't been able to...
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.600]   - Listen to anything.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.840]   - Well, certainly not listen, but I haven't been able to get anybody. Cause I know a lot of people
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:09.920]   have been to those lectures. I'm not able to get a sense of like, yeah, but how strong is the
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.120]   accent? What are we talking about here? Is this going to have to be in Russian? Is it going to
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.080]   have to be in English? It's fascinating. But he writes the papers in English.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.920]   - True. But there's so many, like such a fascinating character. And there are a couple
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.920]   of examples like him, like at, I think 28 or 29, he proved like a really famous conjecture called
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.400]   the Salk Conjecture, I believe it was like in a very short four page proof of that. It was a
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:38.240]   really big breakthrough. Then he went to Princeton to give a lecture on that. And after the lecture,
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:44.640]   the chair of the math department at Princeton, a guy called Peter Sarnak, went up to Perlman,
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:51.520]   was trying to recruit him, trying to offer him a position at Princeton. And at some point he asked
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:57.920]   for Perlman's resume. And Perlman responded saying, just gave a lecture on like this
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.880]   really tough problem. Why do you need my resume? Like, I'm not going to send you, like I just
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:10.720]   proved my value. But going back to the Fields Medal, like when Perlman went to back to Russia,
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:20.400]   he arrived at a time where the salary of postdocs were so much off in regards to inflation that they
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.920]   were not making any money. Like people didn't even bother to pick up the checks at the end of the
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:30.560]   month because they were just like ridiculous. But thankfully he had some money that he had
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:37.600]   gained while he was doing his postdocs. So he just concentrated on like the Poincare conjecture
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:44.640]   problem, which he, when he took that, he took it after it was reframed by this mathematician
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:50.720]   called Richard Hamilton, which posed the problem in a way that it turned into this super like math
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:56.160]   Olympiad problem with like perfect boundaries, well-defined, and that was perfect for Perlman
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.520]   to attack. And so he spent like seven years working on that. And then in 2002, he started
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:07.840]   publishing those papers on archive. And people started jumping on that, reading those papers.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.960]   And there was like a lot of excitement around that. A couple of years later, there were two
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:19.680]   researchers, I believe it was, they were from Harvard that took Perlman's work. They sanded
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:26.080]   some of the edges and they republished that saying that, you know, based on Perlman's work,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:32.560]   they were able to figure out the Poincare conjecture. And then there was at the time at
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:40.080]   the international conference of mathematics in 2006, I believe that's when they were going to
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.920]   give out the Fields Medal. There was a lot of debate of like, oh, who's like, who should get
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:54.240]   the credit for solving this big problem. And for Perlman, it felt really sad that people were even
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:01.680]   considering that he was not the person that solved that. And the claims that those like researchers,
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.440]   when they published after Perlman, they were false claims that they were the ones, they just
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:12.080]   sanded a couple of edges, like Perlman did all the really hard work. And so just the fact that
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.680]   they doubted that Perlman had done that, like was enough for him to say, I'm not interested in this
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.960]   prize. And that was one of the reasons why he rejected the Fields Medal. Then he also rejected
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:28.800]   the Clay prize. So the Poincare conjecture was one of the millennium prizes. There was a million
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.080]   dollar prize associated with that problem. And that has to add to do with the fact that for them
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.360]   to attribute that prize, I think it had to be published on a journal. The proof. And again,
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:46.080]   Perlman's principles of like interfered here. And he also just didn't care about the money. He was
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:51.760]   like, Clay, I think was a businessman and he's like, doesn't have to do anything with mathematics.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:55.920]   I don't care about these. Like, that's one of the reasons why he rejected it.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:05.440]   - Yeah, it's hard to convert into words, but at MIT, I'm distinctly aware of the distinction
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.960]   between when I enter a room, there's a certain kind of music to the way people talk when we're
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:20.080]   talking about ideas versus what that music sounds like when we're talking, when it's like bickering
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:30.080]   in the space of like, whether it's politics or funding or egos, it's a different sound to it.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:38.960]   And I'm distinctly aware of the two. And I kind of, sort of, to me personally, happiness was just
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:45.040]   like swimming around the one that like is the political stuff or the money stuff and all that,
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:53.440]   or egos. And I think that's probably what Perlman is as well. Like the moment he senses there's any,
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.440]   as with the Fields Medal, like the moment you start to have any kind of drama around credit
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:04.560]   assignment, all those kinds of things, it's almost not that it's important who gets the credit. It's
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.000]   like the drama in itself gets in the way of the exploration of the ideas or the fundamental thing
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.240]   that makes science so damn beautiful. - And you can really see that this is also
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:21.760]   a product of that Russian school of like doing science. And you can see that people were,
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.760]   during the Cold War, a lot of mathematicians, they were not making any money. They were doing math
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:33.600]   for the sake of math, like for the intellectual pleasure of like solving a difficult problem.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:41.200]   And even if it was a flawed system and there were a lot of problems with that, they were able to
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.560]   actually achieve these. And there were a lot of, and Perlman for me is the perfect product of that.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.920]   He just cared about like working on tough problems. He didn't care about anything else. It was just
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:57.120]   math, pure math. - Yeah, there's a, like for the broader
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:03.680]   audience, I think another example of that is like professional sports versus Olympics. Especially
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:11.840]   in Russia, I've seen that clear distinction where, because the state manages so much of the Olympic
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:17.280]   process in Russia, as people know, with the steroids, yes, yes, yes. But outside of steroids
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:27.440]   thing is like the athlete can focus on the pure artistry of the sport. Like not worry about the
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.400]   money, not just in the way they talk about it, the way they think about it, the way they define
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.040]   excellence versus like in the, perhaps a bit of a capitalist system in the United States with
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:47.040]   American football, with baseball, basketball, so much of the discussion is about money.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:52.400]   Now, of course, at the end of the day, it's about excellence and artistry and all of that.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:58.080]   But when the culture is so richly grounded in discussions of money and
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.400]   sort of this capitalistic like merch and businesses and all those kinds of things,
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.160]   it changes the nature of the activity. And it's in a way that's hard again to describe in words,
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:20.400]   but when it's purely about the activity itself, it's almost like you quiet down all the noise
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.200]   enough to hear the signal, enough to hear the beauty. Like whenever you're talking about the
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.640]   money, that's when the marketing people come and the business people, the non-creators come and
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:35.200]   they fill the room and they create drama and they know how to create the drama and the noise,
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:41.120]   as opposed to the people who are truly excellent at what they do, the person in their arena.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:49.360]   Like when you remove all the money and you just let that thing shine, that's when true excellence
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.200]   can come out. And that was of the few things that worked with the communist system,
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:01.280]   the Soviet Union, to me at least, as somebody who loves sport and loves mathematics and
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:06.320]   science, that worked well, removing the money from the picture.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:16.880]   Not that I'm saying poverty is good for science. There's some level in which not worrying about
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.560]   money is good for science. It's a weird, I'm not exactly sure what to make of that because capitalism
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:32.080]   works really damn well, but it's tricky how to find that balance. - One Fields Medalist that is
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.240]   interesting to look at, and I think you mentioned it earlier, but it's CÃ©dric Villani, which is,
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:44.400]   might be the only Fields Medalist that is also a politician now. But so it's this brilliant French
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:52.560]   mathematician that won the Fields Medal. And after that, he decided that one of the ways that he
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:59.680]   could have the biggest leverage kind of in pushing science in the direction that he thinks
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:07.680]   science should go would be to try to go into politics. And so that's what he did. And he has
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:13.440]   ran, I'm not sure if he has won any election, but- - I think he's running for mayor of Paris.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.880]   - Paris or something like that. But it's this brilliant mathematician that before winning the
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.720]   Fields Medal had only been just a brilliant mathematician. But after that, he decided to
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.320]   go into politics to try to have an impact and try to change some of the things that he would complain
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:37.840]   about before. So there's that component as well. - Yeah, and I've always thought mathematics and
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:46.000]   science should be like, like James Bond would, in my eyes, I think be sexier if he did math.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.480]   Like we should, as a society, put excellence in mathematics at the same level as being able to
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.600]   kill a man with your bare hands. Like those are both useful features, like that's admirable. It's
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:03.440]   like, oh, like that makes you like, that makes the person interesting. Like being extremely well read
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.160]   about history or philosophy, being good in mathematics, being able to kill a man with
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.120]   bare hands. Those are all the same in my book. So I think all are useful for action stars.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.640]   And I think the society will benefit for giving more value to that. Like one of the things that
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:27.360]   bothers me about American culture is the, I don't know the right words to use, but like the nerdiness
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:37.440]   associated with science. Like, I don't think nerd is a good word in American culture because
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:44.640]   it's seen as like weakness. There's like images that come with that. And it's fine, you could be
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:52.960]   all kinds of shapes and colors and personalities, but like, to me, having sophisticated knowledge
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:50:00.560]   in science, being good at math, doesn't mean you're weak. In fact, it could be the very opposite.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:07.600]   And so it's an interesting thing because it was very much differently viewed in the Soviet Union.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:14.080]   So I know for sure as an existence proof that it doesn't have to be that way. But it...
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:22.400]   - I also feel like we lack a lot of role models in terms, if you ask people to mention one
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.400]   mathematician that they know that is alive today, I think a lot of people would struggle
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.960]   to answer that question. - And I also think, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:43.520]   But there is, having more role models is good. Like different kinds of personalities. He has
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:49.680]   kind of fun and it's very, it's like Bill Nye, the science guy, I don't know if you guys know him.
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.240]   - Net spectrum. - That, yeah. But there's not, like
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:58.160]   Feynman is no longer there. Those kinds of personalities.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.160]   - Carl Sagan, man. - Even Carl Sagan, yeah.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:06.800]   Like a seriousness that's like not playful. - Not apologetical.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:14.640]   - Yeah, exactly. Not apologetic about being knowledgeable. And in fact, the kind of energy
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:23.280]   where you feel self-conscious about not having thought about some of these questions.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:30.160]   Just like when I see James Bond, I feel bad about that I don't, have never killed a man. Like I need
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.720]   to make sure I fix that. That's the way I feel. So that same way, I want to feel like that way
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:40.000]   with Carl Sagan talks, I feel like I need to have that same kind of seriousness about science. Like
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:45.680]   if I don't know something, I want to know it well. What about Terence Tao? He's kind of
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:50.160]   a superstar. What are your thoughts about him? - True. He's probably one of the most famous
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:54.560]   mathematicians alive today. And probably one of, I mean, regardless of like, is of course,
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:52:04.000]   he won a Fields Medal, is a really smart and talented mathematician. It's also like a big
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:12.240]   inspiration for us, at least for some of the work that we do with Fermat's library. So Terence Tao
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:18.960]   is known for having a big blog and he's pretty open about like his research. And he also,
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:27.280]   he tries to make his work as public as possible through his blog posts. In fact, there's a really
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:34.480]   interesting problem that got solved a couple of years ago. So Tao was working on a problem,
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:42.000]   on an Erdos problem actually. So Paul Erdos was this mathematician from Hungary, and he was known
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.280]   for like the Erdos, for a lot of things, but one of the things that he was also known was for the
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:52.960]   Erdos problem. So he was always like creating these problems and usually associating prizes
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:58.000]   with those problems. And a lot of those problems are still open. And there will be, some of them
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.800]   will be open for like maybe a couple of hundred years. And I think that's actually an interesting
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.720]   hack for him to collaborate with future mathematicians. His name will keep coming up
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:15.440]   for future generations. But so Tao was working on one of these problems called the Erdos discrepancy
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:23.920]   and he published a blog post about that problem and he reached like a dead end. And then all of
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:29.680]   a sudden there was this guy from Germany that wrote like a comment on his blog post saying,
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:36.240]   "Okay, so this problem is like a Sudoku like flavor and some of the machinery that we're using
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:42.160]   to solve Sudoku could be used here." And that was actually the key to solve the Erdos discrepancy
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:47.680]   problem. So there was a comment on his blog. And I think that for me is an example of like how to do,
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:55.920]   again, going back to collaborative science online and the power that it has. But Tao is also like
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:04.400]   pretty public about like some of the struggles of being a mathematician. And even he wrote about
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.960]   some of the unintended consequences of having extraordinary ability in a field. And he used
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:16.560]   himself as an example. When he was growing up, he was extremely talented in mathematics from a young
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.960]   age. Like Tao was a person, he won a medal in like one of the IMOs at the age I think was a gold
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:28.240]   medal at the age of 10 or something like that. And so he mentioned that when he was growing up,
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:34.960]   like, and especially in college, when he was in a class that he enjoyed, it just came very natural
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:40.160]   for him and he didn't have to work hard to just ace the class. And when he found that the class
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:47.600]   was boring, like it didn't work and he barely passed. I think in college, he almost failed two
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:54.880]   classes. And he was talking about that and how he brought those studying habits or like in existence
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:55:01.200]   of studying habits when he went to Princeton for his PhD. And in Princeton, when he started kind of
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:08.320]   delving into more complex problems in classes, he struggled a lot because he didn't have that,
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.720]   those habits, like he wasn't taking notes and he wasn't studying hard when he faced problems.
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:22.960]   And he almost failed out of his PhD, he almost failed his PhD exam. And it talks about like
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.040]   having this conversation with his advisor and the advisor pointing out like, you're not,
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.640]   this is not working, you might have to get out of the program. And like how that was a kind of a
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:39.440]   turning point for him. And like it was super important in his career. So I think Tao is also
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:44.320]   like this figure that apart from being just an exceptional mathematician, he's also pretty open
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:50.000]   about what it takes to be a mathematician and some of the struggles of these type of careers.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.920]   And I think that's super important. - In many ways, he's a contributor to open science and open
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.800]   humanity. He's being an open human by communicating. Scott Aronson is another in computer
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.680]   science world who's a very different style, very different style, but there's something about a
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:16.080]   blog that is authentic and real and just gives us a window into the mind and soul of these brilliant
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:22.240]   folks. So it's definitely a gift. Let me ask you about Fermat's library on Twitter, which,
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.520]   I mean, I don't know how to describe it. People should definitely just follow Fermat's library
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:36.960]   on Twitter. I keep following and unfollowing Fermat's library because it's so, it gives,
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:48.800]   when I follow it leads me on down rabbit holes often that are very fruitful, but anyway, so
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:55.760]   the posts you do with the, on Twitter are just these beautiful, are things that reveal some
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:03.440]   beautiful aspect of mathematics. Is there something you could say about the approach there?
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:13.600]   And maybe broadly what you find beautiful about mathematics and then more specifically how
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:19.200]   you convert that into a rigorous process of revealing that in tweet form.
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.560]   - That's a good point. I think there's something about math that a lot of the mathematical content
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:33.760]   and papers are like little proofs, has in a way sort of an infinite half-life. What I mean by
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:40.080]   that is that if you look at like Euclid's elements, it's as valid today as it was when it was created
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:48.080]   like 2000 years ago. And that's not true for a lot of other scientific fields. And so in regards to
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:56.400]   Twitter, I think there's also a very, it's a very under-explored platform from a learning perspective.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.960]   I think if you look at content on Twitter, it's very easy to consume. It's very easy to read.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:12.080]   And especially when you're trying to explain something, we humans get a dopamine hit if we
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:18.800]   learn something new. And that's a very, very powerful feeling. And that's why people go to
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:24.640]   classes when you have a really good professor, it's looking for those dopamine hits. And
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:32.560]   that's something that we try to explore when we're producing content on Twitter. Imagine if we could,
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:37.600]   if you would, on a line to a restaurant, you could go to your phone to learn something new instead of
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:46.000]   going to a social network. And I think it's very hard to sometimes to
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:54.560]   kind of provide that feeling because you need to sometimes digest content and put it in a way that
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:02.400]   it fits 280 characters. And it requires a lot of sometimes time to do that, even though it's easy
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:08.320]   to consume, it's hard to make. But once you are able to provide that Eureka moment to people,
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:14.400]   that's very powerful to get that dopamine hit and you create this feedback cycle and people come
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.960]   back for more. And in Twitter, compared to an online course or a book, you have a 0% dropout.
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:28.480]   So people will read the content. So it's part of the creators, the person that is creating the
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:33.200]   content, if you're able to actually get that feedback cycle, it's super, super powerful.
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:39.200]   Yeah. But some of this stuff is like, how the heck do you find that? And I don't know why it's
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:49.200]   so appealing. This is from a, what is it? A couple of days ago. I'll just read out the number. 2,
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.720]   3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is the largest prime number with consecutive increasing digits.
[01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:04.640]   I mean, that is so cool. That's like some weird like glimpse into some deep universal truth,
[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:10.880]   even though it's just the number. I mean, that's like so arbitrary. Like why is it so pleasant
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:15.520]   that that's a thing? But it is in some way, it's almost like it is a little glimpse at some
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:20.880]   much bigger like. - And I think like, especially if we're
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:26.000]   talking about science, there's something unique about you go, and with a lot of the tweets,
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.800]   you go sometimes from a state of not knowing something to knowing something. And that is very
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:36.800]   particular to science, math, physics, and that again, is extra extremely addictive. And that's
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:44.320]   how I feel about that. And that's why I think people engage so much with our tweets and go
[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.440]   into rabbit holes. And then they, you start with prime numbers and all of a sudden you are spending
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:55.760]   hours reading number theory things and you go into Wikipedia and you lose a lot of time there.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.840]   - Well, the variety is really interesting too. There's human things, there's physics things,
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.400]   there's like numeric things, like I just mentioned, but there's also more rigorous mathematical
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.760]   things. There's stuff that's tied to the history of math and the proofs and there's visual,
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.800]   there's animations, there are looping animations that are incredible, that reveal something.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:26.960]   There's Andrew Wiles on being smart. This is just me now, like ignoring you guys and just going
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.480]   through your Twitter. - No, yeah, we're a bit like
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.960]   math drug dealers. We're just trying to get you hooked. We're trying to give you that hit
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:36.400]   and trying to get you hooked. - Yes, some people are brighter than
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:42.080]   others, but I really believe that most people can really get to quite a good level of mathematics
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.000]   if they're prepared to deal with these psychological issues of how to handle the
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.760]   situation of being stuck. - Yeah.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.600]   - Yeah, there's some truth to that. - That's truth. I feel that's like really,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:57.840]   it's some truth in terms of research and also about startups. You're stuck a lot of the time
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:03.440]   before you get to a breakthrough and it's difficult to endure that process of like being stuck
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.280]   because you're not trained to be in that position. I feel, yeah, that's-
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:16.960]   - Yeah, most people are broken by the stuckness or like they're distracted. I've been very
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:25.520]   cognizant of the fact that more and more social media becomes a thing, like distractions become
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:32.960]   a thing that that moment of being stuck is your mind wants to go do stuff that's unrelated to
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:40.160]   being stuck and you should be stuck. I'm referring to small stucknesses, like you're like trying to
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.800]   design something and it's a dead end, basically little dead ends, dead ends of programming,
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:51.680]   dead ends in trying to think through something. And then your mind wants to like, this is the
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:59.200]   problem with this like work-life balance culture is like take a break, like as if taking a break
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.920]   will solve everything. Sometimes it solves quite a bit, but like sometimes you need to sit in a
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.040]   stuckness and suffer a little bit and then take a break, but you definitely need to be,
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:14.640]   and like most people quit from that psychological battle of being stuck.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:22.960]   So success is people who persevere through that. - Yeah, and in the creative process,
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:28.400]   that's also true. I was, the other day I was, I think it was reading about, what is his name?
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.360]   Ed Sheeran, like the musician was talking a little bit about the creative process and he was using
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.800]   this analogy of a faucet, like where you, when you turn on a faucet, it's as like the dirty water
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:44.960]   coming out in the beginning and you just have to keep trusting that at some point your clean,
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:49.040]   clean, clear water will come out, but you have to endure that process. Like in the beginning,
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:56.880]   it's going to be dirty water and just embrace that. - Yeah, actually this, the entirety of my
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:01.120]   YouTube channel and this podcast have been following that philosophy of dirty water.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:07.200]   Like I've been, you know, I do believe that, like you have to get all the crap out of your system
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:14.240]   first. And sometimes it's all, sometimes it's all crappy work. I tend to be very self-critical,
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:19.760]   but I do think that quantity leads to quality for some people. It does for my, the way my mind
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:27.840]   works is like, just keep putting stuff out there, keep creating and the quality will come as opposed
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:34.240]   to sitting there waiting, not doing anything until the thing seems perfect. Cause the perfect may
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:41.200]   never come. - But just, just on like on, on, on our Twitter profile, I really, and sometimes when
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.120]   you look on, on some of those tweets, they might seem like pretty kind of, you know, why is this
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:53.200]   interesting? It's like, so raw, like it's just a number, but I really believe that especially with
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:59.680]   math or physics, it is possible to get everyone to love math or physics, even if you think you hate
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:04.320]   it. It's, it's not a function of the student or the person that is on the other side. I think it's
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:10.400]   just purely a function of like how you explain a hidden beauty that they hadn't realized before.
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:16.560]   It's not easy, but I think it's like, a lot of the times it's on like on the creator's side
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:22.720]   to, to be able to like show that beauty to the other person. - I think some of that is native to,
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:28.160]   to humans. We just have that curiosity and you look at small toddlers and babies and like
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.640]   them trying to figure things out. And there's just something that is born with us that we, we,
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:36.880]   we want for that understanding. We want to figure out the world around us. And, and so,
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:42.720]   yeah, it shouldn't be like, whether or not people are going, are going to, to enjoy it. Like
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:49.440]   I, I, I also really believe that everybody has that capacity to fall in love with, with math and
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:55.360]   physics. - You mentioned startup. What do you think it takes to build a successful startup?
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:03.840]   - Yeah, that it's what, what Louise was saying that you need to, to be able to endure being stuck.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:11.360]   And, and I think the best way to put it is that startups don't have a linear reward function,
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:18.000]   right? You oftentimes don't get rewarded for effort. And, and, and, and most of our lives,
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:25.360]   we go through these processes that do give you those small rewards for effort, right? In school,
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:30.560]   you study hard, generally you'll get a good grade and then you good, you get like good grades ever,
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:36.160]   or you get grades every semester. And so you're, you're slowly getting rewarded and pushed in the
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:41.600]   right direction for, for startups and startups are, are not the only thing that is like this,
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:47.280]   but for startups, it's, you know, you can put in a ton of effort into something that, and then get
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.920]   no reward for it, right? It's, it's like, like Sisyphus boulder, where you were pushing that
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:57.760]   boulder up the mountain and, and, and you get to the top and then it just rolls all the way back
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:03.120]   down. And, and so that's something that I think a lot of people are not equipped to deal with and
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:09.200]   can be incredibly demoralizing, especially if that happens more than, than a few times.
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:16.160]   And so, but I think it's absolutely essential to, to power through it because by the nature
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:22.240]   of startups, it's oftentimes, you know, you're dealing with, with, with non-obvious ideas and
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:28.320]   things that there might be contrarian. And so you're gonna, you're gonna run into, into that a
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.120]   lot. You're going to do things that are not going to work out and you need to be prepared to deal
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:37.600]   with that. But, but if we're not coming out of college, you're, you're just not equipped.
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:44.080]   I'm not sure if there's a way to train people to deal with those non-linear reward functions,
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:49.360]   but it's definitely, I think one of the most difficult things to, you know, about doing a
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:53.760]   startup. And also happens in research sometimes, you know, we're talking about the default state
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:58.240]   is being stuck. You just, you know, you don't like, you try things, you get zero results,
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:04.640]   you close doors, you constantly closing doors until you, you know, find something. And yeah,
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:10.160]   that is a big thing. - What about sort of this point when you're stuck, there's a kind of decision,
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:15.760]   whether you, if you have a vision to persist through, through with this direction that you've
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:22.720]   been going along or what a lot of startups do or businesses is pivot. How do you decide whether
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:31.520]   like to give up on a particular flavor of the way you've imagined the design and to like adjust it
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:39.200]   or completely like alter it? - I think that's a core question for startups that I've asked
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:44.640]   myself exactly. And like, I've never been able to come up with a great framework to make those
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:52.320]   decisions. I think that's really at the core of, yeah, out of a lot of the toughest questions that
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:59.280]   people that started a company have to deal with. - I think maybe the best framework that I
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:05.920]   was able to figure out is like when you run out of ideas, you just, you know, you're exploring
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.040]   something is not working, you try it in a different angle, you know, we try a different business model.
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.560]   When you run out of ideas, like you don't have any more cards, just switch. And yeah,
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.520]   it's not perfect because you also, it's, you have a lot of stories of startups was like,
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:30.240]   people kept pushing and then, you know, that paid off. And then you have philosophies,
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:36.080]   there's like fail fast and pivot fast. So it's, you know, it's hard to, you know,
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:41.120]   balance these two worlds and understand what is the best framework. - And I mean,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:46.800]   if you look at Fermat's library, you're maybe you can correct me, but it feels like you're
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:54.960]   operating in a space where there's a lot of things that are broken or could be significantly improved.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:01.200]   So it feels like there's a lot of possibilities for pivoting or like, how do you revolutionize
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:09.360]   science? How do you revolutionize the aggregation, the annotation, the commenting, the community
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.840]   around information of knowledge, structured knowledge? I mean, that's kind of what like
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:19.520]   Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange has struggled with to come up with a solution. And they've come
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:24.160]   up, I think, with an interesting set of solutions that are also, I think, flawed in some ways,
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:28.560]   but they're much, much better than the alternatives. But there's a lot of other
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.120]   possibilities. If we just look at papers, as we talked about, there's so many possible revolutions
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:38.480]   and there are a lot of money to be potentially made as revolutions, plus coupled with that,
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:43.760]   the benefit to humanity. And so like you're sitting there, like, I don't know how many
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:48.880]   people are legitimately from a business perspective, playing with these ideas. It feels like
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:51.360]   there's a lot of ideas here. - True, it varies.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:56.960]   - Are you right now grinding in a particular direction? Like, is there a five-year vision
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.000]   that you're thinking in your mind? - For us, it's more like a 20-year vision
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:10.800]   in the sense that we've consciously tried to make the decision of... So we run Formats as
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.840]   it's a side project. And it's a separate in the sense like it's not what we're working on full
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:25.280]   time. But our thesis there is that we actually think that that's a good thing, at least for
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:32.960]   this stage of Formats library. And also because some of these projects, if you're coming from
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:41.920]   a startup framework, you probably try to fit every single idea into something that can change
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:47.280]   the world within three to five years. And there's just some problems that take longer than that.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.840]   Right? And so, we were talking about archive and I'm very doubtful that you could grow
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:57.840]   like archive into what it is today, like within two or three years, no matter how much money you
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:02.560]   throw at it, there's just some things that can take longer. But you need to be able to power
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:09.520]   through the time that it takes. But if you look at it as, "Okay, this is a company, this is a
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:15.040]   startup, we have to grow fast, we have to raise money," then sometimes you might forego those
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:23.680]   ideas because of that, because they don't very well fit into the typical startup framework.
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:30.720]   And so, for us, Formats, it's something that we're okay with having it grow slowly and maybe taking
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:36.800]   many years. And that's why we think it's not a bad thing that it is a side project, because it
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:44.000]   makes it much more acceptable in a way to be able to be okay with that.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.040]   - That said, I think what happens is if you keep pushing new little features,
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:53.760]   new little ideas, I'd feel like there's like certain ideas will just become viral.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:59.920]   And then you just won't be able to help yourself, but it'll revolutionize things. It feels like
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:08.080]   there needs to be, not needs to be, but there's opportunity for viral ideas to change science.
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:08.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:13.280]   - And maybe we don't know what those are yet. It might be a very small kind of thing.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.520]   - Maybe you don't even know if, should this be a for-profit company doing this?
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.040]   - Right. It's the Wikipedia question.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:24.960]   - Yeah. There are a lot of questions, like really fundamental questions about this space
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:26.800]   that we've talked about.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:31.120]   - I mean, you take Wikipedia and you try to run it as a startup, and by now it would have a paywall,
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:34.320]   you'd be paying 9.99 a month to read more than 20 articles.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:41.440]   - I mean, that's one view. The other, the ad-driven model. So, they rejected the ad-driven model.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.600]   I don't know if we could, I mean, this is a difficult question. If Archive was supported
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:54.160]   by ads, I don't know if that's bad for Archive. If Fermat's Library was supported by ads,
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.760]   I don't know. It's not trivial to me. Unlike, I think a lot of people,
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:06.320]   I'm not against advertisements. I think ads, when done well, are really good. I think the problem
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:11.280]   with Facebook and all the social networks are the way, the lack of transparency around the way they
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:17.120]   use data and the lack of control the users have over their data. Not the fact that data is being
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:22.880]   collected and used to sell advertisements. It's the lack of transparency, lack of control. If you
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:26.560]   do a good job of that, I feel like it's a really nice way to make stuff free.
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:32.720]   - Yeah. It's like Stack Overflow, right? I mean, I think they've done a good job with that,
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:37.120]   even though, as we said, they're capturing very little of the value that they're putting out
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:44.160]   there, right? But it makes it a sustainable company and they're providing a lot of, it's a
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:49.920]   fantastic and very productive community. - Let me ask a ridiculous tangent of a
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:56.560]   question. Luis, you wrote a paper on Game of Thrones, Battle of Winterfell, just as a side
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.800]   little, I'm sorry, I noticed, I'm sure you've done a lot of ridiculous stuff like this. I just
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:06.560]   noticed that particular one. By ridiculous, I mean ridiculously awesome. Can you describe
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.240]   the approach in this work, which I believe is a legitimate publication?
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:16.480]   - So going back to the original, like when we were talking about the backstory of papers and
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:22.880]   the importance of that. So this is actually, when the last season of the show was airing,
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:32.800]   this was during a company lunch. In the last season, there's a really big battle against the
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:41.840]   forces of evil and the forces of good. And this is called the Battle of Winterfell. And in this
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:46.400]   battle, there are like these two armies, and there's a very particular thing that they have
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:52.320]   to take into account is that in the army of dead, like if someone dies in the army of the living,
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:16:00.880]   like that person is gonna be reborn as a soldier in the army of the dead. And so that was an
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.000]   important thing to take into account. - And the initial conditions, as you
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.800]   specify, it's about 100,000 on each side. - Exactly. So I was able to, like based on
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:13.040]   some images, like on previous episodes to figure out what was the size of the armies. And so what
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:19.840]   I want, what we wanted to, what we were theorizing was like, how many soldiers does like a soldier on
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:26.880]   the army of the living has to kill in order for them to be able to destroy the army of the dead
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:32.880]   without like losing, because every time one of the good soldiers dies, it's gonna turn into like
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:39.760]   the other side. And so we were theorizing that and I wrote a couple of differential equations,
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.400]   and I was able to figure out that based on the size of the armies, I think was the ratio had to
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:51.040]   be like 1.7. So it had to kill like 1.7 soldiers of like the army of the dead in order for them to
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:17:00.000]   win the battle. - Yeah, that's science. It's the most powerful. And this is also somehow a pitch
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:07.360]   for like a hiring pitch in a sense like this is the kind of important science you do at lunch.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:12.640]   - Exactly. Well, it turned out to be, you know, as for people that have watched these shows,
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.640]   it's like they know that every time you try to predict something that is gonna happen,
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.440]   it's gonna, you're gonna fail miserably. And that's what happened. So it was not at all important
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.960]   for the show, but we ended up like putting that out and there was a lot of people that shared
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:32.400]   that. I think it was some like elements of the show, the cast of the show that actually retweeted
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.960]   that and shared that. So it was fun. - I would love if this kind of calculation
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:43.040]   happened like during the making of the show or, you know, I love it like in,
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:51.200]   for example, I now know Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina, and I love it. And he doesn't seem
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:58.560]   to be some, not many people seem to do this, but I love it when directors and people who wrote the
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:05.120]   story really think through the technical details. Like whether it's knowing like how things, even
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:10.960]   if it's science fiction, if you were to try to do this, how would you do this? Like Stephen Wolfram
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:18.320]   and his son were collaborating with the movie Arrival in designing the alien language of how
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:25.680]   you communicate with the aliens. Like how would you really have a math-based language that could
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:33.280]   span the alien and being and the human being? So I love it when they have that kind of rigor.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:36.960]   - The Martian was also big on that. Like the book and the movie was all about like,
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.240]   can we actually, is this plausible? Can this happen? It was all about that.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:47.360]   - And that can really bring you in. Like sometimes the small details, I mean,
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:53.440]   the guy that wrote the Martian book is another book that is also filled with those like things
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.960]   that when you realize that, okay, these are grounded in science can just really bring you in.
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:02.800]   - Yeah. - Like he has a book about a colony on-
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.600]   - A colony on the moon. And he goes about like all the details that would be required about
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.800]   setting up a colony in the moon and like things that he wouldn't think about. Like the fact that
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:20.400]   they would, it's hard to bring like air to the moon so they wouldn't like, how do you make that
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:25.840]   breathable, that environment breathable? You need to bring oxygen, but like you probably wouldn't
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:33.280]   bring nitrogen. So what you do is like, instead of having an atmosphere that is a hundred percent
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:39.040]   oxygen, you like decrease the pressure so that you have the same ratio of oxygen on earth, but like
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:45.120]   lowering the pressure here. And so like things like water boils at the lower temperature. So
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:50.880]   people would have coffee and the coffee would be colder. Like there was a problem in this environment
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:56.880]   in the moon. So like, and these are like small things in the book, but I studied physics. So
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:04.080]   like when I read these, that throws me into like tangents and I start researching that. And it's
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:11.840]   like, I really like to read books and watch movies when they go to that level of detail about science.
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:15.840]   - Yeah. I think Interstellar was one where they also consulted heavily with a number of people.
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:17.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think even resulted in-
[02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:19.840]   - In a couple of papers. - A couple of papers about like the black
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:27.840]   hole visualizations and yeah. But there's even more examples of interesting science around like
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:34.080]   these fantasy. We were reading at some point, like these guys that were trying to figure out if
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:43.040]   the Tolkien's middle earth, if it was round, if it was like a sphere, if it was like a flat earth.
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:46.160]   - Based on the map. - Based on the map and some of the
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:51.680]   references in the books. And so- - Yeah, we actually, I think we tweeted
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:53.040]   about that. - Yeah, we did.
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:58.480]   - Based on the distance between the cities, you can actually prove that that could be like a map
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:03.760]   of a sphere or like a spheroid and you can actually calculate the radius of that planet.
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:12.080]   - That's fascinating. I mean, yeah, that's fascinating. But there's something about like
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:20.320]   calculating the number, like exactly the calculation you did for the battle of Winterfell
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:27.520]   is something fascinating about that because that's not like being, that's very mathematical versus
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:34.720]   grounded in physics. And that's really interesting. I mean, that's like injecting mathematics into
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:40.320]   fantasy. There's something magical about that. - I see what you're saying. And that for me,
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:47.200]   that's why I think it's also when you look at things like Fermat's Last Theorem, like problems
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:52.640]   that are very kind of self-contained and simple to state. I think like that's the same with that
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:22:01.360]   paper. It's very easy to understand the boundaries of the problem. And that for me, that's why math
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:06.400]   is so appealing. And those like problems are also so appealing to the general public. It's not that
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:12.400]   they look simple or that people think that they're easy to like solve, but I feel that a lot of the
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:18.240]   times they are almost intellectually democratic because everyone understands the starting point.
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:24.000]   You know, you look at Fermat's Last Theorem, everyone understands like, this is the universe
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.440]   of the problem. And the same, maybe with that paper, everyone understands, okay, these are
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:34.640]   the starting conditions. And yeah, the fact that it becomes intellectually democratic, and I think
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:40.160]   that's a huge motivation for people. And that's why so many people gravitate towards these like
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.560]   Riemann hypotheses or Fermat's Last Theorem or that simple paper, which is like just one page.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:48.880]   It was very simple. - And I just talked to somebody, I don't know if you know who he is,
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:58.080]   Jocko Willink, who is this person who among many things loves military tactics. So he would
[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:04.000]   probably either publish a follow-on paper, maybe you guys should collaborate, but he would see the
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.960]   fundamental, the basic assumptions that he started that paper with is flawed because, you know,
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:15.280]   there's like dragons too, right? There's like, you have to integrate tactics because it's not
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:20.880]   a homogeneous system. - I don't take into account the dragons and like- - And he would say tactics
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:26.280]   fundamentally change the dynamics of the system. And so like- - That's what happened. (laughs)
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:31.840]   - So yeah, so at least from a scientific perspective, he was right, but he never
[02:23:31.840 --> 02:23:36.400]   published, so there you go. Let me ask the most important question. You guys are from
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:44.320]   Portugal, both? - Yeah. - So who is the greatest soccer player, footballer of all time?
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:50.160]   - Yeah, I think we're a little bit biased on this topic, but I mean- - Maradona?
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:56.880]   - I have a huge, I have a tremendous respect for what- - Here we go.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:23:58.960]   (laughs) - This is the political-
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.440]   - We can convince you. - I mean, I have tremendous respect for what
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:08.960]   Ronaldo has achieved in his career. And I think soccer is one of those sports where I think you
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:15.520]   can get to maybe be one of the best players in the world if you just have like natural talent.
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:20.880]   And even if you don't put a lot of hard work and discipline into soccer, you can be one of
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:26.000]   the best players in the world. And I think Ronaldo is kind of like, of course, he's naturally talented,
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.200]   but he also- - Cristiano Ronaldo,
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:32.320]   say the football from Portugal. - Exactly, from Portugal, and not the
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:38.960]   Brazilian in this case. And Ronaldo came from nothing. He's known from being probably one of
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:44.320]   the hardest working athletes in the game. And I see that sometimes a lot of these discussions about
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:51.760]   the best player, a lot of people tend to gravitate towards like, this person is naturally talented
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:59.360]   and the other person has to work hard. And so, as if it was bad, if he had to work hard to be good
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:07.520]   at something. And I think so many people fall into that trap. And the reason why so many people fall
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:14.480]   into that trap is because if you're saying that someone is good and achieved a lot of success by
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:20.000]   working hard, as opposed to achieving success because he has some sort of God-given natural
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.040]   talent that you can't explain why the person was born with that. What does it tell you about you?
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:31.280]   It tells you that maybe if you work hard on a lot of fields, you could accomplish a lot of great
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.160]   things. And I think that's hard to digest for a lot of people. - So in that way, Ronaldo is
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:37.600]   inspiring that- - I think so.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:41.760]   - So you find hard work inspiring, but he's way too good looking. That's the-
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:45.120]   - Yeah, yeah. - I don't like him probably.
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.760]   - No, I like the part of the hard work and like of him being like one of the hardest working
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:53.920]   athletes in soccer. - So he is to you the greatest of all time?
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.760]   Is he up to, is he will be number, okay. - I agree.
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:59.360]   - Do you concur with this? - I disagree.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.880]   - Well, I definitely disagree. I mean, I like him very much. He works hard. I admire,
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:15.280]   I admire, you know, what, like he's incredible goal scorer, right? But I,
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:22.000]   so first of all, Leo Messi, and there was some confusion because I've kept saying Maradona is
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:30.800]   my favorite player, but I think Leo has surpassed them. So it's Messi, then Maradona, then
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:40.400]   PelÃ© for me. But the reason is, there's certain aesthetic definitions of beauty that I admire,
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.720]   whether it came by hard work or through God given talent or through anything. It doesn't really
[02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:53.840]   amount to me. There's certain aesthetic, like genius when I see it to me, and especially it
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:59.360]   doesn't have to be consistent. It is in the case of Messi, in the case of Ronaldo, but just even
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:06.640]   moments of genius, which is where Maradona really shines. - Even if that doesn't translate into like
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:10.400]   results and goals being scored. - Right, right. And that's the challenge.
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:17.520]   I'm like, I did that because that's where people that tell me that Leo Messi's never,
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:24.080]   even on strong teams have led his, the national team, people aspire to the world cup, right?
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:29.680]   That's really important. And to me, no, it's the moment, like winning to me was never important.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:37.920]   What's more important is the moments of genius. And, but you're talking to the human story and
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.640]   yeah, Cristiano Ronaldo definitely has a beautiful human story.
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:49.920]   - Yeah. And I think you can't, for me, it's hard to decouple those two. I don't just look at the
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.960]   list of achievements, but I like how he got there and how he keeps pushing the boundaries. It's like
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:28:00.960]   almost 40 and how that sets up an example. Like maybe 10 years ago, I wouldn't have ever imagined
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.280]   that like one of the top players in the world could be a top player at like 37 or.
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:09.520]   - But so, and there's an interesting, the human story is really important, but like,
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:16.240]   if you look at Ronaldo, he's like, he's somebody like kids could aspire to be. But at the same
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:23.280]   time, I also like Maradona who like is a tragic figure in many ways. It's like the, you know,
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:29.920]   the drugs, the temper, all of those things, that's beautiful too. Like I don't necessarily think to
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:39.120]   me, the flaws are beautiful too. And athletes, I don't think you need to be perfect from a
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:44.720]   personality perspective. Those flaws are also beautiful. So, but yeah, there is something about
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:52.640]   hard work and there's also something about the being an underdog and being able to carry a team.
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:59.040]   That's an argument from Maradona. I don't know if you can make that argument for Messi and Ronaldo
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:05.760]   either, 'cause they've all played on superstar teams for most of their lives. So I don't know
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:15.200]   how, you know, it's difficult to know how they would do when they had to work, like did what
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:22.000]   Maradona had to do to carry a team on his shoulders. And PelÃ© did as well, depending on the
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.720]   context. - Maybe you could argue that with the Portuguese national team, but we have a good team.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:33.200]   Yeah, but maybe with what Maradona did with, you know, Naples and a couple other teams,
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:37.040]   it's incredible. - It speaks to the beauty of the game that, you know, we're talking about
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:41.040]   all these different players that have, or especially, you know, if you're comparing
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.280]   Messi and Ronaldo, they have such different, you know, styles of play and also even
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:54.160]   their bodies are so different. But these two very different players can be at the top of the game.
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:30:00.000]   And that's not, there are not a lot of other sports where you have that, you know, like you
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:06.400]   have kind of a mental image of a basketball player and like the top basketball players kind of fit
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:15.120]   that mental image and they look a certain way. But for soccer, there's, it's not so much like
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:21.920]   that. And I think that's beautiful, but that really adds something to the sport. - Well,
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:26.160]   do you play soccer yourself? Have you played that in your life? What do you find beautiful
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:30.960]   about the game? - Yeah, I mean, it's one of the, I'd say it's the biggest sport in Portugal. And
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:35.520]   so growing up, we played a lot. - Did you see the paper from DeepMind? I didn't look at it,
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:42.160]   where they're like doing some analysis on soccer strategy. - Yeah, interesting. - I saved that
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:48.640]   paper. I haven't read it yet. It's actually, when I was in college, I actually did some
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:57.440]   research on applying machine learning and statistics in sports. In our case, we're doing
[02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:05.440]   it for basketball. But what they're effectively trying to do was, have you ever watched Moneyball?
[02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:10.640]   So they're trying to do something similar, right? Taking that, in this case, basketball,
[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:17.840]   taking a statistical approach to basketball. The interesting thing there is that baseball is much
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:22.960]   more about having these discrete events that happen kind of in similar conditions. And so it's easier
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:28.080]   to take a statistical approach to it. Whereas basketball, it's a much more dynamic game.
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:36.800]   It's harder to measure. It's hard to replicate these conditions. And so you have to think about
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:41.600]   it in a slightly different way. And so we were doing work on that and working like with the
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:46.720]   Celtics to analyze the data that they had. Like they had these cameras in the arena, they were
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:51.120]   tracking the players. And so they had a ton of data, but they didn't really know what to do with
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:58.960]   it. And so we were doing work on that. And soccer is maybe even a step further. It's a game where
[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:03.360]   you don't have as many... In basketball, you have a lot of field goals. And so you can measure
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:11.120]   success. Soccer, it's more of a poisson process almost, where it's like you have a goal or two
[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:15.120]   in a game. In terms of metrics, I wonder if there's a way... And I've actually have thought
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:19.840]   about this in the past, never coming up with any good solution. If there's a way to definitively
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:24.160]   say whether it's messy or not, they're the greatest of all time. Honestly, measure,
[02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:30.880]   like convert the game of soccer into metrics, like you said, baseball. But those moments of genius,
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:38.800]   if it's just about goals or passes that led to goals, that feels like it doesn't capture
[02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:48.080]   the genius of the play. You have more metrics, for instance, in chess, and you can try to
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:56.080]   understand how hard of a move that was. There's Bobby Fischer has this move that I think it's
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:33:01.680]   called the move of the century, where you have to go so deep into the tree to understand that
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:06.560]   that was the right move and you can quantify how hard it was. So it'd be interesting to try to
[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:10.720]   think of those types of metrics, but say, yeah, for soccer. - Computer vision unlocks some of that
[02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:15.840]   for us. That's one possibility. - I have a cool idea, a computer vision product, Lex, that you
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:22.640]   could build for soccer. - Let's go. I'm taking notes. - If you could detect the ball and imagine
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:29.120]   that... It seems totally doable right now, but if you could detect when the ball enters one of the
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:35.680]   goals and just had a crowd cheering for you when you're playing soccer with your friends, every
[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:42.080]   time you score a goal, or you had the Champions League song going on, and having that, you go play
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:46.320]   soccer with your friends, you just turn that on and there's a computer vision program analyzing
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:49.680]   the ball. - Detects the ball. - Detects the ball every time there's a goal. If you miss, there's
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:55.280]   the fans are reacting to that. - And then... - Should be pretty simple by now. I think there's
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:59.920]   an opportunity there. Just throwing that. - I'm going to go all out. By the way, I did...
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:04.640]   I've never released... I was thinking of just putting it on GitHub, but I did write exactly
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:10.240]   that, which is the trackers for the players, for the bodies of the player. This is the hard part,
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:19.040]   actually. The detection of player bodies and the ball is not hard. What's hard is very robust
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:26.560]   tracking through time of each of those. So I wrote a tracker that's pretty damn good. - Is that
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:30.240]   open source? You open source? - No, I've never released it. - Interesting. - Because I thought
[02:34:31.920 --> 02:34:37.520]   I need to... This is the perfection thing, because I knew it was going to be like...
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:44.080]   It's going to pull me in and it wasn't really that done. And so I've never actually been part
[02:34:44.080 --> 02:34:48.080]   of a GitHub project where it's like really active development. - Interesting. - And I didn't want
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.720]   to make it... I knew there's a non-zero probability that it will become my life for like a half a
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:58.800]   year. That's just how much I love soccer and all those kinds of things. And ultimately, it will be
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:05.760]   all for just the joy of analyzing the game, which I'm all for. - I remember you also, in one of the
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:11.040]   episodes, you mentioned that you did also a lot of eye tracking analysis on Joe Rogan. - That was
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.280]   the research side of my life. - Interesting. And you have that library, right? You kind of
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.720]   downloaded all the episodes. - Allegedly. And of course I didn't, if you're a lawyer and listening
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:25.200]   to this. - I was listening to the episode where you mentioned that and I was actually... There
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:32.080]   was something that I might ask you for access to that, to allegedly that library. But I was
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:38.880]   doing some, not regarding like eye tracking, but I was playing around with analyzing the distribution
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:46.560]   of silences on one of the Joe Rogan episodes. So I did that for the Elon conversation, where it's
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:52.240]   like, you just take all the silences, after Joe asked the question and Elon responded, and you
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:59.200]   plot that distribution and see how that looks like. - Yeah, I think there's a huge opportunity,
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:05.600]   especially with long form podcasts, to do that kind of analysis, bigger than Joe. - Exactly. It
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:10.400]   has to be a fairly unedited podcast so that you don't cut the silences. - So one of the benefits
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:17.840]   I have doing this podcast is, what we're recording today is there's individual audio that's being
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.960]   recorded. So I have the raw information, when it's published, it's all combined together,
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:28.000]   and individual video feeds. So even when you're listening, which I usually do, I only show one
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:37.520]   video stream, I can track your blinks and so on. But ultimately, the hope is you don't need that
[02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:41.920]   raw data, because if you don't need the raw data for whatever analysis you're doing, you can then
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:47.040]   do a huge number of podcasts. It's quickly growing now, the number, especially comedians,
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:54.400]   there's quite a few comedians with long form podcasts, and they have a lot of facial
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:37:00.000]   expressions, they have a lot of fun and all those kinds of things, and it's prone for analysis. -
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.800]   There's so many interesting things. That idea actually sparked because I was watching
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:12.960]   a Q&A by Steve Jobs, and I think it was at MIT. And then, people did a talk there, and then
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:18.400]   the Q&A started, and people started asking questions. I was working while listening to it,
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:23.760]   and someone asked a question, and he goes on a 20-second silence before answering the question.
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:31.840]   I had to check if the video hadn't paused or something. And I was thinking about if that
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:37.680]   is a feature of a person, how long on average you take to respond to a question, and if it's like-
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:40.800]   - Oh, that's fascinating. - Has to do with how thoughtful you are,
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:44.720]   and if that changes over time. - But it also could be, this is a really
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:49.440]   fascinating metric, 'cause it also could be, it's certainly a feature of a person, but it's also a
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:51.040]   function of the question. - True.
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:55.680]   - Like, if you normalize to the person, you can probably infer a bunch of stuff about the
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.640]   question. So, it's a nice flag, like it's a really strong signal, the length of that silence,
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:06.480]   relative to the usual silence they have. So, one, the silence is a measure of how thoughtful they
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.040]   are, and two, the particular silence is a measure how- - Thoughtful the question was.
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.600]   - Thoughtful the question was. It's really interesting. I mean, yeah.
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:21.040]   - Yeah. I just analyzed Elon's episode, but I think there's room for exploration there.
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:25.840]   - I feel like the average for comedians would be, I mean, the time would be so small,
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.160]   'cause you're trained to, I would think you're reacting to hecklers, you're reacting to all
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:34.640]   sorts of things, you have to be so quick. - Maybe, maybe. Yeah. But some of the greatest
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:41.040]   comedians are very good at sitting in the silence. I mean, there's Louis CK, they play with that,
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:49.760]   'cause you have a rhythm. Like Dave Chappelle, a comedian who did a Joe show recently,
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:56.400]   he has a, especially when he's just having a conversation, he does long pauses. It's kind
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:04.320]   of cool. It's one of the ways to have people hang in your word, is to play with the pauses.
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:11.200]   To play with the silences and the emphasis and mid-sentence. There's a bunch of different things
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:17.520]   that it'd be interesting to really, really analyze, but still soccer to me is, that one's
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:23.520]   fascinating. I just want a conclusive, definitive statement about, 'cause there's so many
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:31.040]   soccer highlights of both Messi and Ronaldo. I just feel like the raw data is there.
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:35.440]   - In jest, and decide. - Definitive statement.
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:38.800]   'Cause you don't have that with PelÃ© and Mardona. - Yeah, true.
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:43.840]   - But here's a huge amount of high-def data, the annoying, the difficult thing,
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.920]   and this is really hard for tracking. And this is actually where I kind of gave up.
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:57.360]   I didn't really give much effort, but I gave up to the way that highlights or usually football
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:03.360]   match filmed is they switch the camera. So they'll do a different switch perspective. So you have to,
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.280]   it's a really interesting computer vision problem. When the perspective is switched,
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.320]   you still have a lot of overlap about the players, but the perspective is sufficiently different that
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:19.600]   you have to like recompute everything. So there's two ways to solve this. One is doing it the full
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.480]   way where you're constantly doing the slam problem. You're doing a 3D reconstruction the whole time,
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.960]   and projecting into that 3D world. But you could also, there could be some hacks.
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:35.360]   Then I wonder like some trick where you can hop, like when the perspective shifts,
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:42.480]   do a high probability tracking hops from one object to another. But I thought,
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:50.960]   especially in exciting moments when you're passing players, like you're doing a single ball dribble
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:56.000]   across players and you switch perspective, which is when they often do when you're making a run on
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:01.040]   goal. If you switch your perspective, it feels like that's going to be really tricky to get right
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:06.640]   automatically. But in that case, for instance, I feel like if somebody released that data set,
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:13.440]   where it's like, you just have all like this data set, a massive data set of all these games from
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:19.680]   say Ronaldo and Messi, like, and you just add that in like whatever, CSV format and some publicly
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:25.120]   available data set like that. I feel like people would just, there would be so many cool things
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:29.360]   that you could do with it. And you just set it free and then like the world would like do its
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.480]   thing. And then like interesting things would come out of it. - By the way, I have this data set. So
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:42.320]   the two things I've did of this scale is soccer. So it's body pose and ball tracking for soccer.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:49.120]   And then it's the pupil tracking and blink tracking for, it was Joe Rogan and a few other
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:54.400]   podcasts that I did. So those are the two data sets I have. - Did you analyze any of your podcasts?
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:42:04.080]   - No, I think I really started doing this podcast after doing that work and it's difficult to,
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:12.800]   maybe I'd be afraid of what I find. I'm already annoyed with my own voice and video,
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:18.880]   like editing it. But perhaps that's the honest thing to do. 'Cause one useful thing about doing
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:24.480]   computer vision about myself is like, I know what I was thinking at the time. So you can start to
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:32.000]   connect the particular, the behavioral peculiarities of like the way you blink, the way
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:39.520]   you squint, the way you close your eyes, like talking about details. It's like, for example,
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:46.240]   I just closed my eyes. Is that a blink or no? Like figuring that out in terms of timing, in terms of
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:53.920]   the blink dynamics is tricky. It's very doable. I think there's universal laws about what is a blink
[02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:59.920]   and what is a closed eye and all those things, plus makeup and eyelashes. I actually have
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:05.200]   annoyingly long eyelashes. So I remember when I was doing a lot of this work, I would cut off my
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:11.040]   eyelashes, which when like, especially it was funny, like female colleagues were like, what the
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.240]   fuck are you doing? Like, no, keep the eyelashes. But it, cause it got in the way, made the computer
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.240]   vision a lot more difficult, but. - Super interesting topics.
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:26.400]   - Yeah. But speaking about the one, still on the topic of the data sets for sports, there's one,
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:35.440]   one paper and I actually edited it on format and it's, it was published in 90s, 90s, I believe,
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:43.920]   90s or 80s, I forget. But the researcher was effectively looking at the hot end phenomena
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:48.960]   in basketball, right? So whether like the fact that you just made a field goal,
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:54.400]   if, you know, if on your next attempt, if you're more likely to make it or not.
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:44:01.200]   And it was super interesting cause I mean, he pulled like, I think a hundred undergrads and
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.320]   I think from Stanford and Cornell and asking people like, do you, do you think that's, that
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.880]   do you have a higher likelihood of making your free throw if you just, just made one? And I think
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:20.240]   it was like 68, 68% said yes, they believe that. And then he looked at the data and this was back
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:25.600]   in, as I said, like few decades ago. And so I think he had the data set of about, he looked at
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:30.960]   it specifically for free throws and he had a data set of about 5,000 free throws. And
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:37.280]   and effectively what he found was that specifically in the case of free throws,
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:44.800]   he didn't, for the aggregate data, he didn't find that he couldn't really spot that correlation,
[02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:50.480]   that hot end correlation. So if you made the first one, you weren't more likely to, to make
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:54.400]   the second one. What he did find was that they were just better at the second one,
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:59.920]   because you just got like maybe a tiny practice and you just attempted once and then, and then
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:04.320]   you're going to be better at the next one. And then I, I, then I went and there's a data set
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:11.440]   on Kaggle that has like 600,000 free throws. And I re-ran the, the same computations and,
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:16.080]   and, and confirmed, like, you can see a very clear pattern that they're just better
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:20.080]   at their second free throw. - That's interesting. Cause I think there's
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:25.200]   similar, that kind of analysis is so awesome. Cause I think with tennis, they have like,
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:30.000]   like a fault, like when you serve, they have analysis of like, are you most likely to miss
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:35.200]   the second serve if you missed the first, obviously. I think that's the case. So that
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:41.440]   integrates, that's so cool when psychology is converted into metrics in that way. And in sports,
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:46.640]   it's especially cool because it's such a constrained system that you can really study
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.520]   human psychology because it's repeated, it's constrained. So many things are controlled,
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:57.200]   which is something you rarely have in, in the wild psychological experiments. So it's cool.
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:01.600]   Plus everyone loves it. Like sports is really cool to analyze.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:08.800]   - People actually care about the results. - Yeah. I still think, well, like I,
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:12.560]   I know we'll definitely publish this work on Messi versus Ronaldo and
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:15.840]   objective, fully objective. - I'd love to peer review.
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:26.560]   Yeah, this is very true. This is not past peer review. Let me ask sort of an advice question
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:32.880]   to the young folks. You've explored a lot of fascinating ideas in your life. You built a
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:38.640]   startup, worked on physics, worked in computer science. What advice would you give to young
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:46.000]   people today in high school, maybe early college about life, about career, about science and
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:51.520]   mathematics? - I remember like, I read, like, I remember
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:47:00.320]   reading that PoincarÃ© was once asked by a French journal about his advice for young people and
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:05.200]   what was his teaching philosophy. And he said that like, one of the most important things that
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:11.360]   parents should teach their kids is how to be enthusiastic in regards to like the mysteries
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.480]   of the world. And that he said, like, striking that balance was actually one of the most important
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:21.200]   things between like in education, you know, you want to have your kids be enthusiastic about the
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.640]   mysteries of the world, but you also don't want to traumatize them. Like if you really force them
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:32.640]   into something. And I think like, especially if you're young, I think you should be curious.
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:40.320]   And I think you should explore that curiosity to the fullest, to the point where you even become
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:46.400]   almost as an expert on that topic. And you might start with something that it's small,
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:50.720]   like you might start with, you know, you're interested in numbers and how to factor numbers
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:56.160]   into primes. And then all of a sudden you go and you're like lost in number theory and you
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:01.520]   discover cryptography. And then all of a sudden you're buying Bitcoin. And I think you should do
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:06.800]   this. You should really try to fulfill this curiosity and you should live in a society that
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:12.000]   allows you to fulfill this curiosity, which is also important. And I think you should do this
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:17.360]   not to get to some sort of status or fame or money, but I think this is the way, this iterative
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:23.760]   process, I think this is the way to find happiness. And I think this is also allows you to find the
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:29.440]   meaning for your life. I think it's all about like being curious and being able to fulfill
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:36.560]   that curiosity and that path to fulfilling that, your curiosity. - Yeah, the star small,
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:40.320]   the fire build is kind of interesting way to think about it. - And you never know where you're
[02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:46.800]   going to end up. It's like, for us, Formaz is just a really good example. We started like by
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:52.080]   doing this as an internal like thing that we did in the company. And then we started putting out
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:56.960]   there and now a lot of people follow it and know about it. And so... - And you still don't know
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:02.880]   where Formaz library is going to end up actually. - True, exactly. So yeah, I think that would be my
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:10.800]   piece of advice with very limited experience, of course, but yeah, I agree. - I agree. I mean,
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:15.920]   is there something from particular, Joao, from the computer science versus physics perspective,
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:22.320]   do you regret not doing physics? Do you regret not doing computer science? Which one is the
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:29.920]   wiser, the better human being? This is Messi versus Ronaldo. Those are very, I don't know
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:35.280]   if you would agree, but they're kind of different disciplines. - True. - Yeah. - Very much so.
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:45.280]   I actually, I had that question in my mind. I took physics classes as an undergrad or like
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:51.520]   besides what I had to take. And it's definitely something that I considered at some point.
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:50:04.720]   And I do feel like later in life, that might be something that I'm not sure if regret is the right
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.840]   word, but it's kind of something that I can imagine in an alternative universe, what would
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:18.480]   have happened if I had gone into physics. I try to think that like, well, it depends on what your
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:25.360]   path ends up being, but that it's not super important, right? Like exactly what you decide to
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:34.160]   major on. I think Tim Urban, the blogger had a good visualization of this where it's like,
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:40.480]   he has a picture where you have all sorts of paths that you could pursue in your life. And then
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:44.480]   maybe you're in the middle of it. And so there's maybe some paths that are not accessible to you,
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.960]   but like the tree that is still in front of you, it gives you a lot of optionality. And so-
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:53.440]   - There's two lessons to learn from that. Like we have a huge number of options now,
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:51:02.960]   and probably you're just one to reflect, like to try to derive wisdom from the one little path
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:07.040]   you've taken so far may be flawed because there's all these other paths you could have taken.
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:12.400]   So it's like, so one, it's inspiring that you can take any path now. And two,
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:18.880]   it's like the path you've taken so far is just one of many possible ones. But it does seem that
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:24.800]   physics and computer science both open a lot of doors and a lot of different doors.
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:26.480]   - True. - It's very interesting.
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:32.080]   - It is. I feel like in this case, and especially in our case, because I could see the difference.
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:38.080]   I studied, I went to college in Europe and JoÃ£o went to college here in the US. So I could see
[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:43.760]   the difference in like, the European system is more rigid in the sense that when you decide
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:47.200]   to study physics, you don't have a lot, especially in the early years, you don't have a lot of,
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:52.880]   you can't choose to take like a class from like computer science course or something like that.
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:56.640]   You don't have a lot of freedom to explore in that sense in university, as opposed to here
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:02.880]   in the US where you have more freedom. And I think that's important. I think that's what
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:09.120]   constitutes a good kind of educational system is one that gravitates towards the interests of a
[02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:14.480]   student as you progress. But I think in order for you to do that, you need to explore different
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:19.680]   areas. And I felt like if I had a chance to take say more computer science class when I was in
[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:24.800]   college, I would have probably have taken those classes. But yeah, but I ended up like focusing
[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:30.960]   maybe too much in physics. And I think here, at least my perception is that you can explore more
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:39.440]   fields. - But there is a kind of, it's funny, but physics can be difficult. So I don't see too many
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:46.400]   computer science people then exploring into physics. It's like the one, not the one, but
[02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:54.160]   one of the beneficial things of physics, it feels like it, what was it, Rutherford that said like,
[02:52:54.160 --> 02:53:00.640]   like basically that physics is the hard thing and everything is easy. So like there's a certain
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:05.600]   sense once you've figured out some basic like physics, that it's not that you need the tools
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:11.280]   of physics to understand the other disciplines. It's that you're empowered by having done difficult
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:17.600]   shit. I mean, the ultimate, I think is probably mathematics there. - Yeah, true. - So maybe just
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:22.080]   doing difficult things and proving to yourself that you can do difficult things, whatever those
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:27.120]   are. - That's net positive, I believe. - Net positive. - Yeah. And I think like, before I
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:34.000]   started a company, I worked in the financial sector for a bit. And I think having a physics
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:40.000]   background, I felt I was not afraid of learning finance things. And I think when you come from
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.960]   those backgrounds, you are generally not afraid of stepping into other fields and learning about
[02:53:44.960 --> 02:53:52.320]   those because I feel they've learned a lot of difficult things and that's an added benefit,
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:54:00.480]   I believe. - This was an incredible conversation, Luis, JoÃ£o. We started with, who do we start
[02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:05.360]   with? Feynman, ended up with Messi and Ronaldo. So this is like the perfect conversation. It's
[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:09.600]   really an honor that you guys would waste all this time with me today. It was really fun. Thanks
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:13.840]   for talking. - Thank you so much for having us. Yeah, thank you so much. - Thanks for listening
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:20.880]   to this conversation with Luis and JoÃ£o Batala. And thank you to Skiff, SimplySafe, Indeed, NetSuite
[02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:26.560]   and Four Sigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this podcast. And now
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:31.280]   let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman. "Nobody ever figures out what life is
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:37.600]   all about and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:43.280]   if you go into it deeply enough." Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
