[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   [music]
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.280]   Well, God was at work in my life when he saved me.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.640]   Amen.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.640]   But was God at work in my life before I came to Christ?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.040]   And if so, how should we talk about God's work in our lives before conversion?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.280]   What does that season of my life before Christ tell the world about who God is?
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.000]   I've never really considered this, to be honest, and I suspect most of us haven't given that much thought either.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Well, the Apostle Paul did, and he spoke with specificity about what his pre-conversion life
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.880]   displayed about the character of God.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.720]   Here's the sharp question from a listener named Sean, who lives in Canada.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   "Hello, Pastor John. I have a question concerning the life that we as believers in Christ lived before we came to faith.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.720]   Paul writes about his life before conversion as being one of the largest opponents of God."
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   1 Timothy 1:13.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.240]   He later says his life as an unbeliever was used to display God's perfect patience.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.040]   Going from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800]   1 Timothy 1:16.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.400]   God was revealing himself in Paul's pre-conversion life, his patience.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.280]   So looking at Paul's testimony, my question is this.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.960]   Was God present and active in our lives when we were unbelievers?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.760]   And should we too speak of what our pre-conversion life reveals about the character of God?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.520]   Because quite honestly, that's something I really don't do.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.880]   The answer to both of those questions is yes.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.080]   God is always at work in this world, in everybody's life.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.640]   Ephesians 1:11, "He works all things according to the counsel of his will."
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:06.080]   And when we come to Christ, we are given a perspective on that prior work, which is true and helpful.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.200]   It is a cause for thankfulness in us, thankfulness.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   And it's a cause for a benefit to others.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.280]   In other words, we experience it as worship, and we experience it, hopefully, as witness.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   Before we turn to Christ, there is, so to speak, a veil over our eyes,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   so that we can't interpret what's happening in our lives in its proper relationship to God before we're a Christian.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.160]   In a profound sense, we are blind to what God is doing in our lives.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.720]   So we can't tell any true stories about God's work in our lives
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   before our eyes are open to see what he's really doing in our lives.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:59.840]   But when we come to Christ, the veil is lifted, and we see our past life for what it really is,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.120]   both in its darkness and in the bright light of God's work in it.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200]   So here's the text that makes that amazingly clear.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.920]   This is John 3:19-21.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.000]   "This is the judgment.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.400]   The light has come into the world, and people love the darkness rather than the light,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.320]   because their works were evil.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.680]   For everyone who does wicked things hates the light, does not come to the light,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.720]   lest his works should be exposed.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.360]   But whoever does what is true comes to the light,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.480]   so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.320]   That's interesting. That's really significant.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.240]   In other words, when a person turns to Christ and comes into the light,
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.560]   he is able to see not only the path that is in front of him
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.360]   and how he should walk now that he's a Christian,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.720]   but he is also able to see for the first time what was really going on in his life
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.600]   before he was led to Christ and crossed over the line between unbelief and belief.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.960]   The light of Christ shines in both directions.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.320]   It shines forward to show us how to live, and it shines backward
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.440]   to show how God worked in our lives to bring us to himself.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.680]   Now, one of the remarkable things about the passage in 1 Timothy 1, verses 12 to 16,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.240]   is that Paul shows that there's a double reason for why we should think about
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.800]   God's work in our lives before we became Christians—a double reason.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   One is thankfulness.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.600]   It should cause us, when we look back and watch the providences of God in our lives
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.560]   bringing us to him, it should cause us to worship and be amazed at the great mercy of God
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   that he did not let us go our own self-destructive way.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.640]   For example, Paul begins the paragraph in verse 12 of 1 Timothy 1,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.760]   "I thank him"—that's the way he begins—"I thank him
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.760]   who has given me strength." So Paul worships.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's his first response when he looks back on what God did in his life.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   If any of us rightly understands our true condition
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.920]   before we were called into Christ, we will respond the same.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.040]   Oh, yes, we will.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   Whether you were six years old or 66 or 86 when converted,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.520]   the Bible makes clear, even if our memory doesn't, the Bible makes clear
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.720]   that we were hopelessly dead in our sin and were made alive by sovereign grace.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.360]   But the main thing Paul is doing in 1 Timothy when he recalls his former life
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.720]   as a blasphemer, persecutor, insolent, the main thing he's doing
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   is trying to help others who are despairing of their own salvation
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.840]   because their past life is so terrible they can't imagine God ever being patient
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.120]   and merciful with them.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.960]   Those are the people he's really writing for when he talks about his past.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480]   And Paul's point in telling of God's work in his own past is to encourage them.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   No one is beyond hope.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.960]   Here's the way he does it.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.880]   "I was a blasphemer," this is verse 16 of 1 Timothy 1.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   "I was a blasphemer, persecutor, insolent opponent,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.600]   but I received mercy for this reason,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:09.840]   that in me as the foremost, Jesus might display his perfect patience
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   as an example to those who are to believe in him for eternal life."
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.200]   In other words, he speaks of God's work in his pre-conversion life
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.440]   first in order to celebrate the greatness of God's mercy
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   and second in order to help strugglers who have no hope.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.120]   He wants them to have hope.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.000]   He did the same thing in Galatians chapter 1.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   He knew that the churches of Galatia were struggling
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.400]   with whether they could really trust Paul as an authentic apostle.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:56.160]   And one of the ways that he helped them trust him and his gospel as true
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.440]   was to tell the story of his past life in Judaism
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.480]   and how the only reasonable explanation of why he's risking his life now
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.840]   to advance the faith he formerly tried to destroy
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   is Christ's amazing intervention in his life.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.000]   Here's what he says,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.160]   "You have heard of my former life in Judaism,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.480]   how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.000]   and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.840]   So extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.920]   but when he who had set me apart before I was born
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.040]   and who called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son to me
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.880]   in order that I might preach among the Gentiles,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.600]   did that, I did not immediately consult with anyone,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.400]   but I went away to Arabia and returned to Damascus."
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.360]   So before he was converted and before he became an apostle,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.920]   God set him apart from his mother's womb.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.040]   Second, God allowed Paul to become a radical anti-Christian zealot
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.520]   with zeal that surpassed everybody.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.480]   Three, Christ appeared to him on the Damascus road and saved him.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.040]   Four, Christ led him away to Arabia and turned him into a mighty apostle.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:34.080]   All that recounting of his past was to help the Galatians know he was true,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:43.600]   he was an apostle, and that they could trust his message, his gospel, and hope in the truth.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.240]   So the answer to Sean's questions are yes and yes.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.720]   One, yes.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.240]   Was God present and active within our lives when we were unbelievers?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.040]   Yes.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.200]   Two, should we speak of what our pre-conversion life reveals about God?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.560]   Yes.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.520]   And for those two reasons, both for the glory of God in our own thankfulness and praises,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:20.400]   and for the good of others who might be helped to have hope in Christ by our story.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.160]   Wonderful.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   And Sean, thanks for the sharp question.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.600]   And if you have a question that's good, I want it.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.120]   Send it to us through our website at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.920]   On Friday, we return to this general text, to 1 Timothy 1.15,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.440]   because Paul here calls himself the foremost sinner.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.520]   And a number of you have emailed in over the years to ask if Paul really was
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.240]   the world's worst sinner, as he claims here, or is this hyperbole?
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.520]   That's on Friday in APJ 1905.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.760]   But first up, speaking of putting our testimony into words to share with others,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.320]   on Wednesday, the next time we're together, we're going to hear a fascinating story of
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.000]   Pastor John doing this very thing to share the gospel with his next door neighbor.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.040]   This is a rare extended story from Pastor John, and I was encouraged by it,
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.520]   and I think you'll be encouraged by it as well.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.880]   That's up next time.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.240]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:20.880]   [END]
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   1
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.720]   Timothy 1.15, APJ 1905.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   1.15, APJ 1905.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   1.15, APJ 1905.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   Your support means a lot to us. In part, because it helps us out a lot.
