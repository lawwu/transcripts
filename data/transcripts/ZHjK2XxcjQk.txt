[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   All right, there we go.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.920]   Let's see here.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.920]   That's two questions.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   We're on to number three.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.600]   All right, sir, what do we got for number three?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.280]   Okay, next question.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.400]   We have a question about New Year's resolutions.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   I know it's a couple months past then, but he's got some good points here and he talks
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.120]   about going back to his guiding documents.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.000]   So be interested to hear what you think about that.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.480]   Hey, Cal, this is Matt.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.720]   I'm a private wealth advisor in Texas.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.640]   Really enjoy the podcast.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.560]   I'm on your fourth book right now.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.560]   And I have a question.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.800]   Given that it's the start of a new year, how would you recommend to someone who is, let's
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.120]   just say, relatively new to time block planning and to some of your ideas, how would you recommend
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.000]   they go about tackling New Year's resolutions in conjunction with coming up with the guiding
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   document for their personal life and also for their professional lives?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.640]   And then how they would then work through goals related to the four or five Cs, then
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.760]   distill those down into quarterly plans.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.360]   And then how frequently should one be checking these kind of overarching guiding documents
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.520]   and annual plans so that they can feel like they are staying true to these overarching
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.360]   principles and goals, but being able to action them on a quarterly basis and then down into
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360]   a weekly basis?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   Thanks so much.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   I really appreciate it.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.880]   So Matt, I'm going to try to simplify some of what you're talking about here.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   And so maybe that'll help.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.800]   I'm going to reduce the number of documents.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320]   I'm gonna try to reduce friction here a little bit.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   So at the core of all of this is my multi-scale time management strategy.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.180]   And again, for people who are new to my strategy, watch the time management core ideas video
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.180]   on my YouTube channel.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.440]   So that's youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.920]   Go to the core ideas playlist, play the video on time management, and I get into this in
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   detail.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.400]   But when I'm talking about my time management system, there's this one part where I say
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.520]   you should be doing multi-scale planning, which is daily, weekly, quarterly planning.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.300]   So let's start with that.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.000]   So each day, your time block plan your day.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560]   When you build that time block plan, you're referencing your weekly plan that you write
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760]   at the front of each week, which helps you figure out what you should be doing that day.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080]   When you write that weekly plan each week, you are checking out your quarterly plan,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.960]   which is aiming you towards your bigger picture initiatives or any types of habits or heuristics
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.800]   or strategies that you're running during that quarter.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.320]   And then you update that quarterly plan every quarter.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.040]   I'm going to suggest that these different planning documents you're talking about that
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.760]   exist above this scale, these annual plans, these guiding documents that for the most
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   part for now, Matt, integrate them into your quarterly plan.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400]   So you can have a quarterly plan for your work and a quarterly plan for your life outside
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.240]   of work, just have at the top of the plan.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   And if you're using something like Google Docs or some such, put it in like a box frame,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.520]   like a one cell table to differentiate it.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.880]   I think visual matters.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.440]   And you have this sort of bigger picture plan right there at the top of your quarterly plan
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   documents.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.520]   So you know what, you see it just every quarter when you work on your quarterly plan, you
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.320]   see that annual plan, like what you're working on that year, what's important to you.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.220]   And when you build your plan for that quarter, it's based on that.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.600]   And then you just see it and you don't have to worry about it's not a separate document.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.860]   So when it comes to something like New Year's resolutions, that's just going to go into
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.320]   naturally those bigger picture plans, that bigger picture annual picture.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.820]   So you're just going to see that every single week when you build your weekly plan.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.140]   And then when you update your quarterly plan every quarter, you might seriously rejigger
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.220]   that annual plan.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.940]   That's how I would suggest to simplify things, Matt.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.860]   So you just have those quarterly planning documents that influence weekly, influence
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.940]   daily, that's much simpler.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.540]   And that's the way I largely describe it in that time management video.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.060]   The one guiding document though, that you probably do want to keep separate is a values
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.380]   document is a much more timeless.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.860]   These are the values by which I run my life.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.480]   I like to have that as a separate document.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.980]   And I would suggest you review that every week.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.660]   So when you do your weekly plan, I just think it should be more precious.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.220]   And if you want to print it and put it in like a laminated folder type thing, so you
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.700]   have a physical copy you can take out and look at.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.380]   I think that's not a bad idea.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.380]   And that's just good.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.900]   I do it on Fridays at the end of the week.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.100]   Just remind yourself what you're all about.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.760]   I think that's important and that's important to be in its own document, but annual plans,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.060]   any type of guiding plans that persist on a scale beyond the quarter, throw them at
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.220]   the top of the quarterly plan.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.140]   Yes, they're not going to change much from quarter to quarter, but you're going to see
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.620]   them a lot and it's going to sear in.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.620]   So that's what I'd recommend.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.620]   And so your new year's resolutions just exist in that ecosystem.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.620]   It's nothing special.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.200]   You don't have to do something special for it.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.340]   It's just a tweak to your annual plan, gets reflected in the quarterly plans, gets reflected
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.440]   in your weekly plans, gets reflected in your time block plans, gets reflected in what you're
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.380]   doing right now in this very moment.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.900]   It all links together.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.380]   [MUSIC]
