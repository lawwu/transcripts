[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, the world says we need self-confidence more than anything else.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Well, no, there are things more important to our lives than self-confidence.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So what are those things?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John answered this question in a sermon back in 2009,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   in a clip suggested to us from Hannah in Canton, Ohio.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   It's a good one.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   This is Pastor John back in 2009 preaching on humility.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   How important is humility?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Listen to John Calvin.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   This is an amazing quote.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I want to read this quote from Calvin.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   He's really quoting two of his heroes.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So you don't hear Calvin's voice directly, you hear theirs,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but he's quoting it because he agrees with them.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   "I have always been exceedingly delighted with the words of Christusom."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   "The foundation of our philosophy is humility."
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   "And more with the words of Augustine, 'As the orator, when asked,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   "What is the first precept in eloquence?" answered, "Delivery."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   "What is the second? Delivery."
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   "What is the third? Delivery."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   "So if you ask me in regard to the precepts of the Christian religion,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "I will answer, 'First, second, and third, humility.'"
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Now my question to that quote is,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   why does John Calvin, Augustine, Christusom say,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   "First, second, and third, humility"?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Like first maybe, but then a few other things.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Why do they keep laying it like, "Fourth, fifth, sixth"?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think they could say that, and here's the reason, I think.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   The reason is because humility is the soil
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   in which everything good in the Christian life grows.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And if that soil goes away, everything good withers.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's unique in that regard.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Let me give you some illustrations.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Four, faith.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Would anyone depend on Christ as a needy, weak, and sinful person
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   if God hadn't given them humility?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Second, worship.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Would anyone earnestly make much of the worth of God
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   instead of craving to be made much of himself
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   if God hadn't given them humility?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Third, obedience.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Would anyone surrender his autonomy
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and submit obediently to the absolute authority of Scripture
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   if God hadn't given them humility?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Fourth, love.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Would anyone seek the good of others at cost to himself
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   if God hadn't created in his heart humility?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And on and on and on we could go.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So it's first, humility; second, humility; third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   because under everything, everything good that we want to flourish and grow
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   in the Christian life or in the church grows in this soil.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And where this soil is ruined, things wither.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I want to just give you a taste.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   This is sort of personal, I suppose.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I could choose so many examples.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I want to give you a taste of what the humble life feels like as we close
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   with three objections that the world would raise, perhaps.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I know that from time to time these have been raised,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   whether people you know would raise them, I don't know,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   but they give me a chance to illumine what the humble life looks like.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Objection number one,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   humility makes a person gloomy, dismal, downcast, unhappy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   My answer, no.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Gospel humility frees you from the need to pose, calculate, posture,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   sniff out what others think so that you're free to laugh at what is really funny
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   with the biggest belly laugh imaginable that makes your face contort
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and look ridiculous.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I grew up in a home, and I am so thankful.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Both my parents served with Jesus.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I sat at the table.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   My grandmother sat here.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   My sister sat over there.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Mommy sat there.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Daddy sat there.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   That's what I called them until the day they died.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And Daddy would come home with his jokes from his evangelistic crusades.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   We would hear stories of triumph of the grace with tears running down his eyes
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   of how an alcoholic was converted on the last night of the meeting.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And mingled in there, he would tell me jokes that he heard,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and my father laughed hardest at his own jokes than anybody else did,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and it worked to draw you in with amazing effectiveness.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I remember sitting at dinner tables with my father here.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   He was portly.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He always described himself as toothpicks and a watermelon.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And so when he laughed, it was like Santa Claus.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And my mother at the other end would begin with a loud soprano, "Hah!"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And then it would just break over, and both of them would have tears running
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   on their face, uncontrollably laughing.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And my sister and I were drawn into this glory.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   There weren't any humbler moments in the world
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   because they had totally lost control.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   No calculations whatsoever, "How am I being perceived?"
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   This is a freedom that can only come to the humble.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Proud people don't get red in the face and fall off their chairs
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   with contortions of laughter.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They go, "Haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha, haha."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "I'm totally in control here. I'm in control here."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Because they will maintain their dignity.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Well, when the father saw the son coming,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   he pulled up his ropes between his legs, and he ran.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   An old man ran.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I disagree with the objection that being humble makes you gloomy.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I think it frees you to be the happiest person you could possibly be.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Number two, second objection, humility makes you fearful and timid.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   No, the world thinks that because the best source of courage
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   that they can think of is self-confidence.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's the only source of courage they can think of.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   If you destroy my self-confidence by telling me I'm a sinner,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm weak, I'm dependent,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   you cut my ability to be bold and courageous and aggressive and strong.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   It's because they can't imagine another source of courage.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   There is a better source.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   God-confidence.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Not self-confidence, God-confidence.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You want to be strong and bold?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Be nothing and have God on your side.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And I don't agree with the objection
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that the only or best source of boldness is self-confidence.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   This is Isaiah 51, 12.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   This is God talking.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   "I am He who comforts you."
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and have forgotten the Lord your Maker?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Isn't that amazing, friends?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Who do you think you are to be afraid?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   When we're afraid, we don't usually expect accusations of pride.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Who do you think you are to fear man
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and have forgotten the Lord your Maker?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Man, if I am on your side, just humble yourself.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm looking at you.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I look to people that tremble at my word.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   When I look to you, they die if necessary.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Or they get converted if necessary.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   No.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Taking away pride and self-preoccupation,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   self-confidence and self-exaltation,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   taking all that away does not take courage away.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Not if you replace it with God,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   His promises, His grace.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Finally, number three.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Objection three.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Humility makes you passive
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and removes the driving motor of achievement.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   In America, the most achieving nation on the planet,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   you spread this message of humility, lowliness,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   dependence, meekness.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   You're going to ruin this economy.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   No.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   The world thinks that because for them,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   the driving motor of achievement is feeding the ego with accomplishments.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   That's what it feels like.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I'm going to take that away.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   What have I got left?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I'm feeding my ego by achieving something.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I'm going to climb this ladder.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I'm going to make this bundle.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I'm going to buy that house.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I'm going to have that retirement.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I'm going to drive that car.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm going to wear that ring.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And people will know, I made it.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You take that away.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   What are you going to put in its place?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I mean, that's driving the motor of this economy.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   What you take that away, what are you going to put in its place?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   First Corinthians 1510, "By the grace of God,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I am what I am, and I worked harder than any of them.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Nevertheless, it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and I worked."
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   This is the Apostle Paul talking.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   "While he had breath, he labored."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   "I worked harder than any of them."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "He stayed up till who knows what hour, making a tent,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   so that he wouldn't have to charge his churches."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   "I worked harder than any of them. Nevertheless, it was not I,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   but grace that was with me."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "The power of God's grace in the heart of the humble believer
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   who depends utterly on God produces incredible industry."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Say it again.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "The grace of God, the power of His grace in the heart of a humble believer
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   who depends utterly on God produces in Him incredible energy and industry."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Amen.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   That clip was taken from Pastor John's 2009 sermon on Mark 10, 32-45,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   titled "Greatness, Humility, Servanthood."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It came to us from Hannah in Canton, Ohio.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "This clip has been so precious to me," she writes,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   "in understanding and experiencing the great joy and freedom of humility.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It brings me to tears of joy each time I listen to this clip.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Praise God for this message. I am so thankful for you, Pastor John."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Amen.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Thank you for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   All of our sermon clips are now crowdsourced.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   like Hannah did today.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If you have one, email me.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and how it impacted you.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   This is an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Well, we are in the middle of the five days of Holy Week,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and Friday we return to look forward to Easter Sunday,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   the resurrection of Christ and how it has changed us already.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It's a really important topic.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   We will see you on Friday.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Thanks for listening.
