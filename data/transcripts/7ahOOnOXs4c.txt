[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Would you agree that smoking is causally related to lung cancer?
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520]   Yes.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.800]   So just to be clear, Andrew, you do not think that it's just an association that smokers
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.120]   get more lung cancer?
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.840]   No, I do not.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.040]   You, in other words, you believe that smoking causes lung cancer then?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.040]   Yes.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040]   Okay.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.200]   I mean, there are a number of mechanistic steps in between.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.460]   I mean, if somebody was really wanting to drill into the logic, they could say, okay,
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.600]   it's not actually the smoking, it's a, you know, some disruption of the endothelial cell
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   lining that, you know...
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240]   But smoking triggers that, that triggers that.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   I assume so.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   And I agree with you, by the way.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   I think the data are very clear.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   I'm very relieved to hear that.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.840]   But I'm going someplace very important here, because if there's one topic that doesn't
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.420]   get enough attention in medicine, it's causality.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.960]   And causality is an obsession of mine.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.760]   Like most of the day on some level, I sit around thinking about causality.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.720]   And I think the hardest part about studying medicine with respect to human beings is how
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.660]   difficult it is to infer causality for most things that we do.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:30.060]   So if you believe that smoking is causally related to lung cancer, then smoking cessation
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.620]   reduces the probability of lung cancer.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.480]   That is a logical equivalency.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.900]   There can be no debate about that.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.500]   What if I said to you, Andrew, this is going to be our new philosophy around smoking cessation.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.460]   I'm going to anoint you the czar of smoking cessation.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.580]   So if people pick up smoking, no problem.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.300]   We're going to let them smoke.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.460]   But we're going to assess their risk for lung cancer using a model that predicts when their
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.080]   10-year risk of lung cancer gets above a certain level, we're going to recommend that they
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.620]   stop smoking.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.980]   So we're going to look at their age, their sex, their family history, some biomarkers
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980]   that might help us.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.880]   We're going to even do scans of their lungs.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.060]   And once we think they cross a threshold where their risk of lung cancer is high enough,
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.020]   let's just say it's 25%, boom.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020]   You make them stop.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.780]   You tell them it's time to stop.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.500]   Is that a logical approach to treating smoking and lung cancer?
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.300]   Or would it be better to say, given that we know cigarettes are causally related to this,
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.260]   how about you never start smoking, and the minute you do, we pull the cigarette out of
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.060]   your mouth and explain to you that you're doing something that is causally related?
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.020]   Of course, it would be the latter, not the former.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.660]   It would be idiotic to suggest that we endorse smoking until you cross a certain threshold.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.900]   Well, this now becomes the germane question.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.020]   There is no ambiguity that ApoB is causally related to atherosclerosis.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.780]   You know, how can I tell you that?
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.580]   I can tell you that looking at all of the clinical trial literature, all of the epidemiologic
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.340]   literature, and perhaps even most importantly, the Mendelian randomizations.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.940]   All of these things tell us...
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.940]   Because by the way...
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.340]   Mendelian randomizations meaning genetic mutants, humans out there that make very little ApoB
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.340]   or excessive ApoB.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   And very much, exactly.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.340]   So we have the whole gradient.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.140]   So you can say if you make very little, you aren't going to die as quickly in your life
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.420]   as if you make too much.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.420]   That's right.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.340]   So the Mendelian randomization is such an elegant tool where you basically let genes
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.340]   do the randomization.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.300]   And as you said, there is a gradation of LDL concentration or ApoB concentration that occurs
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.780]   from insanely low to insanely high.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.220]   And this is a wildly polygenic, polymorphic set of conditions.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.900]   And we can look at the outcomes of those people based on the random sorting of those genes
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.380]   and there's no ambiguity.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.340]   LDL is causally related, LDL cholesterol or ApoB, causally related to atherosclerosis.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.220]   Well, if that's true, and I haven't seen a credible argument that it's not...
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.940]   There are people who argue that it's not, by the way, but they just don't have credibility
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.260]   in their arguments.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.740]   Then you have to say that what we're doing in medicine today is very backwards.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.980]   Because what we're doing in medicine today is the following.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.660]   We're saying, I'm coming at this in a long way, but your question is so important that
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.140]   I want to answer it this way.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.460]   We're answering your question today as follows.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.260]   We're saying, "Andrew, let's do a 10-year risk calculation of your risk of MACE."
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.220]   MACE stands for Major Adverse Cardiac Event.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.180]   It is the metric we use in medicine.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.740]   So a Major Adverse Cardiac Event is a heart attack, stroke, or death basically resulting
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.020]   from these things.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.340]   And we have calculators that are pretty good at predicting your 10-year event risk.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.980]   They'll look at your cholesterol levels, your blood pressure, they'll ask if you smoke,
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.180]   they'll ask some family history questions, and they'll spit out a number.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.380]   Now we should do yours after the fact.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.740]   And I don't know, if we did it for a person who's as, you know, you're in your mid-40s,
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.980]   like it would probably spit out less than 5% risk for a Major Adverse Cardiac Event
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.980]   in the next 10 years.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.800]   In fact, the models don't even work if age is below 40.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.980]   So the first time I went to do one of these tests when I was in my mid-30s, I couldn't
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.140]   do it.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.140]   The algorithm breaks.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.860]   That's sort of like, you know, just doesn't work.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:01.660]   So the implication there is if your MACE risk is less than 5%, the thinking is you do not
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.180]   need to treat LDL or ApoB.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.800]   I argue that that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.020]   It's just as idiotic as the analogy I used around smoking.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.420]   If a risk is causal and it is modifiable, it should be modified regardless of the risk
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.340]   tail in duration.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.180]   So then the question becomes, to what level?
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.020]   And again, the earlier you start, the less aggressive you need to be, the less damage
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.340]   that's there already.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.580]   So for example, we do CT angiograms on our patients.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.100]   If the CT angiogram shows no evidence of calcification, no evidence of soft plaque, that means grossly
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   their coronary arteries are still normal.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.340]   Histologically, they're probably not because nobody probably makes it to our age with histologically
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.060]   perfect coronary arteries.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.180]   You know, we might be satisfied with a person's ApoB being at the fifth percentile of the
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.660]   population, which would be about 60 milligrams per deciliter.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.380]   But if we have any other factors, meaning we're starting later in life, you know, or
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.100]   a person already has gross evidence of disease, calcification, soft plaque, family history
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.740]   is significant, any other risk factors are present, I mean, we'll treat ApoB to 30 to
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.460]   40 milligrams per deciliter, which is, you know, probably the first percentile.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.420]   And if somebody's sitting up in the, say, low 130s, where does that, what kind of flag
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.420]   does that raise for you?
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.740]   And I realize it's highly contextual, age, et cetera.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.740]   No, no.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.140]   It's a huge red flag.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.700]   Again, just because something is causal doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get it.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.500]   There are smokers who don't get lung cancer.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.820]   So, you know, there's going to be somebody listening to this who says, "My grandmother
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.420]   is 95 years old, she's, her cholesterol is sky high and she's alive and well."
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.740]   And I will say, "Absolutely.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.760]   There are a lot of people walking around that way."
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.900]   Just as there are a lot of smokers walking around who don't get lung cancer.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.700]   You can't, you can't impute these things on an individual basis.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.380]   You basically have to ask the question, "How do I make the best judgment about an individual
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:18.420]   from heterogeneous population data and based on what are causal and non-causal inferences
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.180]   around risk?"
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:27.500]   [Music]
