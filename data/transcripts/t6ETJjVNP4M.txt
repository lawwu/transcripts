[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   Let's bring him out.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.800]   Jimmy Donaldson, Mr. Beast.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.740]   What's up, brother?
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.240]   How's it going?
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.240]   What's up, everybody?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   [MUSIC - "I'M GOING HOME"]
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.600]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.840]   Rain Man, David Sack--
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.800]   I'm going home.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.520]   And it said--
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.480]   just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.280]   Love you, Wesley.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.760]   Ice Queen of Quinoa.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.240]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   So--
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.040]   Look at the phone.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.800]   Wow.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   Wow.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.840]   Guys, no selfies.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.440]   No selfies.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.520]   I mean, everybody's sending it to their kids as we speak.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.160]   Do your fans have like a name, like Beasties or something?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   No.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.660]   Beasties?
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.160]   Besties?
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.660]   Besties?
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.400]   Besties?
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.760]   That's Taylor Swift.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.200]   Beasties is pretty good.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480]   So I think everybody, all of you guys know Jimmy.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.080]   But let me just tell you the quick story.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.640]   I hate when people describe me in front of me, but go for it.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.720]   Jimmy started YouTubing when he was 13 years old.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840]   And this is an incredible example.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.400]   I mean, Jimmy's basically an athlete.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.480]   So if you take a guy who basically spends
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.440]   10,000 hours at something, and there's a Steph Curry outcome,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.960]   there's a LeBron James outcome, and there's a Jimmy Donaldson
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.460]   outcome.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.120]   So what does this one look like?
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.240]   He starts posting videos online.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   He starts iterating, iterating, iterating at 16.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   I think he had like--
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.320]   I don't know, 2016 or so, he had like 30,000 followers,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.600]   some nominal number.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.280]   Kept tweaking, putting in the thousands and thousands
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.880]   of hours, stumbled into college for two weeks, stumbled out.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   And then fast forward now a decade since he started this,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600]   he's basically the most followed human on Earth
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   after Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.280]   Although in terms of content creation,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   he's basically the top two or three most followed people
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200]   on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok--
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840]   sorry, not Twitter.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.340]   X.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.320]   X. Billions of views, event-based viewing.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   So when he launches videos noon Eastern time on Saturdays
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.520]   every two weeks, if you're not watching them,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120]   probably people you know, definitely your kids,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.920]   their friends, it's just a spectacle.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   And so that's how you've become you.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.600]   So let's start at the beginning.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.440]   How did your mom react?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.720]   Because Sue seems like--
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.080]   and she works for Jimmy.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.800]   She's like a head of compliance.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.440]   She just makes sure no one steals money.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.680]   It's a nice fun role.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   So what happened when you showed up and you're like, hey, mom,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.880]   I've been streaming secretly and I have these followers?
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   Well, you know what's interesting, actually,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.640]   is you should encourage your kids to have hobbies
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.680]   and want to do these things.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.600]   My mom thought it was crazy that I was talking
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.680]   to people on the internet.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   So I ended up just lying, like, oh, it was a joke.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   I just have a friend I'm talking to every night online
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   or on Skype or whatever.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.120]   And then once I hit 10,000 subscribers, I told her,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   yeah, I was a lie.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.080]   I don't have any friends.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.200]   I'm just making videos.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.640]   And she just didn't understand it.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   She was just like, what does this mean?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.320]   Where did the idea for all these spectacles originate from?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   The first few that really broke through,
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.000]   how did you guys come up with them
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.320]   or how did you come up with them?
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.600]   Well, the thing is, for people, if you
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.120]   want to get hypothetically 100 million views on a video,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   the easiest way is to do something cool no one's
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.920]   done before.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.360]   And one of the first ones was I saw
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.000]   no one had ever counted 100,000 in a row.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   So I was like, I'll just count 100,000.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   I watched that video for about five minutes.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.480]   It's pretty great.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   It's more than normal.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.640]   It's 40 hours long, but the retention's two minutes.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.200]   And you look like-- how old were you at that?
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.520]   You computed on that video by the way.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.240]   15 years old or something?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.280]   I was like 18, yeah.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.360]   It's hilarious.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.800]   So I just started because I didn't have money.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.240]   So I just started with--
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.520]   How many views does that have?
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.240]   I think that one's like 30 million.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.040]   Just me counting.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.320]   But it's funny because it's like, look at this idiot.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.240]   He counted to 100,000.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.000]   How much money has it made?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.480]   That one?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.600]   I don't know.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.120]   Ballpark.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   What do you think?
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.400]   I mean, most videos probably have like $5 RPM, so $150,000.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.040]   OK.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.200]   Great.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   OK, so you launched this thing and then it starts to go.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.120]   And then how do you scale the ideas?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   Because it does become a bit of a hamster wheel.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.920]   Like, how do I one-up myself?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.640]   Do you always feel this pressure to have to one-up yourself
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.520]   from the last video, literally?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.720]   Well, essentially, obviously, I've just
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.960]   been doing this for 14 years.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.680]   And also, you said 10,000 hours.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.800]   I think people should change that saying to 10,000 days.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.880]   And I'm almost at my halfway point to 10,000 days.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   I think that's how people should start looking at things.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.480]   Because to be honest, 10,000 hours is pretty easy.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.040]   What is that?
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.200]   10 hours a day for three years?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.000]   Just a random thing.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.040]   But yeah, just-- I don't know.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.640]   We would get 100,000 views on a video, take the money,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.520]   do another video, get 150,000.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   And I've just reinvested the money for 14 years.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.760]   And even to this day, whatever I make,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.520]   I just spend it the next month on content.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.120]   And the videos have just progressively
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.440]   gotten bigger and bigger.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.480]   And it's gone from me counting to 100,000
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.760]   to seeing what happens if you put a Lamborghini
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.040]   on the world's largest shredder.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.000]   Just random things.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Well, you also seem to have some pretty good judgment, where
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.240]   maybe some of your contemporaries don't.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.480]   We've seen that need to get the next view
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   lead to people doing increasingly dangerous stunts,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   like taking a Model X over some hill.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   I think Dobrik did that.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.440]   Some other person was swinging somebody on a crane.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.760]   Maybe you could talk a little bit about restraint
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.320]   and understanding, like, hey, even though this
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.480]   is going to get a lot of views, and maybe some
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   of your contemporaries--
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.960]   I won't give the specific names of people--
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   but they've done some really idiotic things
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.600]   and gotten hurt.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   So how do you know when a conversation and some
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   of these ideas maybe go over the line?
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   Well, the obvious answer is common sense.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.920]   Great, OK.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   Next question.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   No, no, no.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.040]   The thing is, obviously, there's a lot of things
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.480]   people do that they know will get views because of outrage,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   and it's just easy to do.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.760]   But if you're trying to build a long-term brand,
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.560]   you don't want to just constantly piss people off
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.520]   just to get attention.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.760]   Eventually, it stops working.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.200]   So the real answer is you just got to not go,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.080]   what is the easiest way to get views?
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.560]   What do people actually want to watch
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.640]   that isn't just going to get views because they're
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400]   just going to be watching it, essentially.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.900]   Got it.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.800]   You have a-- if you--
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   in Greenville, North Carolina, you basically
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   have your own college campus.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.440]   It's like buildings, lots, studios,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.000]   all these young people dynamically running around,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.560]   doing all this stuff.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640]   When I saw it, I was like, this is a tech startup.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.880]   It felt like Facebook circa 2006,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   except it's in Greenville.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.560]   Why did you think you could pull this off there?
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   Yeah, well, the thing is, as you scale up,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   you're not really--
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.120]   especially when you're in your young 20s,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.280]   you're just doing whatever you got
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.520]   to do to keep up with growing and making the videos.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.360]   So you just kind of blink, and 10 goes to 20 employees,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.640]   to 50, to 100.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   How do you get people to go there?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.320]   What is it that you're giving them
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.960]   where they would leave New York or LA
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.280]   and whatever their job is to try to do this with you?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.440]   Yeah, that's the hard part.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.000]   I'm still trying to figure it out.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.480]   Most people-- it's a lot of convincing, to be honest.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160]   I would highly recommend you don't
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.400]   build a company in the middle of nowhere,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   woods in North Carolina City like ours.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.120]   Most people don't want to live there.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.640]   So usually, it's just people who--
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.440]   their job is kind of their life, and they're
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.900]   very passionate about what they do.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.640]   So it's like, we provide you a cool job,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.480]   where one day you're going to bury me alive,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.560]   the next you're going to figure out how to send me
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.000]   to space or whatever.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.120]   But the real answer is you just got
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.800]   to find people where work is their life,
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.760]   and so they don't care.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.440]   But anyone who does, they hate it.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.640]   Well, that's actually a feature in some ways, right?
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.320]   Which is how Silicon Valley used to work, by the way.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.080]   This is what I was going to say.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.320]   How do you recruit for that?
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.840]   And what do you do when you find out
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.080]   that there are people that want work-life balance
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.440]   and don't want to do the level--
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.000]   aren't willing to commit the way you're willing to commit?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.880]   I mean, like I said, that's the part
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.400]   I'm still trying to figure out, to be 100% honest.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.040]   I think at some point, I just got
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.280]   to move out of the middle of nowhere in North Carolina.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.040]   Don't recommend it, building a big company in a small city.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.560]   How many employees do you have now?
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.960]   There are around 250.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.480]   So you consider maybe moving it to Los Angeles or something
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.120]   to be closer to Hollywood?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.560]   No, but just somewhere where it's
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.960]   like a decent-sized city would probably be more optimal.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.600]   One that has an airport would be nice.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.560]   Sure.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.360]   One of the things you say a lot is
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.760]   I'm still trying to figure it out.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.680]   I think that's the key to your success.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.280]   Having spoken to you a bunch, I get the sense
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.760]   that you're on this kind of insatiable journey.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   I mean, you speak in a very grandiose way
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   about what you're trying to do.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.120]   There's no frigging limit.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.760]   You see it in your videos, but you also
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.920]   see it in how you've iterated.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.680]   I tell people there's no one else on Earth,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.160]   no entrepreneur in history, where
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.720]   you can go track them longitudinally
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.480]   from the first thing they did all the way through to today.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.880]   If you want to understand this entrepreneur,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.720]   it's all in the open.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.320]   Go check it out.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.960]   And now you'll see the grind, and you'll
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.560]   see what it took to get here.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.480]   And it doesn't stop.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.120]   Every week, you've got some new record-breaking 24-hour video
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.280]   coming out, and it's fucking nuts.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.720]   What's the mission?
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.640]   Where's it all going?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.040]   And help just frame for the audience, for everyone,
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.840]   how do you think about where you're going?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.120]   The beauty is there's-- well, YouTube,
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   that's my main platform.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.360]   Obviously, if you buy an Android phone, YouTube's pre-installed,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   and Alphabet owns it.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.040]   So when you search things on Google,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.700]   it takes you to YouTube a lot of times.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.280]   So YouTube is just massive.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.440]   I mean, billions of people use it on a monthly basis.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.200]   And so being big on YouTube, we get 100 million views
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.600]   on a video in the first seven days, which
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.240]   up before the last couple of years,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.840]   that's never been possible in history.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.400]   So it's definitely a very interesting time
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.080]   where you can get just unfiltered access
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.840]   to basically unlimited people.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.080]   And then we just--
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   weirdly enough, it's not why I got into it,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.260]   but it ended up just working out that way,
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.360]   that I spent 14 years of my life just studying
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.800]   how to make the most optimal videos, what type of content
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.840]   people want, and we just kind of mastered
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   the art of going viral.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.100]   And YouTube just so happens to be such a big platform.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.520]   And so it's pretty nice, because now, like they've been saying,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.360]   we're getting around a billion views a month.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.400]   And yeah, we can just--
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.760]   Where do you want to take it?
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.640]   Well, recently, we started getting into selling--
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.440]   Long term, yeah.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.440]   Well, we started getting into selling some CPG products.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.960]   So we started with chocolate.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.800]   And it's nice, because the same people who I would take
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.160]   pictures with in Walmart, when they see our product there,
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.800]   they're like, oh, it's the guy from YouTube, and they'll buy it.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.560]   And so just kind of--
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.960]   right now, just anything in retail
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.240]   is great, because you just put things on a shelf,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.920]   and people buy it.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:35.160]   And it's much easier than doing something complicated.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.000]   I tell people, it's almost as if you think
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.400]   your job is to make people happy.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.760]   Is that a good way to frame--
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.440]   Yeah, of course.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   --your job?
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.220]   The other thing that I find just extraordinary
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.000]   about your business is you're essentially built Walmart
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.400]   without any of the cost structure.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.720]   Any brand you decide to build will immediately
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   have the first 10 million customers.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.400]   Yeah, well, the beauty is we don't have--
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.040]   essentially, don't have to do marketing.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   Zero marketing costs, but also zero distribution costs.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.000]   That can go one of two ways, with the Mr. Beast Burger--
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.080]   --you learned a lot of lessons there.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.280]   Maybe went too fast.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.920]   You didn't expect it to be so popular,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   and you lost control of that.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.760]   And then with the Feastables stuff, you nailed it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.160]   So maybe you could tell us the lessons from each of those
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   projects.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.760]   Well, yeah, the beauty of Feastables is--
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.520]   I mean, kind of like I said, you just put it on a shelf,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.880]   and people go there and buy it.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.200]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.240]   I mean, you want to ask me something more specific?
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.200]   No, but be honest.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.000]   Mr. Beast Burger--
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.520]   Be honest about-- hold on.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.760]   Be honest about the insane amount of product development
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.800]   work you personally do, and how deeply you
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.280]   care about making it work.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.560]   I think that's what's missing for a lot of people.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.640]   Well, no, and then my point was, Mr. Beast Burger,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.080]   you kind of loaned your name to it,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.280]   and it didn't have the same quality control.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.120]   That one I can't talk about, but--
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.620]   Oh, OK.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.120]   No problem.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.480]   I was wondering.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.000]   No problem.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.520]   Yeah, well--
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.920]   OK, let's just admit those last few questions were shitty.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.440]   Let's reset.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   No, I think it's a great question.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.600]   You just can't talk about it.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.320]   Let's bring it back to the--
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.160]   We've got a lawsuit going on.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.120]   All right, let's go back to the two smarter people here.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.620]   OK.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.360]   David, you have a question?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.600]   I want to ask about--
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.560]   I better get onto a new topic here real quick.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.720]   The thing I've been really blown away by
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.440]   is just how elaborate your productions are.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.720]   I mean, some of these videos are incredibly
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.680]   elaborate in the production values and in the storytelling.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.280]   The one that comes to mind for me
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.880]   is the Squid Game series, which, I mean,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.680]   that looked monumental logistically to pull off,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.120]   and in terms of set design and every other way.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.720]   I mean, I guess tell us more about what goes into that.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.560]   And what I'm kind of hearing from you with the 250 people
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.800]   you have working, you've built this whole town,
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.240]   it sounds like the old studio system,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.760]   like back in Hollywood, like Warner Brothers back
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.320]   in the 1930s, where they had their own lots,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.960]   their own actors, their own everything.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.600]   And it was very different back then.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.720]   Like we heard Gwyneth saying that most of her time
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.560]   in the process is like waiting around.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.800]   It doesn't sound like that's what's going on with you.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.160]   So you're back to kind of the original studio system.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.120]   I mean, like I said, the beauty is
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.680]   we don't have a studio that tells us
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.640]   what we can or can't do, or the distribution or anything.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.680]   It's just we own it all.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.960]   So we just make whatever videos we think will be viral.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.560]   And obviously, we have the direct connection.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.800]   And so the big thing is, like, obviously, YouTube,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.120]   at the moment, you don't make that much from ad revenue.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.440]   So to do these big multimillion dollar videos,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.600]   it's just not really possible, which
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.160]   is why doing things like Feastables
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.440]   and other products that generate revenue on the back end
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.720]   is why we're able to do that and other people aren't.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.560]   Because it's like, you know, even
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.280]   if you get 100 million views on a video, the RPM's $5.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.200]   It's only $500,000.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.320]   So it's not that crazy, which is why
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.120]   people aren't able to do these big budget spectacles
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.960]   like we are, because most people don't even
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.720]   get anywhere near that kind of viewership.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   And so it's like the beauty is creating the model where
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.760]   we turn around and we use that to sell products,
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.360]   sell a couple hundred million of that a year,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.600]   and then we use that to put it back into the content.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.320]   Is there pressure to tone down, like, the consumerism
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.000]   or the giving away money?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.760]   Like, do some--
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.260]   I'm sure there's a faction of people
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.600]   that either find that offensive or they
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.160]   think it's exploitative.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.800]   How do you deal with that?
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.300]   No?
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.400]   No, not really, to be honest.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.480]   Most people think it's cool, because it's
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.760]   kind of fun to watch someone receive $10,000
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.440]   or a Lamborghini or a house.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.480]   Like, the last thing we did was I ordered pizza
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.680]   and I tipped the guy a house.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.180]   And like--
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.440]   I thought that was cool.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.680]   Not bad.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.800]   I actually ordered two pizzas, one from Domino's
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.600]   and one from Pizza Hut.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.520]   And the guy who got there first got the house.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.320]   I mean, there was--
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.560]   So the Domino's guy got it.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.640]   So I ordered Domino's.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   I think, like, no, but didn't you do something--
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.320]   it was curing blindness?
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:45.820]   Yes.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.840]   Yeah, it would help the 1,000 blind people see.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.040]   There was, like, 10 Karens who got upset,
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   and people were like--
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   But there were people, right?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.960]   Like, 10 Karens got upset, and it was like, really?
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.560]   At the end of the day, as long as I
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.200]   think what I'm doing is good and helping people, like--
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.040]   obviously, at the scale of our views,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.480]   that video got 200 million views.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.560]   Of course, some subsection is going to be mad.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.320]   It's just kind of, at that number,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.120]   it's just inevitable that people will be unhappy.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.840]   There's a piece of your business that actually many people
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.240]   probably don't know about outside the commercial part,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.480]   which is Beats Philanthropy.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.600]   Do you want to tell people about the size of the food bank
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.640]   you've built and how that works?
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.520]   Sure.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.360]   So I just-- I feel we're talking about it myself,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.560]   but we essentially just started a charity
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.880]   and then made a YouTube channel where, you know,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.400]   whatever we do with the money from the charity, we film it.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.280]   So then it generates revenue on the back end.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.000]   And obviously, those videos go on
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.600]   to raise a lot of money for donations.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.440]   And so it's just kind of a cycle where we upload a video a week,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.480]   and we were able to build a couple of food banks
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.240]   and feed a couple hundred thousand people,
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.040]   that kind of stuff.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.440]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.520]   Do you want to talk about the business model in the future?
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.960]   So you have basically this YouTube business.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.680]   And that goal is essentially just maximize growth.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.320]   Yeah, just make content people want
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.640]   and get as many views as possible.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   And as J. Cal said, build distribution and direct it
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.920]   at these old legacy companies.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.600]   Are there things-- but you said you
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.560]   wanted to do things that were just like--
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.200]   it seemed less offline, right?
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.080]   So I'm sure you looked at online things.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.880]   I mean, right now, it's just like--
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.600]   the reason we started with chocolate is, obviously,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.160]   in the last 50 years, there hasn't
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160]   been any major chocolate company that has spawned up.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.880]   Like Hershey's, Limp, Mars, Farrar,
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.240]   they're all like 100 years old.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.960]   And so it's kind of just a sleepy space
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.280]   where they don't really innovate,
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.560]   and it's kind of boring, and no one really cares.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.700]   And so obviously, eventually, we'll
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.080]   do online because it's much easier
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.540]   to get people to download an app to buy a physical product.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.040]   But it's just kind of perfect because the shelf space never
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.760]   changed, and people want something new.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.160]   And so it was easy to take over.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   How big is that business for you, can you say?
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.320]   This is our second year.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.920]   We'll do a couple hundred million.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.840]   Wow.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.340]   OK, wait.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.760]   So we just guessed about the math here.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.400]   You said a billion views a month at $5 CPM.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.320]   So it's $5 million a month for the video,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.840]   so $60 million a year.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.360]   And the chocolate bars will do $200?
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.160]   I mean, we're not really public about it,
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.440]   but it'll do a lot of revenue.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.400]   We'll figure it out.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.680]   They'll do something, more than a penny.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.080]   What do you think about the success of Prime?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.240]   How do you look at that?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.760]   Yeah, they're killing it.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440]   Yeah, that's a great case study.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   It's just--
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.280]   Because I heard you can build--
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:25.760]   You never--
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.440]   I heard you can build a million revenue, right?
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   Well, I don't know about that, or at least I
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.360]   can't say publicly.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.520]   But I can say you never would have thought
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.800]   tens of millions of kids, or at least millions of kids,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.600]   would be so enthusiastic about a sports stream.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.360]   It's crazy the kind of demand they've
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.240]   created, like kids literally collect Prime bottles,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.080]   and then TikToks go viral showing off
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.880]   their collection of drink bottles that are like $3.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.000]   Raise your hand if you've got kids that do that.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.160]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.560]   I mean, so Prime was great because obviously it's
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.480]   a beverage, and the more shelf space you get,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.560]   just naturally more sales.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.080]   But it was more a lifestyle brand
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.160]   they created where just kids felt cool drinking it,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.520]   and to the point where they would buy a 12 pack for like
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.880]   $15, and then sell them for like $6 a bottle at their school,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.080]   which is like something that happens in almost every school
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.520]   in America.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.480]   It's crazy, still to this day after like a year and a half.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.720]   One of the things that I think if you taste Prime
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.880]   that it has is a ton of sucralose, right?
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.840]   So it tastes super like bam, big mouth feel.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.040]   Where's your thinking on like the line between nutrition
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.200]   versus just tastes good for the products you have
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.760]   and the products you want to build,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.160]   and where do you want to take that?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.480]   Oh, great.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.640]   I think that's very important.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.960]   That's why our chocolate, we only use four ingredients,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.240]   whereas Hershey's uses nine.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.720]   Because obviously, since we have this much influence,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.160]   we don't want to just make people--
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.080]   whatever we sell needs to be better than what's
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.120]   currently on the shelf, or then it's just a net negative.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.880]   Better for you, higher quality ingredients, et cetera.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.480]   So yeah, I mean, in a nutshell, that's kind of how I view it.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.880]   And so what are these other areas
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.240]   and that just make maybe obvious sense
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.640]   if you could snap your fingers and just--
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   Yeah, well, I think the simplest thing--
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.360]   the more I've studied chocolate and see it,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.960]   like we started with--
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.000]   funny enough, we started selling dark chocolate,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.080]   which 65% of kids in America don't even like.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.960]   So that was kind of dumb, but I didn't know any better.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.640]   So I mean, the simplest thing is do milk chocolate, which
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.280]   is what we're getting into, and then just going down
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.800]   and maximizing chocolate, like doing Reese's Cups
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.560]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.100]   So past chocolate, I haven't really thought about it,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.000]   because that's basically all I'm thinking about for next year.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   Do you think the candy business can be a billion dollar revenue
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.720]   business?
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.560]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.920]   I mean, look at Hershey's.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.760]   What are they doing?
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.840]   $12 billion a year, Mars, tens of billions.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.240]   I mean, in America alone, I think
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.640]   people spend $25 billion a year on chocolate.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.240]   And there's no one in those companies
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.800]   building a Mr. Beast competitor.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.300]   I mean--
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.080]   From a brand perspective.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.000]   There's no one in those companies
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.720]   that build the companies.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.880]   They're like 100 years old.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   They're all dead.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.040]   But yeah.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.000]   How do you-- you must have a ton of inbound
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.160]   to do things outside of the Mr. Beast realm, Hollywood, et
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.920]   cetera.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.200]   How do you sort through all the inbound opportunities
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   and then organize?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.920]   Because you could, I would suspect,
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.720]   be drowning in opportunity at this point
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.960]   with this level of notoriety.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.120]   That's why we are where we are is because we just
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.080]   laser focus on one thing for essentially my entire life.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.520]   And so it's pretty easy.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.920]   I just say no.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.640]   Everything.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.680]   And then, yeah, because it's like, obviously,
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.400]   to make the videos of the caliber we need,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.720]   it's just like that's been my obsession for the last 14
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.520]   years, almost every waking hour of the day,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.120]   just obsessing over every little thing.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   Even simple things like when you click on a video,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.120]   the brightness in the video matters.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.720]   Like if it's a little too dark, people
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.520]   are more apt to click off and not watch it
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.920]   because not everyone has their phone screen brightness turned
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   up.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.320]   You did something with your mouth being open or closed
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   in the thumbnail and it changed click-throughs.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.360]   That was a new A/B test.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   Well, the problem is whatever I do, a bunch of other people do.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480]   And I started opening my mouth in my thumbnails.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.600]   And it's kind of annoying.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   And then a bunch of other creators did it.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.600]   And I was like, OK, we're not doing this anymore.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.640]   So I switched them back.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.880]   So everyone else will switch them back.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.640]   What's the budget on each video now?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.840]   So every two weeks, how much money goes into that video?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.040]   I think right now it's around $2.5 million per video.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.440]   That's like making an independent film
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.160]   every two weeks.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.520]   I mean, I don't think it's that crazy, though,
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.280]   because they're getting like 100 million views in seven days.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.580]   So if any other medium outside of social media
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.920]   that got that kind of viewership,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.160]   their budget would be like 50x.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.040]   Absolutely.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.400]   Do you think that you're building a library?
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.600]   Do you expect that the video that you created,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.680]   the Olympic games thing you did a few weeks ago, in five years,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.440]   that that'll still be--
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.040]   that'll have some value 15 years from now?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.080]   Well, 15, I don't know.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.800]   But five, yes.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   Usually, whenever we upload a piece of content,
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.000]   we'll get a couple million views a month for--
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   as of right now, forever.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.400]   But obviously, eventually, it'll probably die off.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.960]   But they're usually pretty evergreen.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.720]   Because right now, because we have the model where
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.600]   we're making money outside of YouTube so I can spend more,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.400]   it's like you have this video that's $2.5 million budget,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.880]   or another video that's $2,500 budget.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   And so right now, usually people end up
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.480]   just clicking on the cooler stuff.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.920]   And then how do you think about just the axis of going
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.000]   outside the United States?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.840]   So different languages, different countries,
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.560]   how do you deal with that?
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   That's the best part.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.120]   So as you know, we hired voice actors
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.720]   to dub our videos in every language.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   And I assume a lot of you guys here are content creators.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.920]   And the crazy part is only 10% of the world speaks English.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.720]   So if your content's only in English,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.760]   it's pretty hard to obviously reach most of the world,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.520]   even subtitles.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.200]   Most people don't prefer it.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.920]   So if you dub your videos, hire voice actors or whatever,
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.320]   your viewership will skyrocket.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.720]   And so right now, over half the people that watch my videos
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.800]   don't even speak English, which is pretty crazy.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.120]   Tell me about the relationship with YouTube
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.760]   and how that's evolved over the years.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.320]   Because I don't know they anticipated
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.280]   that the footprint of the top creators on YouTube
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.120]   would get so large.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.280]   Are they deeply involved in communicating with you?
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.200]   Or are they just like, hey, we're a platform.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.480]   Post a video if you like it.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.760]   It's that.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.600]   That's extraordinary to me.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.520]   I mean, I kind of like it because then no one
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.560]   can say there's favoritism or they're helping us in any way.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.840]   But agreed, even when I was coming up,
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.680]   people were getting 10 million views a video.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.480]   And that was mind-blowing.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.080]   And their lifecycle would be like a year, and they'd fall off.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.320]   So it's kind of crazy.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.480]   I don't really know how we ended up getting this big.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.040]   Was there ever a thought to tell them,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.200]   I need to make a higher minimum per RPM,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.320]   and I'd like to cut a deal with you to hit these numbers
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.440]   and be treated differently?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.760]   They'd be like, well, then everyone's going to want that.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.280]   Because if they do it with me, then they
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.360]   would open the floodgates.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.920]   They would just tell me, spend less money.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.420]   Got it.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:37.920]   Interesting.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.120]   Because no one's forcing me to spend this much money.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.000]   It's kind of the problem.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.040]   Technically, most people don't spend hardly any money.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.640]   But there was a moment in time where
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.320]   Microsoft started stealing away some YouTubers and folks
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.840]   for their Twitch competitor.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.400]   Did you get those kind of offers?
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.880]   And then how did you evaluate them?
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.200]   Well, the problem is, like I said at the start,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.720]   YouTube's where all the viewers are.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.000]   So it's like, sure, you can get a little bit of money.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.620]   But ultimately, the real game is if you
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.640]   can get a billion views a month for 10 years,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.320]   whatever, the amount of brands we could build is insane.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.120]   It is the great success of YouTube
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.880]   that they've hit this level of scale.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.400]   Exactly.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.960]   And the features and stuff on that,
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.160]   YouTube is the only platform right now
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.320]   where you can upload a video in different languages.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.440]   So if someone clicks my video in Mexico, I'll speak Spanish.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.720]   Whereas if you click it in America, I'll speak English.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.800]   That feature is in beta right now.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.880]   Yeah, well, they've rolled it out to other people.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.080]   On TikTok, Facebook, no other platform can you do that.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.840]   So YouTube's the only place right now where you can
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.200]   actually have a global audience.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.960]   Do you provide the voiceover person,
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.560]   or is that done automatically?
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.800]   Because they're working on an automatic version, I was told.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.600]   For the first or the next two years,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.480]   it'll probably sound terrible.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.920]   But of course, at some time in the near future,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.360]   AI dubbing will--
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.760]   We get hit up about that all the time for the all-important
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:47.960]   things.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.320]   Right now, I've trained a ton of different voice models.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.480]   They all sound terrible.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.680]   But it is obviously getting better very quickly.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.240]   Have you published any to see what the viewership looks like?
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.680]   Yeah, AIME versus real voice actors?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.160]   We have.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.240]   And it's usually-- so if it's a one-minute video,
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.680]   and the retention with normal voice actors is 45 seconds,
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.400]   it'll be like 42.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.080]   But it'll also be a lot of comments like,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.360]   why does he sound slightly off?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.600]   So the retention isn't as bad as you would think,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   but it's still like--
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.560]   You can tell the quality score's lower.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.400]   The thing is, when you're using dubs,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.520]   you're already at a disadvantage.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   Because they can choose to watch someone
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.280]   in their native language or watch you
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.240]   with a guy speaking over your lips.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.160]   And so if it's not as good as--
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.040]   you're already down here a little bit worse.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.840]   And then if you use AI dubbing, it's even worse.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.280]   I think video games are six times the revenue for movies
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   today.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   Have you thought about video games?
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.280]   I've got to assume folks have approached you.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.640]   And how do you think about the video game industry?
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.520]   Because you have a lot of audience overlap,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.360]   I've got to imagine.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.040]   To be honest, I tried to build one.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.800]   And then six months in, I was like, oh,
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   these things take years.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   And then I was like, I'd rather sell chocolate.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.240]   So yeah, that was kind of the extent of it.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.780]   I mean, obviously, it's a no-brainer.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.080]   Because it's much easier just to tell people to download it.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.360]   Just click the link in the description and download it.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.720]   But I've just found that--
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.360]   I don't know.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.760]   I just keep going back to it.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.080]   Making confectionery products is just so much more fun.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.640]   And 100 million people are walking to Walmart every month.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.360]   And if you don't have a product there,
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   there's nothing for them to buy.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   And so I just want to maximize that,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.000]   getting something in every retailer in America first.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.920]   One of the things that you've done
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.640]   is you've mentored younger content creators coming up.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.260]   Who are people that you look at that
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.420]   are creating things that you think are interesting,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.860]   whether it's formats or--
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.340]   I'm curious.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.420]   How many of you guys make content out there?
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.900]   Like, anything?
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.660]   OK.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.580]   I mean, we do.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.220]   A little bit.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:37.720]   I guess so.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.900]   Actually, do you have--
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.940]   I guess we're podcasters.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.980]   --tips for us?
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.700]   I mean, our viewership on YouTube
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.180]   is embarrassingly small compared to--
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.540]   One of the things he did first was
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.420]   he ripped apart our thumbnails.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:48.920]   Oh, yeah?
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.540]   He said our thumbnails were total shit.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.180]   I mean, that's--
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.680]   Remember?
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.900]   And we gave that to Nick.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.780]   Was I joking?
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.420]   Or was I being serious?
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.160]   No, you were telling us.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.360]   I think you guys, like--
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.580]   I mean, clearly, it's working.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.220]   I think that no one cares about your guys' thumbnails.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.380]   I think the big thing is the value you guys provide
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.700]   and that it's a--
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.740]   Should we not close our mouths now in thumbnails?
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.380]   Oh, you should.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.060]   Are the mouths open?
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.900]   Yeah, the mouths are open.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.820]   I would close them.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.380]   I mean, there's something different about--
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:10.900]   James, another--
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.940]   --each week of--
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.260]   Especially for this age group, definitely close them.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.760]   Well, no.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.460]   I mean, there's--
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:15.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.140]   No one wants to see a shock--
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.380]   There's something distinctly different about what you do.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.260]   Every week, it's something new.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.700]   It's something original.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.180]   We're trying to have a conversation, McLaughlin group--
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.680]   Of course.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.420]   --kind of format.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.740]   So I think some of those tips don't work.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.420]   But our audience on YouTube, I think,
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.360]   now will exceed what we're doing in podcasting, ultimately.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.700]   Because it does seem that people like to watch us and put it
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700]   on in the background.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.580]   So we're seeing that.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.620]   I think we have 380,000.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.380]   You guys are doing great.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.020]   To be honest, I remember when you first started it.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.060]   And I was like, oh, this is an interesting combo.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:48.740]   But it works.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.460]   And whenever something weird in the world happens,
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.760]   I'm like, oh, I'm going to go see what they think of it.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.580]   It's cool.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   Where do you see this--
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.540]   We met Jimmy at poker, by the way.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.540]   Do you think we could--
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.860]   No, where do you think this is going to be in 20 years?
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.940]   What, your podcast?
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.440]   You.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.220]   No, I mean, we have an idea where this is going.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.300]   I don't know where this would be in 20 days, I'll tell you.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.020]   Actually, to be honest, the only thing in front of us right now
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.500]   are The Daily from The New York Times,
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.380]   A Priest Reading the Bible, and Serial Killer Podcast.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.620]   Serial Killer Podcast.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.380]   I mean, it's really not much ahead of us.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.740]   All our podcasts are in news.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.780]   All podcasting, those are the three ahead of us.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.100]   And just to build on J-Kal's question,
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.660]   do you feel pressure to elongate the content?
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.300]   Or you feel like you've optimized now the amount of time
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.900]   where you maximize viewership?
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.660]   Well, yeah.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.780]   I mean, that's actually something we've
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.080]   been focused on a lot recently.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.780]   I think the problem is people are like, we waited two weeks,
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.380]   and it was just 15 minutes of content.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.580]   And they actually get annoyed when it's too short.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.220]   So we're working on elongating it,
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   but not because of algorithms or anything.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.020]   It's just like people just actually
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.660]   don't like waiting two weeks for just 15 minutes of content.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.220]   They want more or more frequent videos.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.500]   And the problem is the spectacles are so big,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.420]   it's much easier just to make it longer than do a whole new one
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.580]   to upload more.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.860]   So yeah, they're naturally getting longer and longer
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.360]   right now.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.460]   I wonder if you did a behind the scenes on the off week
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.660]   and just had another group.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.460]   Because I was watching the one you did where
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.420]   you were all on a raft.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:17.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.460]   And you decided to torture your team.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.540]   We spent seven days on a raft in the ocean.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.460]   I mean, it was torture.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.800]   I mean, it was painful to watch.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.340]   But a behind the scenes of that done
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.740]   by another group of video editors on the off week,
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.180]   I bet you would do as many views.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.180]   The thing is, though, the mystery is part of what's cool.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.420]   How does this random YouTuber give a million dollars
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.460]   away to someone on the street or things like that?
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.860]   So part of it is them not knowing how it's even possible
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.460]   is why it's so interesting.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.660]   And they click on it, if that makes sense.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.220]   Can you talk a little bit about the point of view
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.700]   where folks say content creators on YouTube have an audience.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.900]   And that audience ages out.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.060]   And then they lose that audience.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.780]   And how you've continued to be able to grow your audience.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.300]   Well, everything is--
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.060]   Even though some of the folks you started with
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.780]   have gotten older.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:04.420]   The problem is there's no one size fits all advice.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.900]   And so obviously, if we're talking to someone who
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.860]   unboxes toys, their audience is going to grow.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.860]   And there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.500]   But for us, ideally, one day you guys
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.420]   aren't going to be like, oh, my kid loves you.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.660]   You'll be like, I also like your content.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.020]   But we try to make content that no matter what age you are,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.700]   you'll enjoy it.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.660]   So usually they don't--
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.660]   Who here personally watches Beast?
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.700]   Oh.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.420]   More than I would have thought.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:28.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.180]   Us too.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:29.780]   Appreciate it.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.180]   All right, everybody.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:31.860]   Jimmy Donaldson.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.700]   And the timer says 25 seconds.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.420]   Oh, we went over.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.220]   We went over.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.060]   We gave you an extra.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:36.700]   Over 25 seconds.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.060]   Well, you can stay up here if you want.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.980]   We're going to take questions from the audience.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.700]   I'll take a question from the audience.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.820]   I flew out here for this.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.700]   Let's do some more.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:43.940]   OK.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.360]   I'm going to moderate the question.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.500]   Raise your hand.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.380]   How do you stay consistent with executing so frequently?
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.460]   I think that's the hardest thing for entrepreneurs.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:53.780]   I'll repeat.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.340]   I'm going to repeat.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:54.780]   I can.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.420]   I'll repeat it.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.540]   So he asked, how do you stay so consistent with what?
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.500]   With your execution.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.980]   With your incredible execution.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.980]   It's so hard.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.660]   You have to spot on all the time.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.860]   He said, how do you be so consistent with execution,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.900]   spot on all the time?
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.620]   So the thing is, you just have to obviously just train
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.300]   great people.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.100]   Because if you're doing everything yourself,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.980]   eventually you're going to burn out, get different interests,
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.700]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   And so I actually-- my top people, I bought a house,
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.620]   and we all lived together for years.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.100]   I just kind of trained them to think like me and see
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.820]   the world like me.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.420]   And so my top probably 12 people, 95% of the time,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.860]   if you ask them something and ask me in different rooms,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.220]   we'll give the exact same answer.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.420]   And the other 5% of the time will just
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.580]   be very slightly different.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.260]   Have you thrown away a video because you
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.260]   were unsatisfied with it?
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:40.780]   Oh, of course.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.500]   All the time.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.540]   That happens all the time.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.180]   So out of 10 videos, how many would be--
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.940]   Well, the thing is, if you want to build viewership
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.980]   over time, if you want to go from 10 million to 20 million
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.460]   views a video to 30 million views a video,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.860]   you just have to get it where every time they show up,
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.580]   they're happy.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.260]   They feel like they got value out of it.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.340]   It's like it was worth their time and investment.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.740]   So yeah, if something's not good and they click on it,
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.540]   then they're less likely to click on future videos.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.460]   To grow viewership like that, it has to be--
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.540]   Want to take a second one?
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.180]   Yeah, take one.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.540]   Right here.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.500]   When I hear you talk, you're amazing.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.460]   You're very uptight.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.460]   And you've obviously accomplished a lot.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.460]   I'm just curious, how do you keep your--
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.940]   how do you keep your ego?
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.460]   So here's a talk you developed with a guy
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   you can back it up to.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.460]   And it's pretty great.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.460]   And it's very casual.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.460]   Thank you.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.940]   And it's all building to our business.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.940]   So how do you--
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.460]   Here, you repeat the question.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.940]   I don't know how to repeat that one.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.140]   Not as easy as it looks, huh?
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.140]   That's how he does it.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.380]   He would like to know how you're a normal person
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.660]   and you stay so authentic given this incredible--
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.460]   Keep your humility.
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   Yeah, how do you keep your humility?
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.060]   And stay humble, yeah.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.260]   Well, I think the beauty of it is I usually
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.940]   spend 99% of my time in my studio.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:45.940]   So I don't really--
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   Like, the 100 million number on the video
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   just looks like pixels on a screen.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.460]   Like, I don't really experience it that much.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.460]   So I think that's kind of the best part.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.460]   How do you walk through an airport these days
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.460]   or walk, you know, through a city?
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   It is pretty crazy, huh?
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.460]   I was really worried about getting you here.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.460]   I kept asking them, how are we going to get him
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.460]   through LAX?
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.460]   I don't understand how this is going to happen.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460]   Well, that's--
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.460]   The thing is you throw a hood on and wear some glasses.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.460]   And you're pretty good.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.460]   And you just don't talk out loud or anything like that.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.460]   So--
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.460]   Same thing.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.460]   All right, everybody, give it up for Jimmy Donaldson.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   Thank you.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.460]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   That was fun.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.460]   That was awesome.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.460]   [MUSIC - JIMMY DONALDSON, "I'M GOING ALL IN"]
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.460]   I'm going all in.
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.460]   Let your winter slide.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.460]   Rain man David Sasson.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.460]   I'm going all in.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.460]   And it said--
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.460]   We open sourced it to the fans.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.460]   And they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   Love you, Wesley.
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.460]   I'm the queen of Kinwan.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   I'm going all in.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   Let your winter slide.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.460]   Rain man David Sasson.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.460]   Besties are gone.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.460]   That's my dog taking a noise in your driveway.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.460]   Oh, man.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.460]   Oh, man.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.460]   My athetaster will meet me at place.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.460]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.460]   because they're all just useless.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   It's like this sexual tension that we just
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   need to release somehow.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.460]   Let the beat.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.460]   Let your beat.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.460]   Let your beat.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.460]   Beat.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.460]   That's going to be good.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.460]   We need to get merch.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460]   Besties are back.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.460]   I'm going all in.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:20.500]   I'm going all in.
