[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.260]   Pastor John, in the last podcast episode, in episode 214, you addressed recent allegations
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.160]   claiming that while you are open to prophecy in tongues today, you don't seem necessarily
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.880]   convinced enough to advocate that others pursue these gifts themselves.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.920]   You corrected that, and you said that there are very good exegetical reasons for your
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920]   confidence.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.320]   Explain those reasons for us here.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   Right.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   What I said was, in 1 Corinthians 14, 39, it says, "Earnestly desire to prophesy, and
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.400]   do not forbid speaking in tongues."
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.360]   And I said, "I think that is a command that we should still obey today, and that I try
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:56.840]   to, and my way of understanding prophecy is not as infallible, Scripture-level, authoritative
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.720]   speaking," which is, I think, the way John MacArthur would take it and other folks.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.880]   I take it as something that God spontaneously brings to mind in the moment, and because
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.640]   we are fallible in the way we perceive it, and the way we think about it, and the way
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.120]   we speak it, it does not carry that same level of infallible, Scripture-level authority.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.920]   And here are some reasons for why I think that's true, and why I think it's still
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.440]   valid today.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.600]   1 Thessalonians 5, 19, "Do not quench the Spirit, do not despise prophecies, but test
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920]   all things, hold fast to what is good."
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.280]   Now that text is different from 1 John 4, 1, where it says, "Test the spirits to see
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world."
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.800]   There, you test a person to see if he's a false prophet, and you hold fast to the true
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   one.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.280]   Here, you test words or prophecies, and you hold fast to the ones that are good.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.040]   Test all things, and hold fast to what is good.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.400]   You're not choosing between people here, it seems to me, you're choosing between what
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.880]   they say, which you would not do if they spoke with infallible, inerrant, Scripture-quality
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.280]   authority.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.240]   The issue here is that some in the church are despising, not the prophets, but the prophecies.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.960]   Now why would that be, I ask?
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.160]   And my answer is probably because they are sometimes wacko.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.280]   Despise is a very strong word.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.800]   Paul says, "Don't despise."
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.840]   So somebody in the church at Thessalonica is saying, "Look, you told us that prophecy
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   is a gift from God.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.200]   Frankly, we're not liking what we're hearing because it's stupid, it's weird.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   They're saying things that are off the wall, and so they're tending to despise them."
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.760]   And Paul seems to be trying to keep the people from throwing the baby of true prophecies
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   out with the bathwater of weird ones.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.400]   So that's my first observation from 1 Thessalonians 5, 19-21.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.480]   Here's the second one.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.580]   Every man who prays or prophesies—this is 1 Corinthians 11, 4—every man who prays
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.440]   or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, and every wife or woman who prays
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.280]   or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.720]   Now, I don't see how women prophesying in the assembly fits with an infallible scripture-level
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.000]   authority when Paul forbids that kind of authority to be exercised over men by women in the church
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.840]   in 1 Timothy 2, 12.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   Instead, the picture here seems much more spontaneous and mutual, as is described in
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.600]   1 Corinthians 14, 3.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.080]   The one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, their encouragement, their
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   consolation.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.640]   Now that would just make sense if God brought to the mind of a woman, say, in a gathering,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.960]   a small group gathering, something she felt would be incredibly helpful to somebody, as
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   long as she does it in a way that is culturally appropriate, that she's not undermining the
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.680]   authority of the men—I think that's what the head stuff is all about—then she's free
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.200]   to do that.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.840]   This is what men and women do in smaller worship settings, and the gift of prophecy would be
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.600]   when God does that, when he brings something to mind with an extraordinary timeliness or
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.400]   suitableness, and exerts the power for upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   So the fact that women are encouraged to do this, and yet women are told not to exercise
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.520]   authority over men, says to me, we've got something else going on here besides what
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.760]   others say are Scripture-level authority.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.240]   And here's a third one, just the last one.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.540]   And there are others, but "Love never ends," this is 1 Corinthians 13, "as for prophecies,
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.320]   they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.400]   away.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.840]   For now we know in part, and we prophesy in part," that's a very crucial statement, "we
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:44.160]   prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes," as though the prophecies were not that, "when
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.760]   When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   child; when I became a man, I put away childish things.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.560]   Now we see in a mirror dimly.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   Then face to face, now I know in part, then I'll know fully, even as I have been fully
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   known."
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.620]   Now what's he talking about there?
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.580]   The future in view here, I think, is manifestly when Christ comes.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.520]   When the perfect comes, in the time of adulthood, when he's not speaking like a child anymore,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:24.760]   the time of seeing face to face, not in a mirror anymore, but rather knowing fully,
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.440]   even as I have been fully known.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.740]   That's not any time in this age.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.560]   That's the end of the age, when we will know fully, even as we have been fully known.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.040]   So that's when the gift of prophecy stops.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.080]   So this text is a pretty clear argument, I think, that the gift of prophecy in tongues
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.800]   will continue until Jesus comes back.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.400]   It seems to me that the reason they pass away, it says, is precisely because they're imperfect.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.800]   They're not scripture-level authority, because verse 9 says, "ekmerus prophetuomen."
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   That's the Greek.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.320]   "We prophesy ekmerus."
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:14.780]   We prophesy in part, just like a little child trying to reason and think and talk.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.120]   And when he grows up and becomes a man in the age to come, he won't need that kind of
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   help anymore.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.060]   So those are three reasons that I would say that the gift of prophecy is here until Jesus
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:36.040]   comes, and that it doesn't mean the kind of scripture-level, inerrant, infallible, authoritative
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.240]   speech that some take it to mean.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   Yes, excellent.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   Well said.
