[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   We don't want to presume any answers here on Ask Pastor John, and Tracy, who's a
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.400]   white woman, writes in to ask, "Pastor John, I would like to know if dating or
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.960]   marrying a black man is wrong. If so, could you please tell me where to look
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.080]   in the Bible for it? I know a lot of people frown upon this, but I want to be
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.480]   sure what God says and not what man says." I preached on this, I've written on it in
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.560]   bloodlines, I got a whole chapter on interracial marriage, and here's the
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.320]   summary of my argument. There are two basic restrictions on marriage in the
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   Bible. Number one, she should marry a man. Number two, he should be a Christian. And
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.040]   I get that from 1st Corinthians 739. If her husband dies, talking about a widow,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.320]   she is free to be married to whom—this is a masculine pronoun here—to whomever
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:07.280]   she wishes, only in the Lord. So Paul is very vigilant that you don't go out and
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   marry an unbeliever. So this is just huge, that we should only marry people who
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.280]   love Jesus. He didn't restrict it in any other way. People have brought up to me
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.320]   over the years the restrictions that God put on Israel for intermarrying with the
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.680]   nations, and used that as an argument for being opposed to interracial marriage,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.720]   and my answer to that is, those stipulations in the Old Testament were
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   religiously motivated, not racially motivated. In other words, Solomon's
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.760]   foreign wives took his heart away from God, and that was the issue, not that his
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   his ethnicity would be corrupted by them. The Old Testament simply doesn't
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.120]   argue that way. It is very concerned, just like Paul is, with marrying in the
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.640]   faith. Another issue. When Christ came into the world, he created a new
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.240]   Israel, a new ethnic group, as it were, made up of every other ethnic group. You
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.560]   are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.160]   possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.640]   of darkness into light, once you were not a people. And the "you" he's talking about
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   is Jew and Gentile, every ethnicity, but now you are God's people. Marry in your
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   tribe, namely the tribe Christian, across any ethnic or racial lines, but marry in
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.200]   the tribe of this new tribe that Jesus is the head of. You have received mercy,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.520]   and so you're a new people, and that's the qualification. Here
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.060]   there is no Greek, no Jew, no circumcised, no uncircumcised, no barbarian, no
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.160]   Scythian, no slave, no free. Christ is all, and in all. Go ahead, marry across all the
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.680]   lines inside that new humanity. And my last vivid argument, maybe, that I
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.760]   should refer to is Moses married a Cushite, and everybody agrees that the
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.560]   Cushites are black Africans. They're from down the Nile River, and we know it
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.120]   caused problems because Miriam, his sister, and Aaron got very angry about
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.280]   this and confronted him in Numbers 12 verse 1, "Because of the Cushite woman
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.240]   whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman," the text says, and they got
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.080]   angry, and in that anger, as they opposed Moses, God showed his colors, and he was
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   really upset, so that he gave to Miriam a leprous hand, and she pulls her hand, and
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   she's leprous. And the Bible, I think, and I could be wrong about this, maybe
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.720]   pushing it too far, it points out her hand was white as snow, white as snow.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.600]   This is verse 10 of Numbers 12. Is God saying to Miriam, "Look, if you're
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.760]   so concerned about Moses' wife being too dark, I'll give you something really
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.720]   light. Here's snow called leprosy on your hand." I think this is a picture of God's
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.240]   indignation that Moses would be confronted, not as to whether or not the
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.960]   Cushite was a believer, but whether she was the right color or the right
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.840]   ethnicity for the man. And let me just close with a story. I love to tell
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   this Urbana story. Noel and I were at Urbana in 1967, and a great missions leader was on a
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.080]   panel, and somebody asked him from the audience, they had microphones
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.200]   in those days, "Aren't you concerned in going to Pakistan for so long that your
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.680]   daughter's gonna grow up there, fall in love with a Pakistani, and marry a
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.400]   Pakistani?" That's what he asked from the floor. And this answer, I've never
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.800]   forgotten it. It had a huge effect on me in those days. I was 20 years old at the
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.920]   time, and he said, 21, and he said, "Better a believing Pakistani farmer than a rich
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.840]   unbelieving American banker." And it just sank into me that, yes, that's
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.320]   exactly the right answer. Of course it matters who she marries. She must marry a
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.440]   Christ lover, a Christ follower, and if it's a Pakistani, praise God, but don't
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.080]   marry a rich white American banker, because he's not a believer, and that's
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   gonna make for an impossible biblical marriage. So every marriage is a
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.800]   cross-cultural marriage. Every marriage is hard. Get ready for stress no matter
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.760]   who you marry, but that's what the gospel is for. That's what we're supposed to
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.920]   understand. So don't marry—I'll say this to women right now—don't marry a
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.640]   marginally Christian man. Some women want to be married enough that they're willing
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.760]   to settle for this man he's just squeaking by. He says he's a Christian. I
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.680]   don't think he could provide any spiritual leadership at all. I don't even
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.400]   know if he's solid, but he just says the right words. I just want to encourage
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   women, pray that God would lead to a man whom you can trust as a deeply
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.840]   Christian man, and same thing of course goes for men.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, and for more on interracial marriage, see Pastor John's
