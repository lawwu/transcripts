[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   How do you think people could be,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.280]   or do you think people should be more themselves,
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.480]   and how do they do that?
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.760]   - Well, it's just, I found out that,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120]   you know how there's some, there's like a,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.480]   there's a sixth sense for humans.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.120]   We can sense.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.960]   We can sense when somebody's being authentic,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.440]   and we can sense when somebody's not being authentic.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   Right?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.040]   And I think,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.080]   I think you just wanna make sure
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.440]   everybody around you knows that you're authentic.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.120]   Because people just love authenticity.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.960]   This is why you guys voted for Trump.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.720]   Not to get political, but at least you can probably think
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.640]   that whatever Trump says, he actually believes.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.880]   Whether you like it or not, right?
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.000]   But the authenticity is so attractive about humans,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.200]   and I think it's just like such an underrated feature
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   that many people don't seem to grasp,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.160]   is the more authentic you look,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.280]   which means the more you say what you really wanna say,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.400]   it means you'll actually be loved.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.280]   It's very counterintuitive.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.320]   It's very counterintuitive.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280]   Because everybody is living in this act.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.600]   We're all acting.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   You're smiling when you're supposed to smile.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.720]   You're shaking hands when you're supposed to shake hands.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840]   You're putting a tie when you're supposed to wear a tie.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.280]   We're all acting to each other until we die.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.320]   But at some point you have to stop acting,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.040]   and just like be who you really are.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.200]   You know, I once went to this conference in Switzerland.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.000]   I'm not gonna say the name of the conference.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But man, it was the most boring thing I've seen in my life.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.280]   Where everybody pretended to be interested
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.880]   in everything everybody else was saying,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680]   but I know for a fact, for a fact,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.080]   that deep down inside, everybody was bored.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.400]   But during the conversations, they were like,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, great point, great point.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.600]   "Well, I really love your suit."
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   It was such an act that made me realize this is not it.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.280]   This is not it.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.120]   - Do you think people do that
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.200]   because they're afraid to be authentic?
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   Not because they're afraid of who they are,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.080]   but because they're afraid other people will judge them?
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.320]   - Yeah, I mean, you don't wanna rock the boat.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   I mean, if you're making millions of dollars in Switzerland,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.840]   you don't wanna rock the boat.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   I mean, I'll be the nicest guy ever
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   if I have a million dollars guaranteed out of it, right?
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.920]   So I think there's too much to lose.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.280]   And that's why you have to be nice to each other.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   But when there's nothing to lose,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.920]   then you become who you really are.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.000]   And you see it when there is war.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.320]   Oh, I have nothing to lose now.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   I'll just go be myself.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440]   I can go loot, I can do whatever I want.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.800]   But when you have a lot to lose,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.480]   like that's why rich people's circles,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.080]   everybody's so nice to each other.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.840]   Because one mistake, you lose millions of dollars.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.640]   So I think maybe the reason why we're nice
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.200]   is 'cause we're scared of losing
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.840]   what we have already achieved.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120]   And I see it myself.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.280]   When I have something to lose,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.440]   I'm actually a little bit nicer to others.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.880]   I'm a little bit less myself.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.920]   Now I've come to a point where if I lose everything,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.880]   I still have some money in the bank, so I'm okay.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760]   And that's why I think you see Elon Musk
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.880]   to be so himself, so crazy.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.480]   Because he has nothing to lose.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600]   He has the world's money.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.560]   That's it.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.400]   What's the worst thing?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.360]   He's never gonna be homeless.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   So in a way, if your livelihood is on the line
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000]   with what you're about to say,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   you're gonna say the nicest thing ever.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   - It's interesting, I talked to the,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.920]   I don't know if you know Bill Perkins.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.440]   He wrote a book called "Die With Zero."
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.000]   And as an experiment-- - "Die With Zero."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.840]   - "Die With Zero."
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   As an experiment, he decided to go get
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   some really old clothes and go panhandle for a few days
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.880]   in, I can't remember what city he was in.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.160]   And what he did was he realized,
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.600]   wow, if I just sit on the street and beg for money,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.720]   I can make, I actually think it was a crazy amount of money.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.280]   It was like $50,000 a year.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.120]   - Wow.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   - And he was like, oh, so I'll never be homeless.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.040]   Like, I don't have anything to worry about.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.440]   Like, if everything gets taken away,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   I can go live on however much money
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.080]   I can make begging on the street.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.680]   And it mentally got rid of that.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.640]   I'm curious, most people listening here
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.480]   are not at the kind of wealth that they're,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.720]   getting millions of dollars in conferences in Switzerland.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.200]   But they're kind of in this middle ground
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.680]   where they're probably not being their authentic self.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.600]   You've talked about having the courage to be disliked.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.040]   And I think a lot of times in a conversation,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.480]   someone's not willing to say something
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.080]   'cause they're like, ooh, maybe someone won't like it.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.800]   Oh, maybe I'll offend someone.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.240]   Even though I really feel it.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.480]   And I don't think that means
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.920]   intentionally trying to offend people.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.480]   What would you tell someone who's like,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.800]   hey, Nassir, how do I just be more me?
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   - I think people should aim to be disliked.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.200]   And this is really counterintuitive.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.720]   Again, very counterintuitive, very.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.800]   You should aim to be disliked.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.520]   Because the way I've seen the world work is
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.960]   for every one person that dislikes you,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.520]   there's an equivalent person
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.560]   on the other side of the world that loves you.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600]   And so the more somebody dislikes you,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.000]   the more another person loves you.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120]   So it's a very polarizing thing, right?
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.240]   But if somebody doesn't dislike you,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.600]   you know what it also means?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.240]   Nobody actually loves you.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.680]   So, and this is why most politicians in democracies
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.600]   end up with like 50-50%.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.760]   Now, why is that?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   Because politicians need security and everything
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.360]   because there are people who really dislike them
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.240]   and wanna kill them.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.640]   That's why they need security.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.440]   And there are people who really love them
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.440]   and wanna vote for them forever.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   And so, I think people should aim to live life
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.320]   like a politician, which is have some people
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.720]   that clearly dislike the way you live life,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   but also on the other side, you'll have your people.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   And people are just attracted to big ideas, big opinions.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.240]   They're attracted to people who are authentic.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   And you know, I hate Gary Vee, okay?
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.240]   Just to be very open about it.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.600]   Like, I'm not a fan.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   I'm not a fan of the Gary Vee style,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.240]   but he's a genius for doing it
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.280]   because that same style is why he has a diehard fandom.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.240]   And that's powerful.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.160]   And I'm trying to emulate Gary Vee
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.200]   as much as I hate his style.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.440]   I'm trying to emulate it by being who I am
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.760]   and get my fair share of haters.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   I think I have 30 million haters or so.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.680]   But on the other side, I have 60, 70 million lovers.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.760]   I love living like that.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.160]   - And does it make you happy?
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.360]   - Very happy.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.840]   That's probably the only thing that makes me happy
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   is knowing how much I'm worth hating.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.240]   Because it also means I'm worth loving by somebody else.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.440]   It's because there's something to hate.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.640]   I mean, like anybody who lives life without being hated on
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.320]   is not somebody who's done any meaningful change.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.440]   Most change comes with resistance.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.920]   And if you are not getting resistance for your ideas
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.360]   and what you believe in and what you like
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.080]   and what you wanna do in your career,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   then you're not pushing the envelope enough.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.240]   And if you're not pushing the envelope enough,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.200]   your life is inconsequential.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.440]   That's how I think about it.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.680]   Of course, these are very extreme thoughts.
