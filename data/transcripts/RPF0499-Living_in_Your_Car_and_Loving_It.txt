[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.480]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.360]   the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.640]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.160]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.680]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.400]   My name is Joshua and I am your host,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.680]   and today we're gonna talk about living in your car
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.400]   and loving it.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.160]   Car living is interesting to me
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.560]   because it's one of those things that we often talk about,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.240]   but we often talk about it in a very pejorative tone,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.560]   a very kind of downright,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.440]   "I can't believe that someone so-and-so
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   is living in their car."
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.800]   Frankly, a lot of people get forced
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.140]   into living in their car.
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.680]   Over the past years,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.160]   especially right in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.440]   there were a number of articles
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.880]   about increasing communities of people
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.800]   that were living in their cars to save money,
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.160]   people that were losing their houses,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.440]   getting forced out, getting laid off, et cetera.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.360]   I noticed a big uptick in news articles on the subject,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.000]   and I haven't noticed those news articles
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.520]   continuing today in 2017,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.080]   but I have noticed a fascinating growth
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.120]   of people who are living in their cars on purpose.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.940]   There are many people who live in their vehicles on purpose,
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.960]   and with our modern democratization of communication
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.520]   where any individual can get their message out,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.480]   I've found really interesting communities of people
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.160]   who are all engaged in living in their cars,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.360]   and they're called van-dwelling communities
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.720]   'cause many people will live in their van.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.060]   Of course, there are many variations of this,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060]   and this is not an unknown thing.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.280]   After all, there are thousands of very wealthy people
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.240]   who live in their cars.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.960]   They just call their cars RVs,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580]   and they're very big and often have an expensive bus chassis
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.080]   and a big old diesel engine at the back,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.640]   but there are lots of millionaires who live in their cars,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760]   and RV is just a glorified car,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.560]   and then there are people who are flat-out broke,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680]   dirtbag rock climbers living in the back
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.400]   of their pickup truck out at the rock face
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.620]   so they can crawl up the rock face all day long.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.460]   Now, for whatever reason,
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.760]   I've always been interested in car living,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.920]   and it's something that I never did when I was younger
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880]   when I probably could have done it,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   or at least I never did it the way
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.780]   that I'm gonna describe to you now.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.640]   For a brief time in college,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.660]   I was commuting from home, and I drove a van,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.820]   and I would keep all my stuff in my van,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.920]   but I would primarily just live on my friend's dorm couches
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.160]   and things like that,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.080]   and I would go back home a couple times a week,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.240]   but I never got to the point
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.480]   where I was actually sleeping in my car,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.920]   and today I kinda regret it.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.480]   I wish that I had spent time living in my car
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.320]   when I was in college
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.640]   'cause that would've saved a lot of money,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.120]   and I get a little sick when I think about
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   how much money I spent on housing expenses
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   during a time in my life
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.480]   at which it would have been very inexpensive
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.860]   to live in my car, but whatever, water under the bridge.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.180]   What I do have extensive personal experience with
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.260]   is traveling in my car
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.720]   and living in my car while traveling.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.520]   I don't have extensive experience
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.600]   with doing it for months and months and months at a time,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.800]   but I've done it four weeks at a time,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.280]   and in that process, I've learned some lessons,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   and I thought I'd pass them along to you today
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   because, frankly, there's a big, big benefit
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.360]   for many people, especially many people
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.600]   who are in really tough living situations
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   to be able to live comfortably in their car,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.520]   and there can be major opportunity
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.080]   for you to have a breakout financially
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.800]   if you use a strategy of living in your car.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.240]   I've interviewed in past episodes
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   of Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   people who've lived in their car in college
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.440]   to save money, to graduate debt-free.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.760]   I know many people who've done it.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.280]   I've talked to many people who've done it,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.000]   and I think I have some ideas that are helpful for you,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   that could be helpful for you to consider
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   about how to do it and live well
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.760]   because, to me, the big thing is
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.200]   how to live in your car and love it is a key.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.920]   We all have a different threshold for pain.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920]   We all have a different threshold
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.640]   for things that we don't wanna do,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.040]   but I want you, if you're gonna live in your car,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.880]   I want you to love it,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.080]   so let me give you some strategies and ideas,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.840]   but first, let's talk about the value
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.440]   of why this would be helpful for you.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   In most major cities around the United States,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.000]   I think what you'll find is
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   about the cheapest you could live,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.480]   just renting a place to live on your own,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.200]   about the cheapest would be something like $500 a month.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.880]   I've seen a few places cheaper.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.480]   If you're out in a rural area
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.980]   or a very low-cost-of-living place,
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.200]   you may be able to get it lower,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.360]   but if you're gonna rent an apartment,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.040]   an efficiency apartment or some kind of room,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.680]   basically about $500 a month
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.320]   is gonna be the lowest that you can get.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.260]   Now, that, for many people, will be appropriate,
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.040]   but $500 a month still adds up quickly,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.600]   and if you compare that today,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.360]   left and right on Craigslist, right in your town,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.480]   you could buy a really good, high-quality minivan
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.520]   for about 3,000 bucks,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.040]   and if you chose to buy a good, high-quality minivan,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.260]   which I'm showing my hand here
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.800]   as to what I think is the ideal solution
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.000]   for a single person,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.900]   if you buy a $3,000 minivan,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.000]   you live in it for a year,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.820]   you could turn around and sell that thing all day long
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.440]   for $2,500.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.120]   So let's say that it costs you $500 per year
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.440]   of straight cost for living in the minivan
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.600]   versus $500 a month for rent.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.200]   There's a $5,000-plus savings there for you,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   and for somebody who is living in extreme poverty
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   or for somebody who's trying to break out
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.800]   to accumulate the investment capital
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.160]   to make a significant investment of some kind
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   or just for somebody who wants to travel
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.480]   and do something fun,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.740]   that's a big benefit there,
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.880]   and I think, especially for a short-term strategy,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.560]   I think there's a really good opportunity here.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   Now, whether you do this on the long-term
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.320]   or whether you just do this for the short-term, like I do,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.680]   I think you should consider it.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.520]   I've just returned from a week on the road.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   I went out to Texas for FinCon 2017,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.240]   and I spent a total of a week on the road,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   and I actually didn't plan,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.600]   I got behind and I didn't plan ahead in time this time.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.480]   I didn't intend to drive out there.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   I was gonna book a room at the hotel
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.200]   and I was gonna fly out, but I got behind,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.000]   and all the prices by the time I got around
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.240]   to booking my travel were just crazy expensive,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.080]   and I looked at the prices,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   I'm not gonna do that, I said, "I'll just drive."
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.680]   So I did my usual minivan traveling technique
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.280]   that I'm gonna describe for you,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.560]   and I saved quite a bit of money,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.680]   quite a bit of money by going and staying in my car
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.080]   for the last week while I was at a professional conference
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.120]   and while I did some personal travel
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   and did some other personal things along the way
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.000]   that I needed to do.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.720]   Now, why would I do that?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.700]   Could I not have paid the higher price?
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.540]   Well, yes, I could.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.200]   I have the money, I could have purchased the hotel room,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.860]   I could have purchased the air travel,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.360]   but I have a few things that I have learned
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.800]   as to why I always think carefully.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.360]   First, anytime I can save money,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   I think about the value of that savings
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.040]   and I consider what I get if I spend the money
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.560]   versus what I save if I don't spend the money,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.320]   and I always try to put a long-term time perspective on it.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.300]   So let's say that I conservatively saved,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.720]   and I saved quite a bit more,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.760]   but let's say over the last week,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   I conservatively saved $500 by avoiding hotel expenses
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.680]   and staying in my car, and I was very comfortable,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.800]   very happy about it.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.660]   I'll describe more about how and why
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.880]   to do this comfortably and love it,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.540]   how to live in your car and love it.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.000]   But if I saved $500, now, certainly $500
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.120]   would have been a business expense,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.040]   so I have a little bit of tax savings there,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.440]   but if I take $500, and let's say that I saved that $500
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.120]   today, I'm still in the wealth accumulation stage of my life
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.680]   and I haven't hit the tipping point
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.200]   at which my wealth grows so fast that I can spend
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.920]   and still grow wealthier.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   I haven't yet reached that point.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.280]   I'm working towards it, but I haven't reached that point.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   So any savings that I can make happen
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.160]   at this stage of my life winds up being very helpful.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   If I saved $500 by living in my car for the last week,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.320]   if I were to invest and successfully invest
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   that $500 over the next 40 years at 10% growth rate,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.520]   that could conceivably be worth $22,629 40 years hence.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.720]   So again, my $500 savings invested at 10%
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   over the next 40 years could wind up being worth $22,629.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.640]   Now, is that an accurate number?
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.280]   Yes, if under those circumstances,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.000]   will I wait 40 years and do this?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.620]   I don't know, but I definitely saved far more
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.760]   than $500 this last week by living in my car and loving it.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.200]   And I've done this again and again and again,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.260]   and all these little savings add up.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.000]   So big cost savings and potentially big investment return
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.200]   by me freeing up more and more investment capital
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.280]   so that I can invest aggressively at this stage of my life
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.840]   to build wealth more quickly
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.520]   and build financial freedom much more quickly.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.960]   Now, what about the downside of it?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.480]   There are downsides to living in a car,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.040]   traveling in a car, et cetera.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.560]   And I'll cover those at the end of today's show.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.680]   I'll tell you when you should not live in a van
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.140]   or even travel in a van, because I don't always do this,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.120]   but I do frequently do this
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.840]   because there are a lot of upsides to it as well.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.160]   I enjoy traveling, I enjoy traveling on the road by myself,
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.640]   I enjoy the freedom and the flexibility and the adventure.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.140]   And traveling on the road by myself allows me
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.040]   to have an adventure and to have a nice
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   tax-deductible adventure.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.660]   And I actually prefer, and I own an RV,
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.080]   I've owned other RVs in the past,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.280]   there've been many times where I've actually chosen
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.360]   not to use an RV that I've had,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.940]   but simply chosen to use a minivan.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.800]   And I think that some of the things that I'll share with you
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.000]   will be very helpful to a few of you.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.760]   The previous show that I have released here
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   on Radical Personal Finance, I did it on how to save money.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.080]   And just as a simple example,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.320]   I was with a friend of mine who has really been
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   struggling financially, a college student.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.360]   And for this college student,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   if he could maneuver himself into owning a minivan
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.680]   to live in versus renting an apartment,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.560]   it would be a major, major financial benefit for him.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.840]   It would make a huge difference in his life
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.400]   to be able to do this.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.160]   So I wanna share with you some ideas
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.040]   of how to live in your car and love it.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.800]   So let's talk first about what kind of car to live in.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.320]   Well, first you have just a standard car.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.880]   I'm just gonna say car, a standard sedan.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.560]   Now this is the worst solution in general.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.900]   So let's talk about why it's bad
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.080]   and how to make it less bad.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.420]   Many people wind up forced into their car.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.000]   They get behind on their rent, they lose their house,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.360]   and for whatever, they reach a financial crisis
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.560]   and they're kind of forced into their car.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.140]   And they got to deal with whatever it is that they have,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.720]   whatever kind of car that they have.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.760]   And frequently this is something like a sedan.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.400]   Now this for me, I'm a very large man.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.680]   So I'm six and a half feet tall,
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.760]   I weigh over 300 pounds.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.320]   So for me, this is the worst
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.360]   because there's almost no way for me to be comfortable
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.840]   in a small car the way that some people are.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.120]   Some people can curl up in the backseat of a car
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.760]   and curl their legs up and be okay.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.640]   But for me, there's almost no way to do this
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.480]   and be comfortable.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.800]   So I consider this option to be absolutely awful.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.140]   But if you find yourself living in a car,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.100]   like just a small sedan of some kind,
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.080]   there are a couple of strategies that I have used
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.340]   and that I have tried that can be useful.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.260]   Number one, check to see if the backseat of your car
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.580]   can flip down.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.220]   Frequently, if you flip the backseat of your car down flat,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.580]   you'll have a pass-through between the trunk of your car
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.860]   and the backseat.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.800]   And sometimes in a small car,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.940]   you can put your feet at the trunk
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.240]   and then you can lie in that pass-through
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.900]   with your head up towards the front seats,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.900]   lying parallel with the orientation of the car.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.900]   And that can be a way
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.300]   that you may be able to stretch out fully.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.940]   Years ago, I had an old 1993 Honda Accord.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.060]   I drove this car all over the place.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.320]   And when I graduated from college,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.740]   I took off on a, I did a 13,000 mile road trip
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.140]   over the course of a couple of months all around the US.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.020]   And in this Accord that I had,
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.660]   I didn't really have a good way to sleep in it.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.540]   And so I was primarily planning to stay with friends
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.420]   on that trip.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.100]   I didn't have the money to stay in hotels,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.260]   but I was planning to stay in with friends.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.140]   And so I had the friend option.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.300]   And then of course there was the tent option.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.160]   I think I had a tent with me,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.020]   but my backup plan was to just stay in the car.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.260]   And I had tried it out,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.380]   that I was able to flip that backseat flat
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.960]   and I was able to be,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.380]   to lie in it with my feet at the trunk
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.820]   and my body coming through that hatch
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.060]   and to be not grossly uncomfortable.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.360]   I wouldn't call it comfortable,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.700]   but it was not grossly uncomfortable.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.100]   So consider that if you're in a situation
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.100]   where you're in your car
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.420]   and it may be the kind of thing where it helps you
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.380]   if you're traveling across the country,
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.780]   you don't wanna pull into a hotel,
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.400]   you just wanna pull into a rest area,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.440]   look to see if your car can be used in that way.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.700]   Second, many sedans could be modified in a way.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.940]   And especially if you have a cheap car
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.140]   where you can just change it without too much of a pain.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.660]   You can modify it by taking out the passenger seat.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.560]   So if you remove the passenger seat from a standard sedan
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.500]   and possibly if you remove the backseat,
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.700]   you may be able to build a platform there
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.780]   that would be sufficient for you
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.420]   to be able to lie flat on that platform.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.800]   So build a sleeping platform.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.640]   And you could do this
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.820]   even if you have rudimentary carpentry skills,
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.540]   build a plywood sleeping platform
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.260]   and then put some padding, a nice thermo rest
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.980]   or other mattress type of material on top of it.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.380]   And you may be able to build a flat sleeping platform
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.260]   if you take the passenger seat out.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.380]   So that can be a way for you to do it.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.300]   Now, I think that's really not superior,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.640]   but those are two options that can make an awful situation
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.260]   of living in a standard car a little bit better.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.340]   Now, next kind of subset of a car
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.500]   is a special car called a Toyota Prius,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.780]   which I consider to be basically the perfect car
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.900]   for most people who are gonna have a car.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.880]   They're inexpensive, they're well-made,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.340]   they're very efficient with fuel, et cetera.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.940]   And I've described in previous episode
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.980]   of "Radical Personal Finance"
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.180]   how I've used a Toyota Prius to camp in comfortably
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.740]   and many other people have discovered this as well.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.820]   The basic function of a Prius, because it's a hatchback,
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.940]   you have a significant amount of vertical space
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.500]   in the very rear of the car.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.640]   And so, and interestingly also with the Toyota Prius,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.220]   you can fold the seat back of the rear seat forward
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.380]   and it makes a flat shelf on the back of the car.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.180]   And then you can fold the front seats, seat backs,
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.620]   backwards and you make basically a very long flat shelf.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.240]   And so the Prius has significant interior space
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.340]   and I've camped many nights in a Prius
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.180]   with just a small mattress pad underneath me
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.560]   and can do it very, very comfortably for one person.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.580]   I don't think, and by the way, all of my,
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.860]   most of my discussion today is for one person.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.220]   In a moment, I will talk about vans,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.580]   which are the options for two people.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.860]   The Prius is really only suitable for one person
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.380]   because of where your need to put your baggage.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.980]   And if you have two people in it,
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.900]   there's basically no place for you to put your baggage.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.540]   And the only option would be to use something
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.980]   like a rooftop box, cargo box, for you to put your baggage.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.420]   And there, that's gonna destroy your gas mileage
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.560]   significantly, I don't think it's a good plan.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   But the Prius can work really, really well
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.620]   for a single person.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.900]   Today, if I were interested in long-term travel
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.380]   and I wanted to tour the U.S. United States
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.800]   as a single person and travel all around,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.460]   I would choose a Prius.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.580]   They're inexpensive to buy.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.060]   They are very fuel efficient,
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.740]   which allows you to put on tons of miles
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.140]   at a very low cost.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.140]   And the big benefit of the Prius is,
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.140]   because it's a hybrid, you can leave it on all night long
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.060]   and run the air conditioning while you're sleeping.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.420]   You can also leave it on all night long
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.820]   and run the heater while you're sleeping.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.340]   And it'll run the air conditioning, as a true hybrid,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.740]   it'll run the air conditioning off of the battery system.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.780]   And then as you drain your high voltage battery system,
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.740]   it will automatically turn itself on
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.540]   to recharge the batteries, and then off.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.340]   And it'll cycle on and off all night,
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.260]   and it will just basically sip fuel.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.900]   You can camp in this very comfortably,
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.380]   and you can travel very inexpensively.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.460]   I've spent, I think my maximum time was two weeks
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.660]   that I spent traveling and camping in a Prius.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.620]   And it worked really, really well.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.860]   I've been so comfortable in many places.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.220]   I've parked in parking garages in a Prius
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.140]   and slept in there.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.580]   It's just been a, it's a great option.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.140]   The challenge with a Prius is,
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.340]   you still have minimal interior space.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.360]   And so you're kind of always vaguely uncomfortable
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.060]   if you're doing anything but sleeping.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.020]   And so if you can't be out of the vehicle,
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.460]   it's really hard to be in the vehicle
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.520]   and be anything except vaguely uncomfortable,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.820]   with the exception of being able to lie flat.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.000]   So the Prius is hard to live in full-time.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.100]   It's adequate for sleeping,
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.260]   but it would be hard to live in full-time.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.780]   But good for travel, just hard for living full-time.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.900]   If you're gonna travel with it,
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.260]   make sure that your style of travel
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.460]   is gonna involve your ability to be outside of the vehicle
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.780]   frequently for extended periods of time.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.540]   You're traveling where there's good weather,
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.780]   and you can just set up your chair,
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.820]   set up a table outside of the car,
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.020]   because you don't wanna,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.780]   it's too small to be able to comfortably live in.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.020]   I consider it ideal for traveling, not for living.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.120]   Next option would be a pickup truck with a camper shell.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.760]   Actually, let's do SUV next.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.960]   Next option would be an SUV.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.420]   I've camped in SUVs,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.600]   both a Ford Expedition and also a Ford Escape.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.160]   The Expedition, of course, far larger.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.280]   The benefit of the Expedition
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.720]   is that if you fold all of the three rows of seats,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.920]   you can do the same thing with Suburban.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.200]   If you fold them flat,
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.300]   you can get a pretty large flat space
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.600]   in the back of a full-size SUV.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.880]   You can do this also with a Ford Escape.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.680]   My wife and I, when we were newly married,
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.920]   we had both an Expedition and an Escape,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.200]   and we both camped together, the two of us,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.460]   in both the Expedition and the Escape.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.240]   In case you're wondering why,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.500]   what I frequently found is I like to have a tent.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.860]   A tent is nice, but there are often times
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.080]   where if you just can stay in your car,
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.060]   you can be in a place where a tent is not appropriate.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.360]   You don't have to go to a campground
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.640]   or find some kind of wooded area.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.160]   The car, by being able to be in your car,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.320]   you can be comfortable, you can be private,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   and you can sleep well in an urban environment.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.840]   That's been the type of thing that was helpful for us.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.760]   When we were newly married and saving money,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.240]   I remember one time we went to a friend's wedding
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.800]   that was in another town.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.060]   Of course, we could have spent the money
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.800]   to stay at the hotel, but we didn't have any need for that,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.280]   so we just went there.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.580]   Then on the way home, we pulled over,
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.800]   we had the mattresses in the back,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.240]   and we were able to be comfortable
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.280]   in a parking lot or rest area on the way home.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.200]   Those types of savings, when you're young
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.120]   and you're willing to be flexible,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.720]   you're willing to be adventurous,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.000]   those savings of hundreds of dollars add up.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   When you're in that wedding season of life,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.600]   those things add up and it allows you
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.200]   to put a lot more money into your investments
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.080]   if you can minimize your hotel expenditures.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.980]   We've done both the expedition and the escape.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.280]   The expedition was obviously nice
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.480]   'cause I could stretch out full length.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.720]   The escape was a little bit pinched for me,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.320]   but the escape was really nice
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.100]   because with the older original models of the escape,
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.600]   you could get that completely flat load floor.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.580]   It just wasn't quite long enough for me.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.520]   I had to make alternative provision,
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.000]   but if you're under six feet,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.160]   then a Ford Escape or similar size Mazda Tribute,
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.340]   that type of midsize SUV might work for you.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.560]   Just put the seats down in the back
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.680]   and start to play with it and figure out what looks good.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.420]   Sometimes with different SUVs,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.240]   you can remove the seat back or remove the base of the seats
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.000]   and then put the seat back flat.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.360]   Sometimes you need to build a small platform,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.200]   a small wood platform with a piece of plywood and some legs
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.440]   where the rear seat passengers feet would go.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.400]   And or sometimes you need to put,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.800]   you can fill it with bags or some other kind of material
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.240]   so that you have a longer place to lie down.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.720]   The problem with SUVs is however, again, vertical space.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.680]   You don't have much space between your platform
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.560]   and your roof because the seats aren't usually designed
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.760]   to go completely flat.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.500]   And because of the way that SUVs are constructed,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.360]   they don't have that low floor.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.540]   And so you have very little vertical space.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.680]   So again, although two people can go in an SUV
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   and because it's more comfortable than a car,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.640]   you still don't have all that much vertical space.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.600]   So hanging out inside the vehicle
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.160]   is never gonna be quite comfortable.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.440]   It's just not.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.900]   And so they're just always vaguely uncomfortable.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.640]   It's fine for temporary sleeping,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.640]   not fine for being inside.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.560]   It's kind of the same, imagine this is the same problem
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.880]   that you face with tent selection
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.080]   because we all have these same trade-offs.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   You can get a very small tent.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.240]   Let's say you have a small backpacking tent.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   Well, a small backpacking tent is wonderful.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.920]   It's lightweight, it's small.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.620]   It can be very good in extreme weather.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.880]   It's low to the ground, minimizes the wind pickup,
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.620]   the wind that hits it.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.640]   But the problem is you don't really wanna hang out
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.440]   in a two-person backpacking tent.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.840]   There's just no room to set up.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.760]   There's no room to be in it.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.040]   And so if you're stuck in the thing in a bad weather
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.920]   on a bad camping day, it's just not fun.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.480]   You can get a big old wall tent,
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.440]   like the ones they use out in the Western United States
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.280]   during elk season.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.200]   You set up these giant wall tents.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.120]   Well, they're awesome to live in,
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.640]   but now you're not gonna set one up and move every day
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.960]   if you're traveling across the country.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.400]   You face the same trade-off with vehicles.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.880]   So SUVs I consider adequate in some cases, but subpar.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.440]   Just like with about everything else about an SUV
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.500]   is they do everything in a mediocre manner.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.720]   And really, unless you need to haul a bunch of people
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.880]   and tow a heavy trailer, and you need four-wheel drive
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   and high ground clearance
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.260]   'cause you live at the top of a mountain,
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.840]   nobody should own SUVs 'cause they're worthless vehicles.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.880]   How's that for an absolute statement?
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.440]   Just teasing you, but I really think pretty much about that.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.960]   Next would be a full-size.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.920]   Let's do pickup with a camper shell.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.200]   And this is a frequent option that you see
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.440]   that can really work.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.680]   If you buy an eight-foot pickup, or if you're shorter,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.280]   you buy a shorter bed pickup,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.360]   and you put a camper shell on the back,
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.060]   you can have an inexpensive dry place,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.480]   and this can work well.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.800]   Frequently, people who do this
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.200]   will build a sleeping platform that is raised,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.320]   or sometimes they'll go ahead and just put a mattress
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.120]   right on the floor of the pickup.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.800]   You can also buy very high camper shells,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.280]   which can gain you more vertical height.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.960]   And here, there's gonna be a balance
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.580]   between how much vertical space you have
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.280]   and how comfortable you are.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.580]   One individual, single person could be very comfortable
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.700]   camping in the back of a pickup
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.720]   with a very simple topper shell.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.400]   And by camper shell, I'm not referring to a truck camper,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.800]   which is a drop-in RV that would have a kitchen
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.840]   and a dinette.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.480]   Those are good options, but I'm talking cheap here.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.640]   I'm just talking about a standard truck topper,
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.500]   fiberglass truck topper, like you see all over the place.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.240]   You can build, in the back of a pickup truck bed,
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.280]   you can build a single-width cot
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.980]   that's raised up a little bit,
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.300]   and that gives you a comfortable bed.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.920]   It gives you storage space underneath the bed.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.760]   And then, beside the bed, you can also set up
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.720]   a low platform for you to work on,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.060]   set up a mini desk or to cook on, et cetera.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.680]   So an individual, single person can be comfortable
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.920]   in a camper shell.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.620]   And because the space is so large,
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.760]   you have the benefit of being able to use large mattresses.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.040]   So a couple people can sleep comfortably
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.740]   in the back of a camper shell.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.420]   That works well, but again,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.720]   you face the problem of livability,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.460]   especially if you have a compact pickup truck
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.460]   or a relatively low-height camper shell.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.720]   And if you need the storage space under the bed,
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.960]   you start to face a problem with that livability
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.080]   'cause you don't have much vertical room.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.920]   So I think that the pickup with camper shell is workable,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.020]   but the other big problem is what do you do
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.300]   in terms of climate control?
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.860]   If you are camping in a hot area,
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.660]   then, and you're in the back with a camper shell,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.080]   you have no air conditioning.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.320]   And if you're in a cold area
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.400]   and you're back with a camper shell,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.300]   you have no built-in heating from the vehicle.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.400]   You simply have to use an external heater,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   a kerosene heater or something like that.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.220]   And with air conditioning, that's especially hard.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.980]   So I think this is an okay option, but it's not the best.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.500]   It would be the best if you are camping
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.460]   in a remote rural place
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.780]   where you need off-road capability
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.040]   and you need four-wheel drive capability.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.020]   But here, depending on your budget,
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.820]   if you're a real dirt bag and you just don't have any money,
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.300]   then you gotta go with a camper shell,
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.420]   me, I would look to buy a cheap truck topper.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.460]   Some of the, sorry, a cheap drop-in truck camper.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.780]   Some of these options with the raised roofs are really nice
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.300]   and give you substantially more living space
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.940]   with minimal costs,
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.460]   gonna be a few thousand dollars, five or six,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.820]   especially for a used one,
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.020]   and/or it's gonna be a lot more livable
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.620]   and a lot more usefulness.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.540]   One thing I have seen if you own a pickup truck
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.540]   is you can sometimes stay inside of it,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.740]   especially if you are somewhat short.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.100]   I have seen a friend of mine,
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.460]   real redneck out here in Florida,
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:33.300]   he used this idea and he took one of the folding bench seats
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.100]   from the back of a conversion van
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.180]   and he swapped out the front seat in a crew cab pickup
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.940]   with the folding bench seat.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.680]   And so that folding bench seat would fold down flat
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.500]   into a bed and he lined up that bed with the back seat
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.100]   to make a very large mattress inside of a crew cab pickup.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.580]   So that could be done if you're really into that.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.460]   I wouldn't wanna do that
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.860]   because I wouldn't wanna have a fixed bed seat,
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.500]   you'd give up all the ability to,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.660]   that wouldn't work for me, but you could do that.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.780]   And then you also will see frequently
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.660]   the over-the-road pickup truck drivers,
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.700]   especially these guys that are car haulers,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.020]   they usually will use these large trailers
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.280]   and they haul cars for car dealers,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.740]   but they'll often use a one-ton pickup truck.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.020]   Frequently you see them
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.800]   and they'll often sleep in the back seat
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.200]   and they'll make that back seat area up into a bed
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.780]   that works if you're short
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.940]   and/or sometimes you can actually buy
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.560]   a small sleeper module.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.720]   There are companies that manufacture a small sleeper module
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   that goes in the front of the bed
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.680]   and they target it to that world of trucking as well.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   So if you're interested in that,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.200]   if you have a pickup truck, there are options there for you,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.000]   but I still don't think it's ideal.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.220]   Next would be a full-size van.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.840]   And a full-size van is a wonderful option for two people.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.080]   It really is.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.920]   Or it's a great option
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.280]   if you're gonna be on the road full-time
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   and you're gonna be living in a full-size van all the time.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.960]   There are many good things to say about a full-size van.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.200]   There are many manufactured RVs
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.760]   that are built upon a full-size van chassis.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.000]   And you can get a large high roof,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.800]   you can get a large high roof sprinter van
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.760]   or modern variation of that.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.400]   Lots of the manufacturers now have high roof vans
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.880]   and very long.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.600]   And these vans can be very spacious
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.480]   for a couple of people to be in.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   I previously owned a, what's called a class B motorhome,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.080]   which is built upon a van chassis.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.240]   And we loved that thing.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.280]   It was awesome.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.440]   And you can do that as well.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.680]   The problem with the full-size van
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   or an RV that's built upon that platform
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.600]   is it's still pretty big.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.860]   And which means it's still pretty inefficient on fuel.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.120]   My class B motorhome or my other full-size vans
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.680]   have frequently gotten 10 to 13 miles per gallon
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.640]   on the highway, sometimes as high as 15,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.400]   but that's not abnormal.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.420]   Now, often you have to look at what you're doing.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.400]   Are you living in it?
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.080]   Are you traveling in it, et cetera?
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.040]   But that miles per gallon can add substantially
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.480]   to your cost if you're traveling long distances.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.360]   So full-size van, there's a world out there,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.600]   both commercial and DIY.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.180]   I think it's a good solution,
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.460]   but it's not, in my opinion, the sweet spot.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.600]   I continue to be convinced that a minivan
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.080]   is the sweet spot for one person,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.480]   either as a traveling rig or as a living rig.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.720]   And let me explain why.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.320]   Minivans can be found cheap.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.440]   You can buy, if you're willing to buy a Kia Sedona,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.860]   Hyundai Entourage, you can buy one of the Korean minivans
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.120]   that's less than 10 years old,
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.700]   was less than 100,000 miles,
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.000]   you can pick 'em up for four grand.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.200]   And these are good, useful minivans
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.400]   with a ton of life left in them.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.020]   They're a knockoff, basically,
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.300]   of the Toyota and the Honda designs.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.400]   The Toyotas and the Hondas are also available.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   Whatever you find, you can buy a great van
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   for under $4,000 all day long on Craigslist.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.560]   You can buy them even cheaper.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.820]   The last minivan that I bought, I bought a nice Toyota,
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.600]   paid 3,000 bucks for it, the thing is great.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.400]   And it's very reliable and wonderful.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   The minivan has the benefit of being very easy to drive.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.760]   They're built to be easy to drive.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.860]   In a past episode of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.040]   where I shared with you that your only car
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.520]   should be a minivan, I explained to you
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.860]   how minivans have greater cargo volume
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.520]   than even a big SUV like a Suburban.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.560]   I explained to you that they have a tighter turning radius
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.160]   than a small SUV like an Escape.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.660]   They have better gas mileage
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.840]   than any kind of SUV, basically.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.060]   You can frequently get 25 miles per gallon
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.000]   on the highway with a minivan.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.620]   And that's wonderful, that's really, really good.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.800]   But the benefit of the minivan
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.040]   is you get a ton of interior space.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.920]   Because of the way that minivans are constructed,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.440]   they have a very low load floor and a high ceiling.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.840]   And so you get a lot of interior space.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.880]   You get a very usable platform
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.120]   and you get a lot of interior space
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.760]   with still some of those benefits
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.720]   of good gas mileage, easy parkability.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.320]   They're just small and nimble
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.200]   as compared to a full-size van.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.640]   So, inexpensively available,
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.840]   lot of interior space, small and nimble,
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.040]   cheap to buy because there's a large supply,
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.800]   cheap to own because there's a large supply,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   reliable, I mean, they're just a wonderful vehicle.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.320]   But what about camping in 'em?
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.720]   What do you actually do?
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.080]   For camping inside, a minivan is great
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.680]   because with no modifications,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.280]   you can fit a twin-size mattress in the back
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.800]   and have a little bit of room left to spare.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.120]   Now, there's all kinds of things,
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.560]   and again, I'm focusing on one person,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.920]   there's all kinds of modifications
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.000]   that you can make if you want to.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.720]   There are people who will build platforms
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   for storage boxes, platforms for kitchen equipment, et cetera,
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.800]   and put mattress on top, that's fine.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.760]   But you can take a standard minivan
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.720]   from almost any manufacturer,
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   as long as it's not one of the older, tiny ones.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.680]   But Dodge, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, doesn't matter.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.840]   Any of the modern ones that are 10 years old or newer,
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.120]   and you can just take the seats out,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.920]   fold them flat, or take them out.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.400]   All of them now have the flat seats in the rear row,
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.160]   and you either remove the middle row seats
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   or fold them flat as well.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.200]   You could just take that thing,
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.640]   toss a twin-size mattress right in the back,
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.640]   and you have a comfortable, normal mattress
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.380]   on a flat load floor that will fit any size person.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.000]   That's the benefit.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.860]   You get a comfortable mattress,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.240]   an actual, real bed with no modification.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.940]   And because of the high interior height,
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.820]   you have living area.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.100]   Now you can't stand up, obviously.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.540]   You can't stand up.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.220]   That's one of the benefits of a full-size van.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.540]   You can stand up, especially if you have a raised roof,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.700]   you can stand up, you can use that all to get dressed,
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.200]   et cetera, but it's not a claustrophobic space.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.700]   I frequently have found it very easy to hang out
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.580]   in the back of a minivan, sitting on a twin-size mattress,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.860]   and I can sit, I can work on my computer comfortably.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.460]   I've recorded episodes of "Radical Personal Finance"
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.620]   sitting on a mattress in the back of my minivan.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.660]   You would have no idea which ones they were.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.420]   And I can just sit and work comfortably
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.040]   for a very long period of time.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.100]   They're easy, no modifications needed.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.380]   Twin-size mattress, normal bed.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.620]   That leads to good sleep.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:02.620]   And it's superior to all of the other options for sleeping,
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.660]   which are in a car or even the Prius,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.500]   you can't put a real mattress in 'em.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.180]   You're limited to some kind of camping mattress.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.060]   You're limited to some kind of thin air mattress,
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.300]   which is fine for a short period of time,
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   but it's not as truly comfortable as a real spring mattress
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.180]   or a real foam mattress, if you're into a foam mattress.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.220]   That is huge.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.740]   Huge. (laughs)
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.540]   It's a big, big deal.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.260]   That living space means that you can hang out
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.060]   inside of a minivan very comfortably.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.860]   So if you're traveling and it's a rainy day
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.340]   and you're not on the road, you can be inside of the van
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.580]   and you have a few different positions inside of it.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.460]   If you need to sit up,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.340]   you can always use the passenger front seat.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.280]   I've done that frequently.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.820]   You sit in the passenger front seat,
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.900]   work comfortably on a laptop,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.740]   or you can sit Indian style on a bed in the back,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.220]   or you can lie down and read,
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.140]   or of course, one of the pieces of equipment
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.420]   that's good to take with you
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   is you can carry a chair with you and use that.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.460]   If you need an additional seat,
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.060]   one thing I have done in the past
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.560]   is instead of using a real coil spring mattress,
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.580]   I've used an air mattress.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.700]   You can get a small air mattress
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.700]   and that can work well for you.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.400]   It can put you in a situation
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.320]   where you can actually pivot it.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   It's a little smaller
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.500]   and you can have a third seat in the back as well.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:33.360]   Because minivans, most of them now have doors on both sides,
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.160]   if you're in a place where you can just open up the doors
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.000]   and you wanna work in your minivan,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.040]   you can pull it up into a beautiful park underneath a tree
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.480]   or down by the ocean or down by the river.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.120]   Evidently, that's a cultural meme.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.240]   Living in a van down by the river,
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.800]   you can pull it down by the river.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.060]   You can open up the two big sliding doors on either side.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.540]   You can open up the back hatch
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.840]   and now you have a big, airy, comfortable place to be
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.660]   to hang out, which is really, really nice.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.160]   So a minivan is vastly superior
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.780]   with the ability for you to just simply be very comfortable,
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:11.400]   very comfortable in a real sized mattress on the road.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.240]   And that sleeping quality is important,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.940]   especially if you were considering
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.840]   staying in it for a long period of time.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.280]   Now, another big benefit of the minivan
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.260]   is the climate control system.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.620]   So a minivan is inferior to something like a hybrid.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.340]   I'm not aware of any hybrid minivans yet,
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.200]   but in the future, maybe we'll have those.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.220]   It's inferior to a Prius
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.720]   because if you're gonna run the air conditioning all night,
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.000]   you have to actually run the air conditioning all night.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.300]   But I've done it and I've measured it.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.360]   And you'll often find
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.080]   that if you just run the vehicle all night long
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.920]   and you run the air conditioning all night long,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.200]   you can sleep well,
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.320]   and it'll use about three gallons of gas,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.000]   two or three gallons of gas,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.840]   depending on the size of your vehicle.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.040]   Now, that's obviously cost,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.680]   puts wear and tear on the engine.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.080]   But if you compare that cost
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.320]   for the times when it's so hot and so humid
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.480]   or perhaps raining,
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.520]   and you can't be comfortable without the air conditioning,
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.120]   that's a very low cost,
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.940]   very, very low cost, comparatively speaking.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.800]   Now, a quick safety tip,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.720]   make sure you have a carbon monoxide detector in the car.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.560]   It's easy to have a carbon monoxide detector
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.080]   so that in case there is an exhaust leak,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.440]   in case the vehicle is leaking in some way
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.760]   and there's carbon monoxide coming into the car,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.880]   you wanna make sure you have a carbon monoxide detector
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.720]   ready for you.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.840]   That's a standard piece of safety equipment
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.940]   I really recommend.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.360]   The likelihood is very low,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.800]   but it is possible and it's cheap to protect
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.720]   against that risk.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.160]   That climate control system, however, is very valuable.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.360]   It means that when you're hot and it's humid,
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.100]   you can have air conditioning.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.680]   The other big benefit is what if you're in a place
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.040]   where it's cold?
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.620]   Well, cold is easier to deal with
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.680]   because you can deal with cold while you're sleeping
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.400]   with insulation, with blankets
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.520]   and a cold weather sleeping bag.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.040]   This past week, as I have been staying in my minivan,
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.060]   it's been pretty cold.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.760]   I've needed a couple of blankets.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.920]   But the best thing about a minivan
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.740]   is even if it's snowing,
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.760]   you can be warm if you put on enough blankets
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.380]   and you can be warm if you put on enough
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.740]   of a good enough sleeping bag.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.960]   But when the morning all you do is get up,
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.000]   flip the van on and turn the heater on
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.080]   and there are front air conditioning vents
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.840]   and rear air conditioning vents,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.240]   crawl back into your sleeping bag
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.320]   and about 10 minutes later,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.880]   you'll have a toasty warm interior space.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   So if you're living in a minivan full time
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.120]   and even if you're a college student
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.400]   and you're going to class in a cold weather place,
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.360]   you can turn it on, run the van for 30 minutes
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   in the morning while you're getting dressed,
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.440]   getting everything ready
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.720]   and that doesn't take very much fuel.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.220]   Just a little bit of fuel to be warm.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.220]   And you don't have to deal with having the external heater.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.260]   You don't have to deal with the extra propane heater
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.220]   or whatever your other heating mechanism are
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.280]   is because it's built into the van.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.420]   It makes it simple and easy.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.100]   What else is great about a minivan?
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.440]   The electrical system.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.980]   Minivans are built for people to go and families,
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.100]   which means they have electrical outlets.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.500]   Some of the modern ones have a built in 120 volt system,
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.160]   an alternating current electrical system
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.480]   with a built in inverter.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.420]   Mine doesn't, but what mine does have
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.040]   is it has multiple 12 volt sockets that are live,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.720]   whether or not the key is on or not.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.560]   So you have of course,
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.360]   the 12 volt cigarette lighter plug up front.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.560]   That's very useful.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.600]   But almost every mini, all my minivans
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.060]   have in the back as well.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.160]   So you have a 12 volt socket in the back.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.400]   This can be very helpful
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.040]   because you have a battery that's sufficient
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.600]   to run 12 volt stuff on pretty consistently.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.120]   So for my computers, one thing I always buy for my computers,
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.460]   I always buy a cigarette lighter adapter,
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.640]   which allows me to run the computer directly on DC current.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.840]   That's more efficient than running an inverter.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.280]   So if you need a laptop, you can plug your laptop in
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.800]   and run right from the power system
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.640]   that's built into the van.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.920]   You don't have to buy something extra.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.520]   You don't have to build something extra.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.720]   It's built into the van.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.840]   It's the battery that's up front underneath the hood.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.180]   You can of course run anything
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.380]   and charge anything that runs on USB.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.940]   You just plug your little USB cigarette lighter adapter in,
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.280]   you run your phone,
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.640]   get yourself a six foot or a 10 foot USB cord to your phone.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.760]   And you now have the ability to charge your phone overnight
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.120]   while you're sleeping.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.800]   Or, and or, you get yourself an inverter.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.920]   I recommend getting a small one and also a larger one.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.600]   So the small one is nice,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.760]   like up to 300 watts or so.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.720]   A small one is nice
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.760]   because you can plug it right into the cigarette lighter
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.080]   right there in the back of your van.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.820]   So if you have a small electrical appliances
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.460]   that are gonna be under that wattage,
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.300]   you can use the electrical system that's in the van.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.980]   You just plug your inverter into the 12 volt system.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.900]   It inverts the direct current into alternating current.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.320]   And you can use small appliances,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.380]   whatever it is that you need to do.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.860]   I've used this for blowing up an air mattress.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.700]   You buy an air mattress,
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.700]   a lot of times now the cheap ones have the blower built in.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.060]   And so you can blow it up and put it down.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.640]   It's all built in right to the van.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.560]   If you're gonna run an appliance
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.700]   for a significant amount of time,
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.900]   just turn the engine on in the van
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.780]   and use the engine as a generator.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.780]   Or of course, carry a larger one.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.260]   And you can carry a larger one and pop the hood
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.580]   and connect to the hood and use that to run
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.460]   any kind of larger electrical equipment that you have.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.100]   One thing I have done, found very easy,
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.500]   you can actually put the inverter on.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.060]   You can find a place under the hood that's safe,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.860]   put a little platform for the inverter,
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   and then just run your electrical cord from the front
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.780]   right into the vehicle.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.500]   Now you have an electrical cord
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.700]   that can run larger current draw equipment
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.640]   inside the vehicle.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.380]   It's fun, sorry, it's, I guess it's fun.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.820]   I'm having fun describing it to you,
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.000]   but it's easy and it works.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.460]   The inverter is simple.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.720]   It's really, really nice.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.240]   So when you start putting these things together,
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.700]   a lot of your basic equipment is there and it's built in.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.460]   You don't have to do a lot of modifications.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.420]   Is it as good as having a nice RV
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.340]   with a built-in toilet and all that?
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.180]   No, it's not.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.860]   It's definitely not.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.140]   But is it adequate?
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.460]   Is it adequate for one person with an adventurous spirit?
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.060]   I think it's more than adequate.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.340]   There are people all around the world
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.700]   who don't live nearly as well every day.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.640]   And I could very happily, very pleasantly,
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.780]   without feeling like I was suffering,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.380]   I could very easily, as a single person,
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.260]   live in a minivan for an extended period of time,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.220]   traveling or living for an extended period of time.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.020]   And I would be willing to make that choice.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.420]   If I were gonna go back today, now we're 18 years old,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.460]   now we're looking at my college living expenses
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.300]   or things like that,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.760]   personally, if I were gonna do it again,
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.420]   I would do that and I would save the $30,000
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.340]   that I spent on living expenses during those college years.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.280]   And I would use that and I would invest the money instead
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.740]   to build a stronger foundation for my financial future.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.780]   This is different than at other stages of life,
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.900]   when you're wealthy or when you have other people.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.160]   I would not, unless we were forced to,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.040]   I would not live with my family in a van, certainly not.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.300]   But when you're young and you're single and you're flexible,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.420]   there are tremendous opportunities.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.220]   Let's talk about necessary and valuable equipment.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.020]   I talked about a comfortable mattress already.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.220]   Safety equipment, carbon monoxide detector,
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.340]   make sure you have one of those just to make sure.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.460]   Test it as well.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.140]   I recommend having a fire extinguisher.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.420]   You should always have a fire extinguisher
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.140]   in all of your vehicles.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.980]   How dumb to have your car burned down
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.940]   because you didn't have a fire extinguisher.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.420]   I talked about an inverter, having an inverter.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.740]   Other basic and important equipment
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.840]   is you wanna make sure that you have
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.700]   some tinting on the windows
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.520]   and a sunshade for the front window for privacy.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.400]   Now, many, many vans come from the factory
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.620]   with dark tinting all around.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.340]   So once again, this doesn't require you to do anything.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.440]   If yours doesn't, then you can go ahead and tint it.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.800]   Get a sunshade for the front window
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.660]   so to enhance your privacy.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.700]   Many times what you'll find
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.140]   is when you're sleeping in a vehicle,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.380]   you'll be sleeping in a place where there are other people
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.260]   and that privacy will be valuable for you.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.220]   Some people will go ahead and modify their vehicle
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.300]   by installing curtains.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.760]   You can do this with Velcro.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.660]   You can do this with snaps.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.660]   You may do that.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.920]   If and if I were doing it full-time, I would consider it.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.340]   Some people also will add insulation to their vehicle.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.440]   The most popular product is a product called Reflectix.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.140]   You can get it at the local home improvement store.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.460]   They sell it in large rolls,
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   but it's this shiny, silvery bubble insulation material
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.300]   that'll help you to stay warmer in the winter
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.740]   and cooler in the summer.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.020]   I don't think I would do that
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.700]   unless I were living in the van full-time,
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.300]   but if I were, just a tip for you,
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.100]   don't put the shiny silver Reflectix up to the window.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.260]   Make sure you have a black curtain
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.260]   or perhaps a black piece of cardboard.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.620]   Make sure that your vehicle
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.560]   just looks like it has dark windows
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.340]   so that you can camp in places that are populated
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.260]   and you don't have to worry about someone
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.840]   knowing that you look like you're living in a van.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.960]   I think that stealth camping is really valuable.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.140]   We've all known people, I think,
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.200]   who've lived in their vehicles,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:05.940]   and the front dash is filled with junk.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.420]   The vehicle's filled with junk.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.100]   That's not me, I don't like junk.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.300]   So dark tinting and a sunshade are valuable.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.380]   Cold weather sleeping bag blankets is important,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.540]   especially if you're gonna be where it's cold.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.060]   And then my big philosophy
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.300]   is try not to have a ton of stuff.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.940]   The more stuff you have, the worse it is.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.220]   If you have just a few things with you,
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.340]   you won't feel oppressed,
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.220]   you won't feel like you're suffering.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.840]   If you have tons of stuff with you,
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.700]   then you constantly feel like you're digging through stuff
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.380]   and now it just gets really annoying.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.340]   It gets really annoying, like I need a big dresser.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.580]   Well, yes, because you have too much junk.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.540]   So try not to have too much junk.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.560]   One thing, one philosophy I've developed
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   is that stuff is really oppressive
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.040]   if it's not modularized and organized.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.320]   It's not so annoying to have larger amounts of things
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.720]   if they're modularized and organized.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.200]   So I always like to have nice organized modules for stuff.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.560]   In my home, that means I try to just keep everything
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.660]   and I use bags for most things, boxes are fine,
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.400]   but keeping things in modules,
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.220]   things that go together, go together.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.640]   So all the cables are in one place,
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.040]   all of the miscellaneous things are kept together.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.720]   That allows me to have more things,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.060]   but not to be so obnoxious to have those things.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.000]   This is to me, the practical balance
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.680]   between excessive junk everywhere
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.600]   being oppressive to you and minimalism,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.960]   where you get rid of all the stuff that's useful,
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.400]   is to have things organized into nice modules.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.360]   In a van, soft modules are better than hard.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.240]   A standard van, you put a twin mattress in,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.160]   you slide it over to the side,
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.160]   there's enough room down the side
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.720]   to put some normal size duffel bags,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.040]   and then you have some hanging shirts
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.240]   or things that you don't wanna have wrinkled,
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.700]   then you could put those along the side.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.920]   So that's my recommendation, is keep soft modules,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.280]   soft duffel bags with bags in them as well.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.440]   That works really well.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.960]   I recommend that you consider having some cooking gear.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.540]   I think the best, most practical solution here
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.400]   is a small butane stove.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.120]   This is what I travel with, is a small butane stove,
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.800]   single burner gas stove, runs on a little butane bottle.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.760]   So it's the kind of thing, if you stay in a nice hotel,
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.680]   they'll usually use these stoves for the omelet station.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.160]   You'll frequently see them used for that.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.680]   That works great, it gives you a stove to cook on.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.960]   And you can keep a small stove, some simple pots and pans.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.040]   I like to travel with a French press to make coffee.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.920]   And that allows you to have a small cooking kit
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.640]   held in a small duffel bag.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.820]   So if you're gonna get up in the morning
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.100]   and you wanna cook, then you pull, or make some coffee,
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.720]   then you go ahead and just find a park
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.080]   or a picnic table, or if you're at a rest area on the highway
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.720]   it takes about 10 minutes, just grab your stove,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.960]   take your little bag over to the table,
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.680]   set up your stove, and you're good to go.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.640]   And you can make a little pot of coffee very easily.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.080]   So I think it's worth it to have
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.480]   a little bit of cooking gear.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.120]   Because when you're on the road, the two big expenses are,
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.040]   well, three big expenses are cost of getting there,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.200]   plane tickets and/or cost of gas.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.940]   We're trying to minimize that by having a vehicle
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.820]   that has decent gas mileage.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.900]   Cost of accommodation, this is usually the huge cost,
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.140]   especially if you're going to a big city conference
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.520]   or something like that, $150 a night
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.580]   is not an abnormal cost, or even more sometimes.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.000]   And then the cost of food.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.340]   When food is taken out of your control
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.340]   and you're at the mercy of the restaurants around,
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.080]   oftentimes that can be a substantial cost for you.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.260]   So having a little bit of cooking gear helps as well.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.460]   Next piece of gear is having a cooler.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.180]   And since the modern injection molded coolers
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.040]   have kind of taken over the market,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.480]   that's kind of the term for,
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.540]   sorry, it's the roto-molded coolers,
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.520]   like the Yeti brand that you see a lot of places.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.260]   These modern coolers have changed
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.680]   much of the cooling technology.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.620]   So the Yeti, it's probably the most popular brand name
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.580]   in the roto-molded coolers,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.500]   they've come out with soft coolers.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.480]   And you can now buy these in the,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.180]   kind of the knockoff marketplace.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.480]   We can buy one of these soft coolers
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.820]   that has a good thick foam insulation,
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.460]   and they do really well,
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.580]   but they're very, very flexible inside a vehicle,
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.520]   and they're small.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.620]   I'm not talking here about the very thin lunch coolers
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.580]   that just have very little insulation,
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.420]   but you don't want, in a van,
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.800]   you don't want a big square plastic thing
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.700]   that's getting in your way.
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.060]   You want a small, compact cooler.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.860]   So I have one from Walmart that just does a great job.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.700]   It'll keep a bag of ice for multiple days,
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.000]   and that allows you to keep your food cold,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.620]   which is really worth considering.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.180]   And it's small enough and simple enough
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.580]   to be useful and not to be oppressive
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.940]   inside a small minivan.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.780]   Make sure you have a comfortable chair to sit in outside.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.540]   The whole point of doing something like this
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.540]   is to get outside when the weather's beautiful.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.620]   So you want something small,
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.420]   but something comfortable that you can sit in outside.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.940]   Make sure that you carry with you an eye mask
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.400]   in case it's light.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.980]   One of the biggest challenges,
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.220]   the places that are easy to sleep
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.340]   and safe to sleep when you're on the road,
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.900]   for example, a rest stop or a truck stop,
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.980]   many of these places are very bright.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.320]   Now, that bright light is nice for safety,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.540]   but it's often not so nice when you're sleeping.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.200]   And if you're in a vehicle that has open windows
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.880]   and you don't have curtains,
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.580]   then sometimes the angles,
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.820]   if you're lying down in the back,
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.460]   the angles of the bright truck stop sign
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.940]   or the bright light will just come right in
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:44.860]   and be right in your face.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.820]   So carry an eye mask with you.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.060]   Other equipment that's important, gym membership.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.620]   The best, easiest place to get a shower on the road,
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.720]   'cause of course, what do you do about bathroom facilities?
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.980]   Well, bathrooms are easy to find.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.140]   And as an adult, those are easy to find
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.660]   and easy to deal with.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.980]   And then for showering,
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.980]   you can use either a national large gym franchise
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:10.440]   or what I found many times,
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.220]   just go to a local gym, explain to them,
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.300]   hey, I'm traveling, I'm staying in my car,
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.820]   I need to take a shower, may I take a shower?
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.460]   And they'll allow you to take a shower.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:19.260]   At the, in the worst case scenario,
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.420]   if you have to pay for one,
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.260]   you can always take a shower at a truck stop.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.900]   They're expensive, they're not cheap.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.660]   That's the same thing, not cheap and expensive.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.640]   They're expensive, but in a pinch, it'll do.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.940]   And make sure you also just travel
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.780]   with washcloths and baby wipes.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.220]   There have been times where I've needed a shower
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.020]   and I couldn't find facilities.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.100]   And so in those circumstances,
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.540]   you wanna make sure that you have a washcloth,
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.980]   then you find a public restroom where you have privacy
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.020]   and you can use a washcloth to freshen up
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.340]   and or baby wipes are very useful.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.420]   In terms of, I glossed over bathroom facilities.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.980]   For most adults, bathroom facilities should be fine
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.820]   and easy to find.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.280]   There's plenty of public bathroom facilities.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.140]   Some people who are living in larger vans
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.480]   or larger vehicles will use things like a cassette toilet.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.540]   There's a technology called a cassette toilet
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.540]   that even many RVers will use.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.260]   Those are fine, they're very practical.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.580]   There's not enough room in a minivan to use one.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.820]   So you'll just wanna use public restrooms
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.820]   and or make temporary accommodations in your vehicle,
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.600]   just like you do when you are in a tent.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.580]   Have a pee bottle or something like that.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.440]   Next, where can you sleep?
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.340]   Basically almost anywhere,
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.140]   especially if you have a minivan with dark windows.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.900]   I have stayed in parking garages in big cities.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.660]   This can actually be great in the winter time.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.100]   Sometimes if you're in a big city
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.380]   and you're traveling in the winter time when it's cold,
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.020]   if you find a parking garage in a city
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.560]   where there are basement facilities,
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.300]   you go down below, the parking garage can be very warm
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.980]   and that can help you to sleep more comfortably.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.380]   So I've stayed on the fifth floor of a parking garage
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.860]   and then four floors underneath the surface street.
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.500]   And sometimes that's your best bet.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.900]   Yes, you pay for parking,
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.660]   but when you're in a big city,
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.580]   your hotel costs are generally just massive.
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.980]   And frequently, if you are staying in a car,
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.160]   you can be right at your whatever it is.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.020]   If you have to go to a business conference
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.620]   or if you're a sightseeing, you can be right in the city
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.220]   and paying $10 for 24 hours of parking in a parking garage
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:18.060]   is a lot better than paying $300
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.500]   for a mediocre room in that hotel.
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.700]   You can stay in parking lots, obviously, almost anywhere.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.980]   In cities, you can stay in, I've stated,
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.580]   paid parking lots if you're in a city
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.740]   or just about any parking lot,
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.300]   or of course, the parking lot of almost any business.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.900]   Walmart is well-known for being accepting
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.700]   of people staying in their vehicles, especially RVers.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.380]   So you can easily stay in most Walmart parking lots.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.260]   There are other cities that have this as a,
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.720]   sorry, other businesses that have this as a standard,
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.540]   a standard protocol or a standard procedure.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.860]   For example, Cracker Barrel.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.380]   Cracker Barrel, if you're an RVer,
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.220]   you can always stay at a Cracker Barrel in a park
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.340]   without being, fear of being hassled by somebody.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.180]   Cabela's or other sporting goods stores
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:07.580]   will often have this policy as well.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.900]   But really, just about anywhere.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.940]   There's a local, in my local Home Depot,
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.140]   there's a van dweller who lives
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.260]   in the Home Depot parking lot that I always notice.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.520]   I always notice him in there.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.540]   So big, just any major parking lot.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.860]   And of course, you can do this on city streets.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.140]   On multiple times, I have stayed on city streets.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.300]   The benefit of a city street is you can often find
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.060]   a dark spot that gives a very nice sleeping environment.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.220]   And so you just usually wanna be unobtrusive
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:40.420]   and respectful of the residents of that city street.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.660]   And of course, when you're on the highway,
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.500]   some of the simplest and easiest places,
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.900]   if there's a rest area near to you.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.240]   A rest area on a highway is great.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.140]   Many rest areas will have nighttime security.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.900]   So that's good for having a secure location.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.900]   Always pay attention to your safety.
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.900]   But it's also a normal place for people to be.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.780]   Remember, truckers live in their vehicles
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.940]   when they're on the road.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.660]   And so the rest stops and the truck stops
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.580]   are filled with truckers sleeping in their car.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.040]   So it's not out of place if you're in a rest area.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.700]   You go in and you use the restroom,
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.760]   you brush your teeth, things like that,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.100]   that sometimes can be a little out of place in other places.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.180]   If you're near a rest area, truck stops, et cetera,
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.660]   places where the truckers are,
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.540]   that's a very normal, normal place.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.780]   But what I have found is if you have a small vehicle
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.500]   that's unobtrusive and you're just discreet
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.580]   in your behavior and your actions, you can sleep anywhere.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.340]   And as a traveler, it's pretty cool
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.460]   to be able to be right in the middle of a downtown place
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.180]   where you're gonna do big tours and things like that
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.980]   and to be very comfortable
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.740]   and yet to be able to do it inexpensively.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.860]   Now, what about if you were doing this for the long term?
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.100]   Probably today it's so much easier than it ever was.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.660]   With internet connection right on your cell phone,
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:54.940]   you have the electricity right there in the van
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.060]   like I've described with an inverter if you need it
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.940]   or just pull directly from the 12 volt power.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.740]   You've got restrooms and things like that all around.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.980]   I mean, it's so much easier today
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.900]   than it ever was in the past.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.220]   The only, I guess, other consideration
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.820]   would be mail, mail forwarding services.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.060]   If I were a college student, of course,
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.900]   college students often will have a mailbox on campus.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.260]   Or if I were traveling long term,
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.100]   I would just sign up with one
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.620]   of the mail forwarding services
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.900]   that cater to the RV community and that would be great
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:23.340]   or rent a post office box.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:26.140]   But there's no reason why you can't,
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.780]   you couldn't do this long term.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.060]   There's no reason why whatsoever.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.260]   Now, when should you not live in a van?
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.860]   Or when should you not stay in a van?
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.020]   I think number one,
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.140]   when it impedes your overall performance.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.020]   So I choose not to do this
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.700]   when I'm giving something like an important speech.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.220]   If I'm giving an important speech
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.740]   and I wanna make sure that,
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.980]   then I wanna make sure if I'm speaking from stage
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.460]   that I'm feeling confident, that I'm doing well.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.260]   I wanna make sure that my, you know,
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.900]   my clothes are right, my hair is right,
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.180]   all of those kinds of things.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.340]   I've often found that I just often feel
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.460]   just a little tiny bit off when I'm in a van.
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.620]   So if I'm working or if there's something very important,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.380]   then I'll just go ahead and get the hotel room.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.820]   And that's just the cost of doing business.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.060]   Because it's more important to me
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.340]   that I'm at my top, my peak shape
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.580]   than that I save $100.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:17.700]   But that tiny bit off that I'm describing is not,
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.300]   you know, it's not,
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.740]   that's not a big deal most of the time.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.180]   I think if I were living in a vehicle for the longterm,
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.260]   I would get over it and it would just be normal.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.700]   But that it's just the tiniest little bit
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.900]   of kind of being out of sync.
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   And frankly, I think it's more the social aspects of it,
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.780]   the social stigma versus the any actual practical effect.
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.500]   If you're in a place where it's nice and cool
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.420]   and you have a nice comfortable bed and you sleep well,
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.260]   everything's fine.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.980]   You can use a restroom, you can freshen up,
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.180]   you can go to the gym, take a shower, everything is fine.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.500]   But because you're kind of on the fringes of society,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.580]   if you're staying in a vehicle,
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.820]   you're kind of always on the fringe.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.580]   You're never in that same place
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.780]   where all the normal people are.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.100]   You're never in your normal house.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.260]   You're never in your normal apartment.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.980]   You're never in your normal hotel room.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.660]   You're always kind of on this fringe
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.820]   that has a bit of a psychological effect.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.660]   And so one thing I've learned
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.900]   is that I don't do it
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.420]   if I have an important business engagement
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.620]   or if I'm giving an important speech
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.920]   or if I have important meetings or something like that there.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.460]   I don't wanna lose even the littlest bit of an edge.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.900]   But in terms of the rest of the time,
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:34.420]   there are big savings in money
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.720]   and in the early stages of your wealth building,
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.340]   that's so valuable to save those hundreds
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.640]   and hundreds of dollars,
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.860]   but yet still be able to have the big experiences
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.980]   because I wanna live a rich life,
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.520]   which doesn't mean being a hermit and not doing anything,
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.940]   but I wanna live a rich life well.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.300]   And then my final piece of advice,
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.220]   make sure you're careful of the way that you're eating
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:56.260]   and make sure you're not just eating junk all the time.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.100]   When you're on the road,
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.700]   and this is one of the reasons why I think it's important
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.620]   and valuable to have cooking equipment
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.320]   and to have a cooler with you,
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.500]   be careful how you eat
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.020]   'cause it's too easy to eat junk and then you feel bad.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.020]   But the reason you feel bad
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.900]   is not because you were living in your van.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.620]   The reason you feel bad is 'cause you've been eating junk.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.660]   So that's where I try to make sure
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:17.020]   that I have refrigeration capability with a cooler
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.100]   and a little bit of cooking capability as well
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.760]   so that I can eat quality food.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.340]   So that's it, those are my ideas.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.320]   Those are my recommendations for you
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.220]   on how to live in a van and love it,
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.180]   or live in your car and love it.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.300]   If you've done this, feel free to come by the show.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.860]   Tell me about it, radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.860]   I'd love to hear about it.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.220]   And I hope that this is helpful
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.580]   and inspirational to many more of you.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:44.500]   Listen, if you wanna live well and get rich, it's possible.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.780]   You don't have to just sit around and do nothing.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.860]   You don't have to say,
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.660]   well, either I'm gonna travel
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.860]   and spend thousands of dollars traveling,
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.600]   or I'm not gonna travel at all 'cause I can't afford it.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.420]   It's a completely false choice.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.060]   You can live well and live on a great adventure
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.900]   and save money the whole way.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.420]   Just think outside the box
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.540]   and look at the opportunities that are around you
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.580]   and don't be scared to buck society's trends.
