[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Nicky Simasek from Birmingham, Alabama writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.520]   my 13 year old son Drew is a deep thinker. This morning at breakfast we were
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.680]   reading Deuteronomy 10. When I got done reading, Drew looked at me, visibly
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760]   frustrated and a bit emotional, and said, 'Mom, why does the Bible contradict
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.280]   itself?' In Deuteronomy 10 it says the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.500]   no partiality, yet in Romans 9 it says, 'Just as it is written, "Jacob I have
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.760]   loved, but Esau I have hated." How is that not showing favoritism and partiality? I
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.120]   tried so hard to answer his question, going back to God's infinite wisdom,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.280]   sovereignty, goodness, predestination, and his desire to bring himself glory,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.320]   trusting him when we don't completely understand, but as you read on in chapter
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.560]   9, it doesn't get any easier to swallow. God has mercy on whom he wants to have
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.800]   mercy." I'm not sure I gave him such a great explanation. I said, "Well son, I
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.960]   believe you just asked me a question that I would like to ask Pastor John." What do
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.740]   you say, Pastor John? The first thing I have to say is may the Lord give this
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.280]   13 year old a humble and teachable spirit to go along with his sharp mind. I
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.820]   love sharp minds, and they are a great weapon in the hand of the Lord when they
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.840]   are wielded with a humble and wise arm. He's off to a good start with such a
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.920]   discerning mother, so praise God for that. So yes, it is a really good question. God
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.720]   is impartial, not just in the Old Testament, but the New Testament. Let me
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.680]   just underline it. Romans 2 11, God shows no partiality. Ephesians 6 9, masters do
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.120]   the same to them and stop your threatening knowing that he who is
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   their master and yours is in heaven and there is no partiality with him.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.240]   Colossians 3 25, the wrongdoer will be repaid back for his wrongdoing that he
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.560]   has done. There is no partiality with God. So in every one of these cases, the Greek
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.360]   word prosopolepsia—a receiving of face, literally, a receiving of face—means
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   that God does not receive or regard a person's appearance. He does not base his
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.400]   approval or blessings on considerations that are irrelevant to the choice he's
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   making, like a person's face. So we need to be really clear, what does he mean by
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.080]   partiality and impartiality? Let me use an illustration for the 13-year-old, if he
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.920]   might be tuning in. So you and your friends are trying out for the school or
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.960]   the neighborhood baseball team. What would it look like if the coach who has
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   to choose who gets to play was partial, that is, not impartial? It would look like
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.400]   this. Your coach would show partiality if he chose the white boy and not the black
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.080]   boy, even if the black boy was a better player, or if he chose his own son,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   even if his own son was a worse player, or if he chose a boy because the boy's
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   father paid him money behind the scenes. So impartiality doesn't mean you treat
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.040]   everyone alike. Everyone can't play ball, everyone can't get on the team. It
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.960]   means you don't base your favors on irrelevant considerations, like race or
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.920]   wealth or your kinship. Here's another illustration. I think a 13-year-old can
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.200]   get this one as well. If you're a judge in a courtroom and you must decide a
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.040]   murder trial, judges are supposed to be impartial. In fact, the picture of justice
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.520]   has a woman blindfolded. You say, "What in the world does that mean?"
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.200]   Impartiality does not demand that the guilty defendant gets to go free because
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.280]   everyone else is leaving the courtroom and walking out, and you got to treat
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.120]   everybody the same. So the criminal who's been convicted and found to be
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.320]   guilty, he gets to go free because we can't be impartial here, we got to treat
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.400]   everybody the same, and he gets to go free because everybody else is going
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   free. Well, nobody thinks impartiality means that. Impartiality demands that the
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:45.040]   judge not base his verdict on irrelevant considerations like race or wealth or
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.120]   intelligence or reputation in the community. If the judge favors his own
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.000]   race or wealthy people or the intelligent people or the famous
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.240]   people, he would be partial and not impartial, and he would be a lousy judge
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   and unworthy to be judge. So impartiality does not mean treating everyone the same.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.040]   It means basing your treatment of others on the right kind of
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.360]   considerations. Did the defendant actually kill the man? If he did, then he
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.600]   goes to jail. Is the kid a really good ballplayer? Then he should be on
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:40.360]   the team. Now, the question is God. God's choosing to save people, and he never,
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:49.200]   never bases his choice whom to save on the basis of irrelevant considerations.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   He never says, "I will choose Asians to save, not Hispanics." He never says, "I will
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.000]   choose wealthy people to save, not the poor. I'll choose the educated to save,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   not the uneducated, or even I'll choose the good and not the bad." God simply
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.800]   doesn't base his choices on those kinds of considerations. If he did, then he
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.560]   would be guilty of being partial, and he's not partial. That's the point of
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.960]   1 Corinthians 1:26, isn't it? "Not many of you were wise according to the worldly
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.480]   standards. Not many were powerful. Not many were of noble birth. God chose what
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.600]   is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.440]   world to shame the strong. God chose what is low and despised in the world, even
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.000]   things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.600]   might boast in the presence of God." So God's choice is based on his own hidden
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.440]   wisdom. Ephesians 1:11, "God works all things according to the counsel of his
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.480]   will." The counsel of his will. He does not base his choices on irrelevant
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.560]   considerations. He's free to choose whomever he will, and his reasons are
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.520]   never owing to our goodness. How could they be? We're all sinners deserving of
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:24.600]   death. Yet he chooses freely to save some. And the very meaning of grace in Romans
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.840]   11, 5, the very meaning of grace is that the reason he chooses us is not in
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.680]   ourselves. It's not in our own virtue or our own sinfulness. It is in his
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.480]   counsel, and he's wise in all that he does because he's guided by the highest
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.320]   considerations. And what is that consideration? Well, it was hinted
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.080]   at in that text we read from 1 Corinthians 1. What choices will humble
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   sinful men? What choices will keep men from boasting in themselves? And what
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.920]   choices will bring people to praise the glory of the grace of God?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.200]   Wonderful. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Drew and
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.360]   Nikki. Please send your questions to us via email and askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   So, is it a sin to dislike divine election? That was the question
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.280]   we addressed in episode number 224. You can find it in the podcast archive, most
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.520]   easily found in the free app for the iPhone and the Android. We will be back
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.920]   tomorrow with a new episode on the topic of intimacy within marriage. It's episode
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.840]   number 400, and it's appropriately epic, but it's not an episode for 13-year-olds.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.720]   So, just a heads up for that. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.920]   the Ask Pastor John podcast.
