[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620]   Hey guys, today we're talking about making transitions
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.480]   and pivots in your career.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.560]   Joining us is Michael Chen.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.760]   Michael, how are you doing?
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.600]   - Doing well, Tim.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   Hey, it's good to see you.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.280]   - Good to see you.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   So Michael, you and I met when we worked at LinkedIn
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.360]   in LinkedIn Learning.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.200]   It is essentially a startup at the time, right?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.280]   It was a new business, they had acquired LinkedIn Learning,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.760]   or lynda.com, and now they do this big thing.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.800]   And you were a product marketing manager at the time,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.680]   but where you started in career
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.280]   and where you've actually gone from there
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.640]   are totally different.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.320]   So can you tell us a little bit about
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.240]   maybe what you're doing now,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.480]   and then maybe start from the beginning,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.120]   like what was your life journey?
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.640]   So today I'm on the product team.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.040]   I'm a product manager and I work at Asana.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.060]   But my journey starts actually even before LinkedIn, Tim.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.680]   When we first met, I had just come out of business school.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200]   And prior to business school,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.520]   I was actually a consultant in the brand strategy world.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.360]   So a few transitions from brand to product marketing,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.520]   stint in head of marketing,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.640]   and then now I'm a product manager.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.040]   So a lot of different places that have overlapped.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.840]   - So can you tell us the very beginning,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   'cause I know that you started in consulting,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360]   and I've always wondered,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.160]   is it the right move for early career folks, right?
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.280]   Is it intense?
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.960]   And why did you choose to start off with consulting?
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   - Yeah, consulting, I would absolutely agree with you there.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.800]   I think consulting is a really good place to learn.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.420]   It's great for early career.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.920]   It's great for a lot of people coming out of graduate school
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.400]   because you get to just learn
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.760]   and see from so many different industries,
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.000]   clients, businesses,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.200]   and also just work with a lot of different types of people.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   So not only do you get to learn the job
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800]   and the hard skills and the soft skills
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   of being a business or strategy expert,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   you also learn how to work
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.820]   with just a lot of different people, personalities,
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.680]   and learn how to manage upward and downward.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.040]   So absolutely, it's a really good place to start.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   - Is it considered high stakes?
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.880]   'Cause obviously as a consultant, you're working for a firm.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.440]   They're entrusting you to go out there
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.660]   and build these relationships, right?
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.240]   So if you're describing that as early career,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.320]   like you may not have the business savvy
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.360]   or communication skills to pull it off, right?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.720]   And so is it truly a safe place
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600]   for the early career people to start,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160]   or what was your experience?
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400]   - Yeah, it's a really good point.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.080]   I think because you are early career
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.440]   and coming out of business school,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.800]   a ton of consultants as well,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.880]   and I wouldn't call them necessarily early career,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.120]   but it is a new foray into a space
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.960]   where you have to be the expert in the industry
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.640]   or the client that you're working for, right?
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.320]   High stakes, but I think what you get out of consulting
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.720]   is you build the ability to learn as fast as possible,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480]   because at some point you do have
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.200]   to become the expert of that field.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.640]   You'll see kind of this theme
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   as we talk about my different roles and careers,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.480]   but consulting is a really good place
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.920]   where you figure out a learn from your own research,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.760]   but also from the people that you are surrounded by.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.040]   If you don't know something,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.000]   there is probably someone that is around you
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   who has gone through that industry, that type of project,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   whatever it may be for me right now,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.680]   the engineers that are around me and the team
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.640]   to help me with the technical components,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.360]   there's someone that you can learn from.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.560]   And I think consulting is a place
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   where you can just really figure out
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.360]   how to learn as fast as possible
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.600]   and then become that expert in your space.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   - And how long were you a consultant for?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.840]   - For about four and a half years.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.760]   - Does that feel like the right amount of time
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.360]   to transition to client side or?
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.280]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240]   I have a lot of great friends who are career consultants.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.920]   They have gone from the associate
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.360]   into the partner track, right?
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   They've spent over a decade, two decades in consulting.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.640]   Four years I think is a good amount of time.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.240]   It was a good amount of time for me
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.840]   to have seen a lot of different types
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.600]   of projects and industries.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.960]   And it was the right amount of time for me to say,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.040]   I think I know exactly,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.200]   I've learned exactly what I've wanted to learn.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.680]   And I now wanna go to business school
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   because I am tired of being the expert in some things
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.040]   and actually wanna learn and absorb other parts of businesses
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.600]   that I may not have seen in brand and strategy consulting.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.560]   So I would say four years is a good amount of time,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.000]   especially if you're coming out of undergrad
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.600]   for the first time.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   And then that number can vary
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   depending on what your objective is,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   what you're trying to get to and learn from it.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.840]   - I would totally agree with that.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840]   It kind of mirrors my own experience.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   I didn't dive into consulting world,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.280]   but I worked at like a digital agency,
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   which operated very similarly, right?
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.240]   We're all billable.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.040]   And I agree, you're exposed,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.920]   in my world, it was like digital marketing.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   And so you're exposed to everyone doing the work
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.000]   from development to design or whatnot.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.560]   And to your point, seeing all the different industries,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.200]   'cause they are so different, right?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.800]   How you treat a B2B client versus B2C,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.960]   the approach is very, very different
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   'cause their audience is so varied.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   And you're right, it's a perfect ground
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.360]   for just to learn and expose everything,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.960]   whether it's directly or indirectly.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.800]   So I agree with you.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.760]   For anyone who's starting their career,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.280]   I would highly recommend engaging a agency or consulting
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.240]   to get your feet wet so you can discover what you want.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640]   So, all right, so you got that four and a half years
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.840]   into consulting, you decided you needed to do
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.040]   business school.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.480]   What were you hoping to get out of that?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.160]   And did you walk out with this,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.600]   like, did you achieve what you set out to do
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.080]   or did it kind of evolved as you went through school?
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.160]   A little bit of both, right?
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.240]   And I think business school is this first pivot point
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.400]   for a lot of people.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.280]   Early career, even mid career,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.040]   do I make the investment and spend all of this money
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.360]   to go to business school?
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.760]   And for me, that decision was even greater
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.560]   because I did my undergrad in business.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.000]   So the question was,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.520]   is this going to be repetitive and duplicative
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.080]   to what I've already picked up?
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.040]   Or is it going to be a really great stepping stone
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.960]   to advance my career?
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.880]   And the answer has turned out to be the latter.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.760]   It's really good.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.600]   So I went into business school initially with the thought of,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.080]   hey, I want to transition away from being the consultant
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.760]   where my deliverables were mostly PowerPoints strategy
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   and being removed from the actual execution
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.200]   and operation of the work,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.960]   to learning how to take those ideas
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.760]   and bringing it to life, right?
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.640]   I have always been more of a creative hands-on person
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   and delivering strategy is fun,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.320]   but I wanted to be more involved in how it comes to life.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.600]   So I went to business school hoping to make that transition.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.000]   I actually wrote my business school essay
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.240]   around working in ed tech.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.000]   So education tech, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.160]   That was initially what I wanted to go into.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.600]   LinkedIn Learning, Tim, as you kind of alluded to,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.800]   was the realization of that in a slightly different space,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.360]   more of the enterprise benefits space.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.000]   But it was really,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.600]   I went into business school wanting to learn about
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.720]   what are the other parts of business
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.680]   that would be incredibly important
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.000]   to actually get my hands on those operational pieces.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.560]   So I was in marketing and brand.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.360]   Can I learn the operations pieces, the finance pieces,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.400]   and other areas of business that would make me full
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   and well-rounded enough?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.840]   And then try to see if I can get into the industry.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.560]   And tech was, of course, and still is a very hot industry.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.400]   LinkedIn, LinkedIn Learning became the culmination of
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.920]   not only the skill sets, the industry,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.680]   but also the subject matter that I wanted to get into.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.080]   So I kind of checked all the boxes there.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.040]   - Yeah, I'm wondering, you know,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   when you're in business school
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   and you're exploring all these various functions
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.040]   within an organization and by industry,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.960]   for me that usually screams like a executive type aspiration
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   where like you need to have enough experience
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.160]   in all these areas to be a C-level executive, right?
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.400]   'Cause you need to have experience.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.560]   Is that kind of your end goal coming out of that?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.800]   Or was it a little more near term where,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.320]   you know, it allowed you to kind of distinguish,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.360]   you know, marketing out of all these things
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   is the track you want to start.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.120]   Like, how do you make the decision between like
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   applying what you just said to product side
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.080]   right out of the gate versus marketing
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.640]   or even anything else?
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.040]   - Yeah, the great thing about business school
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.880]   is that people come from all different walks of life,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   all different industries and backgrounds.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.120]   The reason why people go to business school
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.680]   after a few years of working
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.320]   is because you want to collect that type of actual work,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.720]   experience and knowledge,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.520]   so that you can feed off of your classmates, teach them.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   And the great thing is you can go in with one thing
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.000]   that you think you're going to come out with.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.840]   You can think that you want to be the marketing executive
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.680]   because that was your former job,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.640]   but from the exposure, the classmates, the classes,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.320]   the types of projects you do,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.240]   that may start shifting and forming your experience
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.760]   into what you actually want to do.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   So to answer your question,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.800]   I went in with a little bit more of the near term,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.400]   the kind of three to five years.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.280]   I want to come out working in this space
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.200]   a little bit closer to product,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.040]   with of course the long-term aspiration
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.720]   of getting to that executive level,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.760]   but leaving the door open
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.960]   as to exactly what type of role that is and how I get there.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.440]   We talked about consulting in a sec, right?
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.320]   Or a little bit earlier.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.920]   A lot of business school MBAs come out as consultants
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   because we are still exploring
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.400]   exactly what that shape looks like.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.800]   And not only is consulting good for early career,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   a lot of people pick it up because we joke,
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.920]   you probably don't know exactly what you want to do
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.320]   even after business school.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   And it's another way to help understand yourself
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.240]   and what you're passionate about.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.320]   - Is there advice you would give to someone
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.600]   who's currently going through business school right now?
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.640]   And there's like one thing they should do or focus on
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.120]   to make sure they arrive at an end state
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.200]   where they can actually do something about it?
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.120]   Like what piece of advice would you give them?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.760]   - Yeah, I would say business school
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.880]   is one of the only times in your life
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.240]   where you can take protected risks.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880]   So try the thing that you didn't think
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.960]   you would be interested in,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.200]   or that you didn't think would match
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.120]   whatever it is that you're thinking,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.320]   your personality, the thing that you want to do,
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.840]   because you are in this two year timeframe
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   where it doesn't actually affect your performance reviews.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.920]   The trials and tribulations you go through
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.200]   with your classmates are relationship building
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.480]   and bonding events.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.040]   I would say take those experiential type classes
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.240]   where you get to go out into the field, into the industry.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.120]   Try something like venture capital.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.840]   We had a VC class where I'm a marketer,
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   taking a VC class.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   Didn't know what I was doing,
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.080]   but because you were in this protected environment
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.120]   of business school, you were there to learn,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.560]   you were there to observe,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.080]   and hopefully that can help shape this two year journey
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.560]   of what you want to exit with.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   - All right, so you decide.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.880]   Product marketing is for you.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.080]   - I'm the marketing. - For you.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.200]   Prior to going to LinkedIn,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.400]   what was your impression of what that job was about?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.240]   - Yeah.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.600]   - And then what was it really about
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.400]   when you started at LinkedIn?
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.960]   Was it, did it meet all your expectations?
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.160]   Was it a little different than expected?
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.360]   Walk us through that a little bit.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.240]   - Yeah, so product marketing was not a job
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.000]   or a term that was on my radar
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.200]   when I was going to business school.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.000]   Actually working in consulting
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.360]   and specifically brand strategy consulting,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.640]   the tech industry, of course I'm a consumer of tech,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.760]   but thinking about what it means to work
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.520]   at one of these companies was also not really on my radar.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.360]   A lot of these come through explorations,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.800]   case studies, competitions we do in business school.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.120]   So your question of what is product marketing,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.560]   was it exactly what I was thinking?
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.880]   I think the answer is actually,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.120]   yes, it is much closer to what I had been doing
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.000]   than what peers or the industry
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.760]   or even people interviewing me would have suggested, right?
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.800]   I think the thing you'll see
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.360]   by transitioning different career role themes
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.400]   is that there is a lot more overlap.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.280]   So product marketing as how I think about it,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.680]   especially in enterprise B2B as LinkedIn is,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.880]   is this intersection between the sales
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.360]   and the go-to-market side
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.520]   and then the R&D and the product side.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.200]   The product marketer sits in between that Venn diagram
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.080]   and tries to take the information, the needs,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.400]   the pain points from our actual customers, our sales team,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.480]   feeds it into product,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.840]   what we call inbound product marketing.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.440]   How can we give them the right information
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.360]   to help sequence and stack the roadmap correctly
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.640]   so that the products that come out
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.600]   are actually meeting those customer needs
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.560]   and that folks actually wanna buy it.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.840]   So that's the outbound side,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   doing the messaging, positioning,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.600]   go-to-market for those products.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.560]   You asked about LinkedIn and LinkedIn, absolutely.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.480]   It was a great place to see that come to life, right?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.400]   LinkedIn has a very, very strong sales side,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.560]   has a very strong R&D side.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.640]   And to be able to sit in the middle
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.960]   was a really good opportunity
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.720]   to not only learn from both of those sides,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.280]   but to figure out what's the best way
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.520]   to put those two together.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.040]   Traditionally, product or R&D and sales
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.640]   don't talk with each other as much.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.680]   And at LinkedIn, what we try to do
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.200]   and what we try to carve out in this,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.040]   you mentioned we were kind of
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.520]   a startup environment in LinkedIn.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.200]   How can we make product marketing,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.720]   how can we be marketing that center
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.120]   that can bridge the information
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   that flows between development and go-to-market?
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.720]   - What would you say is your high point
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.480]   at an experience like LinkedIn
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.600]   versus a low point, right?
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.720]   Or was it pretty, relatively steady
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.320]   for you in that experience?
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.480]   - Yeah, Tim, you must remember
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.520]   when we were at LinkedIn,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.760]   we were, as you mentioned actually in the beginning,
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.080]   trying to transition the acquired company, Linda,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.440]   into the brand new LinkedIn Learning.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.400]   That came with a lot of excitement,
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.320]   which was how can we take all of the good
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.600]   that was Linda and make it even better
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.400]   with a new platform?
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.920]   But at the same time,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.360]   how do we make sure that customers
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.280]   who are so used to and loved linda.com
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   don't hate the new thing
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.280]   because no one likes change?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   So in answering your question,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.560]   I think the most challenging part,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.400]   let me start with that,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.520]   is maintaining that customer love
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.960]   from one thing to the next.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.440]   Change is always hard.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.800]   And if there are any LinkedIn folks
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   watching this recording,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.720]   we did that migration project.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.200]   And that migration project was incredibly difficult
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.120]   because it is more about risk reduction
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.360]   at first before you can go make people
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.040]   love this brand new thing.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.000]   Change is hard.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.720]   Whenever someone changes anything
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.840]   in your favorite product,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.720]   whether it's the color of a button
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.680]   to how the entire thing runs,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.600]   I'm sure most people have this visceral,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.840]   like, "I hate this.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.720]   "Why did you change the thing I love?"
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.040]   Feeling first.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.080]   And then as you start using it,
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.160]   you start seeing why the people
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.160]   who made those decisions love it.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.880]   So making sure the customers actually
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.160]   would continue to be customers
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.560]   was probably one of the most challenging things.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.040]   And then the parts that I love the most
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.640]   was perhaps interacting
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.600]   with all the different types of people
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.760]   with the sales team and seeing
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.600]   what they're talking about
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   and forming relationships with them
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.640]   to make the product better
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.360]   and forming a relationship with the product team.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.080]   And then, of course, getting to talk
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.000]   to customers ourselves directly
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.640]   and getting their opinions and inputs.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.720]   I think that aggregation
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.600]   is what makes you feel a lot closer
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.120]   to the work you're doing.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.760]   And honestly, the thing I was looking for
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.040]   coming out of consulting.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.640]   - Yeah, you know, I remember that migration project.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.120]   That was tough, man.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.960]   (laughing)
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.680]   - Two plus years.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.160]   - Yeah, that was rough.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.400]   And I've always appreciated your approach specifically
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.600]   'cause I know how stressful it is.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.480]   And you managed to still put on
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.840]   a really friendly demeanor.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.280]   Like, you really powered through it.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.840]   And I think the team benefited from that.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.200]   And naturally, when I discovered
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.400]   that you were thinking about leaving,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.480]   like, it hit me hard, man.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   But I'm more interested.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.240]   It's like, as you're going through that,
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.040]   what were you learning about yourself?
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.600]   Whether it's about your own capability
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.480]   or desired rooms to grow
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.720]   that made you even think about
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.880]   exploring something else?
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.520]   'Cause LinkedIn as a company
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.080]   is known for having great culture, right?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.480]   And if you have the desire to grow,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.120]   like, you can make a lot of it.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.480]   And so I would have thought that you'd be
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.880]   the typical person who would go up
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.520]   really high within LinkedIn.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.960]   So all that came as a shock to me.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.840]   So like, what did you learn about yourself
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.120]   and what kind of led you to start thinking about
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.840]   maybe pursuing a different option?
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.600]   LinkedIn is fantastic.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.560]   It's a fantastic company.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.760]   The people are great.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.640]   I remember one of our values is relationships matter, right?
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.120]   And the fact that we are talking here seven years later
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.720]   means that relationships really do matter.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.760]   We built them and we've kept them.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.160]   Some of my closest friends are from LinkedIn
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.080]   and we still keep in touch today.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.960]   So the thinking that I had was,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.680]   what did I learn at LinkedIn?
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.360]   What was I good at and wanted to double down on?
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.760]   And what did I not see in my role
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.120]   that I wanted to explore elsewhere?
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.440]   I think the thing that I've started seeing
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.400]   and observing about product marketing as a function
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.560]   is that each company defines product marketing,
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.480]   the role, the responsibility,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.160]   and how you're measured for success very differently.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.080]   I mentioned a little bit outbound product marketing.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   So the more go-to-market side
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.920]   where you're doing the messaging, the positioning,
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.960]   and then the inbound product marketing,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.760]   which is more about feature development,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.320]   working with the R&D side.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.000]   I have always gravitated a little bit more
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.560]   to the inbound side.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.040]   Now, I picked product marketing as a career
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.680]   because I was very good at the outbound side.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.640]   It was a lot of what I did in my brand consulting role,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.200]   figuring out how to take something,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.120]   put the right narrative and story around it,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.600]   and take it to market for customers
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.200]   that resonate with them, right?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.400]   And I really wanted to learn more about the inbound side,
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.760]   which is creating, building, ideating
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.480]   about what the different ways of product
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.320]   in the future can come to life.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.600]   And at LinkedIn, I got to see both sides of it,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.640]   but I think the thing that I was missing
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.920]   was working a little bit more closely
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.400]   with the product management side.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.320]   I wanted to work with them to figure out
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.120]   what features should be coming out,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.680]   working with design to figure out
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.760]   how the thing should look like.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.800]   And that was part of my desire to look elsewhere
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.960]   is because I had this vision
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.320]   of what product marketing could be,
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.840]   how to become a successful product marketer.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.280]   And when I made the transition out,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.960]   it's because I got a call to say,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.240]   "Hey, can you come to this company
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.400]   "to help us define what product marketing could be
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.640]   "and could look like?"
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.240]   And I saw that as an opportunity not to go,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.200]   not only to go to a new company,
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.880]   work on something very, very exciting.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.200]   The company was Slack.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.640]   But also be able to help define at an earlier stage
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.160]   what product marketing as a function could be.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   - Yeah, you're calling out something
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.360]   which is really important,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.720]   which I'm really glad you went through that thought process
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.680]   'cause a lot of times when you hear people making pivots,
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   they're disgruntled or something.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.360]   And so when the opportunity comes to them,
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.840]   they'll grab the opportunity
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.400]   'cause it's opportunity to parachute out
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.360]   and land somewhere else.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.120]   And oftentimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.160]   I can definitely tell you the grass is never greener.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   It's always gonna be shades of brown,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.320]   but the patches of green are just in different places.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.040]   And for me, I don't know actually
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.120]   if I've ever told you this, Michael,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.200]   like LinkedIn for me, my role was also really healthy.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.360]   It was really good.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.560]   And when I was thinking about where I wanna advance
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.800]   in my career,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.400]   I wanted to be very intentional about my decisions
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.880]   because leaving a safe space like LinkedIn,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.960]   it's a tough decision, right?
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.920]   'Cause there's a lot of stability there at the time.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.200]   Today, the job market is different.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.480]   That statement is totally quickly outdated.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.100]   Like what is stability anymore?
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.960]   But like you, I kind of went through my checklist
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.120]   of what I wanted to do in my career.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.960]   And while you were,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.920]   your equivalent is like kind of getting closer to product
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.360]   and kind of getting and influencing that, the roadmap.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.520]   For me, my version was, you know,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.440]   'cause I'm older than you,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.920]   although maybe, hopefully I look young.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.760]   - Can't see, can't see.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.580]   - Can't see.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.920]   - I just can't do any of this.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.560]   - This beard added like five years to my age.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   I think at that point, for me, I was like, you know what?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.960]   I want to not only get back to leading teams,
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.720]   but LinkedIn is known for having such a great culture.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.340]   And I felt like I was a culture contributor,
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.920]   but I wasn't a culture driver.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.160]   And so for me, when I was looking at opportunities to leave,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.200]   that was my very specific lens.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.880]   Like I only would wanna go somewhere
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.560]   where I believe that the culture wasn't a place
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.920]   that was open to change, but maybe needed the right catalyst.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.640]   And so for me, that was how I kind of looked
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.680]   at the next opportunity.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   And then that became my first director role.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.680]   But I think I quickly learned
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.080]   that your position in the company doesn't necessarily imply
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.720]   how much influence you have over it with things like culture.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.360]   And so that was its whole interesting journey.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.440]   And I can get to that another time,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.340]   but again, it was a very intentional decision.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.100]   I think the takeaway for people here is that, you know,
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.680]   as you're looking at making pivots,
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.280]   have a true, honest conversation with yourself
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.840]   about what you're really looking for.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.560]   That allows you to go to interviews
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.760]   with a very specific set of questions
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.000]   that might be eye-opening conversations
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.880]   that the interviewer is not expecting.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.840]   And that in itself can make you stand out.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.400]   Cool, so you teased us with Slack.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.080]   And you kind of talked about the opportunities
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.240]   of presenting yourself there.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.200]   Can you tell us a little bit about like, again,
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.680]   expectations meeting reality?
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.120]   Is that what you thought it was?
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.760]   Grass is greener, grass is the same.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.640]   - Well, so actually, right before I talk about Slack,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.120]   you said something that really clicked with me,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.600]   which was going toward an opportunity
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.120]   instead of running away from something that you don't like.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.600]   Let's talk about that for a second.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.320]   And I'll tap into the risk tolerance part
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.680]   because that is a very big barrier
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.840]   even before I decided to go interview somewhere else, right?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   - Yeah, okay, yeah.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.500]   - Let's talk about a few things
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.920]   and then let's talk about Slack after.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.160]   The first one, and I actually would be very curious
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.760]   to how you thought about this as well
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.960]   in your own transitions.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.520]   The running toward an opportunity piece
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.120]   is something that I've heard a lot.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.280]   Don't leave your job because you are fed up with it.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.200]   You're frustrated because then you've limited
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   your scope and visibility into what the next thing is.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.320]   You will probably reduce the number of opportunities
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.400]   because you're just trying to get away from something
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.560]   if you're able to, right?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.200]   And I say this because not everyone has the ability
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.600]   to not exit or hold on.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.620]   But if you're able to not run away
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.480]   and see those opportunities that excite you,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.680]   I think one, it helps you stay longer at the next job.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.960]   Two, it helps you enjoy it more.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.040]   But it also helps you succeed in the interview
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.380]   and the actual job more because something drew you in
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.280]   that you want to build more on.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.160]   And building something, not just features and products,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.600]   but building your own skillset, personality,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.920]   your own journey, and that is just done that much better
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.880]   if you're going toward instead of away.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.040]   But Tim, how did you think about it
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.440]   and how did you also approach the risk equation?
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.280]   Because LinkedIn is a fantastic company, still is,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.920]   and it's hard to leave a known for an unknown.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.400]   And I'm curious how you decided then,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.800]   and then let's talk about Slack afterwards.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.280]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.360]   And actually, there's another experience
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.960]   from earlier in my career where I absolutely ran away
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.320]   from something like you described,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.380]   and it totally, I flamed out from that decision.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.520]   For LinkedIn, because I wanted to see
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.600]   if I could shape culture, I had to spend some time
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.520]   thinking about what culture meant to me, right?
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.320]   'Cause again, when you talk about culture,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.760]   it seems like a very soft thing.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.600]   LinkedIn was actually the only place I've ever seen
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.400]   where they operationalized it by metric
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.440]   and measured it by success,
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.880]   and it held people accountable
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.920]   at all levels of organization.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.640]   So for me, I wanted to see if I could replicate that.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.660]   And so when I'm looking at other companies
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.520]   that have a certain executive structure,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.760]   a lot of it was understanding
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.220]   what's my future VP's point of view on culture
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.680]   and what their tolerance was.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.200]   I also had an aspect where I wanna learn
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.720]   how to grow my abilities to lead larger teams.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.120]   And so I had a little checklist.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   It went really granular from my abilities to mentor,
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.120]   my good as I thought it was.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.800]   So there was a hypothesis that I had about myself.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.360]   My ability to take culture, influence my team
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.880]   and develop people was always a passion of mine.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.140]   Learning how I can shape the future of technology investment
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.520]   was another kind of interest area of mine.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.000]   And so when I was interviewing there,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.480]   I found out that they're still on WordPress.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.520]   Oh, there's an opportunity to maybe re-platform.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.440]   So there's a potential there
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.000]   to do something really, really big.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.900]   I think a lot of it is just other areas to cut my teeth.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:04.320]   At LinkedIn, I had budgets, but I never influenced budget,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.160]   nor was I held accountable to pipeline.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.600]   And that's an area that always kind of freaked me out.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.400]   And so I wanted, without the safety of business school,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   I wanted to take the risk and expose myself
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.240]   and see if I can do that.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.800]   And hopefully it would have worked out better than worse.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.640]   Thankfully, I wasn't exposed for being a fraud.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.480]   Thankfully, I did a good job.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.920]   I mean, those are the kinds of things where like,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.600]   those are responsibilities that I never had before
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.520]   that enticed me that would have projected myself.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.440]   How about for you?
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.600]   - Yeah, it's real, right?
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.560]   I mean, you mentioned being a fraud.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.280]   Imposter syndrome is a very real thing.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.640]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.000]   - The fear of not knowing what that next job may look like,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.360]   whether it's just a new company
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   or taking a completely different role,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.800]   that risk is probably the biggest barrier for myself.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.040]   And I'm sure for a lot of folks that we know
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.440]   to even consider making a change.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.480]   There was one,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.080]   learned a lot of great things in business school.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.960]   There's one professor that said,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.520]   if you're going into your next job
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.400]   and you feel like you already know how to do 80% of the job,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.840]   then it's too junior of a role for you.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.200]   He said something in the percentage,
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.520]   it can of course vary by person,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.240]   but he's like, you should only know maybe 40%
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.360]   of how to do the job,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.240]   because you also want to continue growing
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.040]   and learning from that job.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.520]   - Wow, that's deep.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.080]   - Yeah, and again, one of the,
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.400]   it's easier to say than it is to actually do,
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   but imposter syndrome is real for everyone, for all of us,
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.880]   but the spirit of learning and observing
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.360]   how other people around you do it,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.800]   you will always be surrounded
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.680]   by people who can teach you something.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.840]   And to your point about culture,
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.560]   if you're in a company that has that mentality,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.920]   then you can become the person that you know you can be,
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.480]   that you wanted to be in joining that company
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.320]   and grow your way into it.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.160]   So taking a risk is obviously hard, that's why it's a risk.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.800]   But if you can imagine and foresee yourself in that role,
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.400]   I think that's what can help generate the confidence
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.600]   for you to even consider taking that leap
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.040]   and then actually getting there.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.240]   - Yeah, that's, oh man, that statement about
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.920]   if you already know 80% of the job is too junior for you,
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.960]   that is fascinating, 'cause talking about risk,
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.760]   there's a piece of it which is like going,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.960]   staying within a realm of your comfort zone, right,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.880]   and still advancing your career.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.760]   Now, if you're, let's say you do the 40% role
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.960]   where like you're only 40% knowledgeable,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   but you know enough to be dangerous to cover the other 60,
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.680]   the challenge there is,
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.840]   as you're moving into a senior leadership team,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.920]   your dependency on your team is then more important.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.440]   So is the incumbent team positioned in a way
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.280]   to allow you to succeed?
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.680]   And in today's economy market,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.480]   it's hard to find the headcount
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.880]   if there's no budget either, right?
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   So like there's so many things you need to take
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.160]   into consideration, like can I get the most out of my team?
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.040]   Are they high-performing?
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   Are there opportunities for improvement or managing out?
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.680]   But if I were to manage out,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.120]   would I even get the backfill?
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.880]   If the answer is no,
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.320]   then you need to rethink the whole strategy, right?
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.360]   It's about development or shifting,
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.800]   helping people shift careers.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   But yeah, that risk piece there is really high for,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.040]   you know, as you get up the chain for, you know,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.160]   responsibility.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.800]   - Yeah, and I'm gonna go on one more tangent,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.000]   but I think it's relevant.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   So this is from a me looking for a job standpoint, right?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.080]   I've also built teams and hired them.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.280]   And I think it's a similar type of philosophy
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.240]   and mentality in hiring teams.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.840]   Of course, it's easier to hire someone
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   who has the title on their resume,
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.080]   because you know that they've done something similar
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   for that job, right?
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   Less they have to learn,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.320]   they're probably at that 80% mark threshold,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.920]   so they can come into the company,
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.880]   figure it out and just start running in the first few weeks.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.560]   But what I've actually learned
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.400]   and where I've found some of my most successful hires
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.920]   were people who did not have that same job title,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.040]   but you recognize transferable skills and talent.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.240]   If you see someone who has potential and has built a story,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.520]   and you see that they are capable and eager to learn,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.840]   that person can grow into something
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.760]   that could be much greater and do make more impact
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.920]   than that person who's been doing it for a little bit,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.760]   for their past job already, right?
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.160]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.120]   It's like, do they have that proverbial growth mindset,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.240]   right?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.440]   Do they have the curiosity to learn?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.400]   And then for you, it's up to the manager
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.720]   to kind of uncork that a little bit and let it all out,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.600]   'cause they may not have had the opportunity
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   to really fully explore.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.000]   I actually really enjoy that part of management.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.320]   - Yeah, it's much easier to teach a hard skill.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.800]   Actually, you tell me about your roles as well.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.440]   I feel like it's easier to teach someone
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.720]   how to create a great slide deck or some technical skill
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.080]   than it is to teach someone how to be curious
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.240]   or how to develop good relationships
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.720]   with your sales partner or your design partner.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.840]   If you see someone with the soft skill ability
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.200]   who has the potential to learn and build,
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.400]   I think as a manager, as a leader,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.160]   you can mold and shape that person or that team
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.960]   into a direction that helps them
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.400]   and also helps the company.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.600]   - Yeah, no, in every individual that I've ever mentored,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.280]   there is a process that I go through,
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.080]   and it's the first one.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.880]   If you're watching this, you've been through this with me,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.720]   you're probably chuckling right now,
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.160]   'cause I don't even know what to call this thing.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.920]   I need to brand it.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   Basically, it's like understanding what, as a human,
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.360]   what gives you joy,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.840]   understanding what are your values
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.120]   that you can't negotiate on,
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.760]   and then what the next two to three years looks like.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.040]   And the reason why that applies to your conversation
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.440]   and uncovering growth mindset or potential to learn
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   is every individual is different.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.000]   So as a manager, you need to understand
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.040]   exactly how your team is wired and what makes them happy.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.480]   'Cause some people, just getting acknowledgment is joy.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.320]   Some people don't want an acknowledgment.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.760]   And for them, it's something else.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.600]   And some people, it's more around being around people,
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.240]   whereas other people are around joy
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.840]   from getting a task completed.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.720]   So understanding how they're wired,
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.440]   then tying into what their core values are.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.400]   So for me, I'm a very people-oriented,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   so respect and accountability is really important for me.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.560]   When you tie respect and accountability
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.400]   with things that give me joy,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   and you package into what I wanna do
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.600]   in three to five years,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.240]   there's a very specific track there I can go on
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.320]   that's tied into hard skills and soft skills.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.440]   So I typically do that.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.240]   I think once you start assuming everyone's kinda like you
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.040]   and you get stuck in mentoring
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.080]   as if you're mentoring yourself,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.400]   then you kind of limit the capability
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.720]   to help people grow at all.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.240]   And these folks bring in so much,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.160]   not so much, but like really good ideas
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.600]   that you may have not even thought about.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.040]   If you as a manager can be learning,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.320]   I think that's one of the best things
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.280]   because you're expanding your knowledge base.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.480]   You're expanding your own potential
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.200]   if you have people that you've hired for your team.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.160]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.760]   I am constantly reminding my team to challenge me.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.440]   And sometimes I'll throw something out there
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.880]   that I'm hoping someone challenges
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   and no one challenges me,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.520]   I'll call everyone out on it.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.440]   I'm like, what I just said made no sense.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.680]   Like, why is everyone nodding their head?
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.080]   - You're playing games in your head.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.600]   - I know, it's like four teachers, yeah.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.520]   But I think that goes to the culture, right?
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.720]   A culture where it's a safe space
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.560]   for people to truly be themselves,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.040]   to feel empowered, to challenge the status quo.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.840]   Like, that's what my management style is all about, right?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.760]   - Cool, so you're at Slack.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.160]   And so, what did you discover about yourself there?
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.120]   And 'cause I'm assuming from there,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   was it from there where you eventually went to product side?
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.280]   - No, so I was still in product marketing at Slack.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.120]   - Okay.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.280]   - Different level and also just a different scope, right?
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.320]   So a lot more on the, well, I'll talk about it.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   I ended up a lot more on the inbound side,
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.960]   but it wasn't an easy journey to get there.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.800]   - Okay.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.280]   - So going to Slack, well, the first thing you notice
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.840]   is LinkedIn is what, it was a 15,000 person company or so,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.080]   even though we were a small group,
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.840]   it's still a massive company.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.960]   Slack was about 800 or so people when I joined.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   And you can feel the energy, momentum, velocity,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.400]   everything being a little different there.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.720]   People are a lot scrappier, as we like to say,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.000]   in the tech world, right?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You have to figure out what, how to do the next thing,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.600]   because that path has not yet been set for you.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.520]   I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.440]   I was brought into Slack is to help define
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.600]   what product marketing as a function
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.400]   could be for the company.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.160]   And I would say it wasn't easy to do that.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.760]   The team at Slack, so I would say product marketing,
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.960]   the core responsibility is to take a product to market.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   You have to market that product.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.840]   And the inbound side, and this is through
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.760]   a lot of reflection and just talking through
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.920]   and working through a lot of different places,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.600]   the inbound side is a nice to have.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.800]   And I believe it's really important
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.920]   because it makes me better at the outbound side.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.080]   If I know why we chose to build a product
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.360]   in the way that we did so,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.040]   the trade-offs that we considered,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.360]   then I can actually craft the narrative for the market
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.280]   that talks about why the value of the final product
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.000]   is what it is and how it comes together.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.160]   But that said, when push comes to shove,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.560]   you have to be a good outbound go-to-market product marketer
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.080]   to succeed in that job.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.280]   Side of that is, well, if you're a PM watching this,
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.640]   you're saying, hey, the inbound side is actually my job.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.560]   I'm the one who should really be deciding
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.760]   how the roadmap is built and sequenced
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.640]   because, well, at the end of the day,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   it is the product manager's core responsibility
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.080]   to set the product strategy, the roadmap,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.520]   and figure out how a product comes to life.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.080]   And the reason I give that context is as a PMM at Slack,
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.160]   trying to say, hey, every PMM should have that inbound role
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   was first met with a lot of resistance.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.440]   It felt like stepping on toes, right?
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.840]   Why are you taking this part of my job
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.240]   as opposed to you can help me do my job better
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.080]   and add different perspectives
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.840]   that I may not have considered yet?
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.720]   Very fair perspective to hold, right?
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.120]   If you are used to doing it one way
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.200]   and someone comes in and says,
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.080]   no, you got to do your job differently,
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.560]   your first reaction is going to be, no, I don't.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.160]   I already know what I'm doing.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.640]   And what value are you going to add?
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.320]   And I think it's that last question,
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.200]   what value are you going to add
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.720]   that really helped me break through
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.240]   and form that partnership with the product team,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.720]   just as we did at LinkedIn Form8 with the sales team
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.840]   that helped me shape this kind of,
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.120]   we'll call it a full stack
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.680]   or both inbound and outbound product marketer.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.520]   - Can you give me an example
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.480]   of how you kind of broke through that wall
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.040]   and came to that ultimate realization
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.640]   and alignment with your teams?
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.800]   It took some time.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.440]   And I think it took relationship building.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.800]   It took bringing the right pieces of information
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.360]   such as data that you were able to collect,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.200]   research that we as marketers tend to do,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.320]   user experience research or some quantitative research.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.680]   And it also took a success story
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.640]   to actually make it come to life.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.720]   It's hard, it's hard to do.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.280]   So a few of those things,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.640]   I think getting to know some of those product managers
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.440]   or the R&D side, what they're looking for,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.040]   where their gaps, not in terms of what they can do,
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.800]   but in terms of what time they have,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.360]   how can you help add some value,
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.320]   filling in more sales stories or VOCs,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   voice of customers, for example, is one.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.600]   Building those relationships, giving them that data,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.880]   how many customers of what size of what revenue
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.760]   are saying they need X versus Y
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.320]   and helping them think through that trade-off decision
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.280]   was really helpful and important.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.000]   And lastly, not just talking,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.880]   showing how that partnership
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   can actually make a product better
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.720]   and how the design as well as the go-to-market is better
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.080]   with that kind of embedded PMM
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.200]   was what helped me create that kind of relationship
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.720]   within Slack.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.640]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.720]   I mean, you're talking about
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.240]   the art of building credibility, right?
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.080]   And I think you're totally right.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.560]   If you don't spend time in their shoe
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.320]   understanding what they're responsible for
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.560]   and what they're going to be measured by,
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.680]   then naturally they're gonna take a defensive stance, right?
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.760]   'Cause you're gonna make a decision
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.400]   that could impact their livelihood,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.080]   their responsibility or scope.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.480]   But like, yeah, I like how you're data-driven,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.840]   results-driven approach to kind of help them understand,
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.000]   first of all, that you understand
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.520]   what they're trying to solve for
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.720]   and how you actually add value to that is important.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.360]   And I think the better storyteller you are
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.640]   in helping them understand the ultimate vision
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.160]   and how this thing works together
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.960]   is really, really important.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.040]   More often than not, people are not good storytellers
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.360]   and they come in with a very focused lens
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.000]   and it's not clear why it matters or why you should care,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.800]   then becomes very confrontational.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.440]   And those are the mistakes I made very early on in my career
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.000]   coming in with a lot of passion and a lot of fire
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.680]   and ambition and just bull in a China shop.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.520]   - Yeah.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.840]   - You don't want to be that guy.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.760]   - It's, you said it perfectly, it's the empathy.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.640]   It's being in their shoes.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.440]   I mean, hey, we're talking about
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.920]   what it looks like to transition careers.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.640]   It's a very similar mentality
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.000]   as building a product for the market, right?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.520]   You have to know the customer,
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.800]   you have to know what their pains are
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.360]   and you have to know how to make it better
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.920]   and be able to craft that story, that narrative
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.360]   and help them see why your vision, idea, product,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.520]   anything can make their lives better.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.080]   You can't assume that a customer
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.960]   is going to buy your feature of your product.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.640]   You can't assume that a partner at work
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.720]   will want to work with you.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.440]   But if you know what it is that they're trying to get to,
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.320]   then I think at the very least carves the path
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.400]   that you can take to get to that destination.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.840]   - So with this journey,
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.080]   starting from where we started this conversation,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.040]   you're moving closer and closer and closer to the customer.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.960]   You're moving closer and closer and closer
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.000]   to product and roadmap.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.720]   So was this the juncture where you're like,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.240]   hey, marketing versus product,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:56.240]   was that the decision point or did it happen after Slack?
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   - Yeah, so that question started
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.160]   maybe even when I applied to business school
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.600]   and went through it.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.920]   And LinkedIn and Slack were both experiences
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.280]   in building up the marketing background that I had
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.840]   because I was interested in it
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.720]   and because I wasn't yet ready
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.040]   or it felt like too big of a risk
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.480]   to jump from what I've known
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.520]   and have been very good at for the past 10 or so years
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.840]   at this point into what I thought was a completely new field.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.080]   To answer your question,
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.360]   I took one more detour
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.440]   before I went into product management.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.040]   And it was another one of those go-toward experiences
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.320]   where now that I have done product marketing,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.000]   now that I had done brand and consulting,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.720]   what could it look like to actually run marketing
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.400]   for a whole company?
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.320]   And I decided to take that leap,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.560]   a very, very scary leap,
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.400]   because marketing, as you know, Tim,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.960]   you do a part of marketing
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.520]   that I would never be able to do, right?
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.320]   And as we know, marketing is so broad
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.600]   from demand generation to web strategy
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.120]   to product marketing, brand strategy,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.960]   content generation, social,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.800]   so much happens in marketing.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.560]   And to lead a marketing team was super exciting,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.760]   to be able to build out what you think
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.120]   all of those functions should be able to do
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.840]   and then create the holistic impact
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.440]   of how that story gets told to market.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.080]   So I took a little detour there
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.440]   trying to learn about everything marketing
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.320]   before I then committed to,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.880]   I actually am interested in the product
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.320]   and the development side,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.240]   and made a switch, actually,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.400]   from being pretty high up in marketing
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.680]   to learning how to become a product manager.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.400]   - So that's interesting.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.160]   So you're kind of starting at the high
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.400]   where you've hit that final, that pinnacle point.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.080]   How long into that experience
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   did you have the realization?
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   It's like, you know what?
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.920]   This isn't for me.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.040]   'Cause it's a very big decision
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.200]   and impacts a lot of people.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.040]   So what did that look like for you?
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   - Yeah, it's wild emotions fluctuating up and down, right?
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.600]   So it wasn't easy to come to that realization
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.720]   because of, well, a few things, right?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.760]   Risk, not only what does it look like to switch jobs,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.720]   but when you're at a certain point in your career,
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.480]   the opportunity cost of switching is much higher.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.200]   And I think that just becomes another dimension
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.160]   in transitioning.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.920]   I think, so a few things, right?
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.440]   One is the passion.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.120]   What gives me, what gives you energy
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.160]   to want to do that next thing?
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.400]   What makes you wanna leave something on one day
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.440]   and then pick it right back up the next day?
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.680]   And for me, so much of my impetus
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.800]   for going to business school,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.960]   for going into product marketing and tech
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.160]   was to be close to the product.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.000]   I love designing, working with the R&D side
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.880]   to see and figure out how should your product roadmap
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   and strategy feel.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.160]   And when you're taking on everything in marketing,
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   well, the product marketing side is such a small sliver.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.080]   And depending on the stage of company you're at,
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.160]   your attention may have to be completely,
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.480]   somewhere completely different.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.640]   Brand building was one of them.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   Loved it, different than product.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.040]   And I also needed to generate pipeline,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.120]   which was quite frankly a skillset
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.880]   that I hadn't built in to product marketing.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.600]   And it was that frantic learning and trying to figure out
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.480]   how do you build demand generation program
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.000]   with the marketing ops and systems and technology
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.080]   to feed into it.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.640]   It was a very exciting
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.480]   and also a very humbling experience for me
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.320]   to know what I could do and was good at,
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.760]   to learn what I didn't know how to do
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.200]   and figure out how to plug those gaps,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.960]   either through hiring or learning it myself.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.280]   And then ultimately that realization of,
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.680]   hey, maybe product was the direction I wanted to go in
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.880]   versus higher up in marketing.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.000]   - So when you made the leap to product,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.880]   my fear is always like, okay,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.760]   getting close to the product
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.160]   means your technical competency has to,
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.480]   the bar just got raised, right?
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.000]   And so how much would that,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.120]   coming into, I'm assuming Asana's the next one,
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.040]   how much of that was on-the-job learning
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.160]   versus education or preparedness prior to Asana
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.720]   that from a technology point of view,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.240]   like how'd you make that leap?
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.560]   Was it a painful transition?
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.960]   What did that look like for you?
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:30.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.640]   So lots of learning, absolutely.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.840]   By no means that I come in
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.080]   and was able to become a fantastic product manager,
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.760]   but I was able to come in hitting the ground running
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.880]   for a few different reasons.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.200]   One of which was I know the subject matter very well.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.840]   Having spent time building our learning platform at LinkedIn,
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.320]   having worked on Slack as a collaboration software,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.120]   Asana and the workflow space that I work in
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.800]   is very familiar with me.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.600]   One of the biggest things that carry in,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.000]   and we kind of touched upon this theme
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   is knowing your customer.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.120]   And I had carried in a lot of research and knowledge
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.440]   about what this customer profile looks like,
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.280]   what the market of buying profile looks like
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.320]   that I can bring in actually as a different
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.840]   and new perspective as a PM, as a product manager
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.960]   and carve out a different shape of what it looks like.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.680]   That's one part of it.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.960]   The second, as you mentioned that the technical chops of it,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   I would say you probably know more
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.760]   than you think you know, right?
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.480]   If you are working at that company,
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   if you are a consumer of technology,
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.320]   you generally know how things may interact with each other
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.400]   and the technical pieces of being a PM is just,
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.920]   well, it's several layers deeper,
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.440]   but knowing how various aspects of the product relate,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   depend, work with each other,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.800]   and then figuring out, hey, technically, is this feasible?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.040]   Does it cost more to do X versus Y?
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.760]   And just really understanding
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.960]   how the puzzle as a whole fits together
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:10.040]   is my kind of translation of the technical components,
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   but having good tech partners.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.560]   So I have a fantastic tech lead on the team
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   and we are always bouncing ideas
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.840]   off of each other and learning from each other.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.320]   I always run an idea.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.760]   Hey, if I have this brand new idea for a feature,
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.320]   let's talk about what it might cost us
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.520]   because we have either never built this thing in the past
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.880]   or we can leverage some existing frameworks
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.160]   and foundations that we can tap into.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.800]   So I am always learning from my peers
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.360]   to give me enough of that technical knowledge,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.880]   making me, as we like to say, dangerous enough
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   in these tech conversations to be good at my job.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.400]   - So now that you're in seat doing PM,
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.800]   what's maybe the top two things that are always on your mind
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.360]   as a practicing product manager?
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.040]   - Oh yeah, two things on my mind.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.320]   So I think the first thing is the customer.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.160]   It's absolutely the customer, but when you say customer,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.480]   we know that not every customer looks the same.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.400]   And actually, quite frankly, the segmentations
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.560]   and the different profiles and the different usage profiles,
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.440]   the buying profiles for enterprise tech are all so different.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.560]   How do you figure out how to sequence
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.160]   and see and prioritize what is the most important thing
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.000]   to do?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.240]   One example is voice of customer, right?
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.440]   These are current customers who have used your product
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.040]   and said, these are the great parts of it.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.520]   And then these are the pieces that I need you to fix.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.280]   And that ladder is probably a lot much larger list
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.440]   than the floor.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.400]   So you got to figure out, okay,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.840]   when do I build the incremental product improvements
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.280]   versus taking a whole net new idea
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.400]   that you think may help differentiate your product
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.320]   or your company and try to take that kind of a bet
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.240]   and build something big.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   So the first thing on my mind is always
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.200]   what does the market, what's the market telling me?
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.040]   What are my customers telling me
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.080]   about what they want next?
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.000]   And then the second part is making decisions
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.480]   at both the micro level of not just,
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.960]   here's the holistic product you're building,
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.760]   but how does every single user story feature stack up
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.200]   and in what order you want to build it in
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.640]   to continuously add value
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.120]   and making sure that the rest of your company,
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.560]   be it the product leadership level or the sales side,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.040]   get on board and understand,
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.000]   and actually lastly, be able to recite that back
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.840]   to the market.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.800]   You need that kind of consistency
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.480]   and support throughout your organization
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.840]   for your holistic product strategy to actually take flight.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.000]   - Well, I mean, none of that surprises me
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.360]   in terms of like your thoroughness
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.440]   'cause I've been a long time Asana user.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.200]   And so knowing like there's someone like you at the helm,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.120]   you know, like in your respective area leading it,
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.960]   like it all makes sense to me
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.160]   'cause I know you and I had such a great product experience.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.720]   Michael, I just want to thank you for your time here.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.200]   I would love to have you come back sometime
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.480]   if you want to talk about something else,
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.960]   but this was really enjoyable.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.680]   - Absolutely, so good to see you, Tim.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.320]   Great to hear that you're an Asana user
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.680]   and it was really good to connect again in this.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.960]   - Cool, thanks, Michael.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.120]   - Yeah, thanks, Tim.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.780]   you
