[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   My small family spent two years of our lives essentially stateless.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Stranded at sea, 18,000 kilometers from home, floating on 40 feet of fiberglass.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Freedom to transact literally became a matter of life or death.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   This is our story.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Australia locked its citizens out from returning during the pandemic.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   My family, wife and three kids, three, five, and six months old, were sailing on a catamaran in the eastern Caribbean at the time.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We ended up there for two years, waiting out the pandemic.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   When the pandemic hit, we essentially became stateless.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   For a time, all countries within sailing distance closed their borders to Australian flagged vessels.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   No flights or cruise ships.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   My son couldn't renew his passport, and we had to get him temporary refugee papers.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Initially, we got locked down for 91 days on our boat in an overseas territory of France.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The Gendarme Nautique, water police, prohibited us from leaving the boat.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We technically weren't even allowed to swim off the boat at anchor.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Early on, desperate to get the kids some exercise, we took the dinghy to an isolated beach.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The Gendarme came with guns and megaphones to enforce our isolation.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The next day, a mini aircraft carrier arrived and military control was implemented on the island.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Hurricane season arrived while we were still in lockdown, ramping up the stress.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We provisioned to head to sea if a hurricane approached.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Stateless, the last resort plan was to drift at sea, waiting out the season.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I studied the weather manically.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Months passed. Hurricanes became imminent. The outlook dire.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Then Grenada saved us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   They let 1,200 stranded boats in despite their borders being completely shut.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   A tiny, poor country was saving us when my own affluent country was blocking its citizens.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   This hit home hard.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We sailed three days nonstop to Grenada.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Too late in the season, we faced terrible weather, experiencing multiple frontal systems, winds of 30 to 40 plus knots.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And at one point, three tornadic water spouts closed in around us while the gooseneck bolt on the boom vibrated loose.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Two more weeks of quarantine, then freedom after four months restricted to the boat.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   NOAA then issued a hurricane warning with a track map directly over us.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We scrambled to prepare and tied to the mangroves.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Thankfully, it fizzled out and passed just south of us.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   As time went by, we became forgotten citizens.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Freedom to transact issues began to arise.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We had been living in Canada for the three years prior on global expert visas.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Canada had also locked us out.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It remained open to citizens and permanent residents, but not to work visa holders.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Our Canadian bank cards expired, and we needed to be physically in Canada to activate new ones.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Subsequently, our online banking account was suspended for suspicious activity.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Again, we were required to go into a branch to remedy, which was impossible.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Our Australian bank access also became restricted.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   After roaming overseas for too long, our Australian phone SIMs expired,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and we lost access to our two-factor authentication numbers needed for access to our bank accounts there.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   To obtain a new SIM, we needed to provide government-approved ID and activate from within Australia.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Again, the familiar response was, "Come into the bank and we can sort this out."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Loss of freedom of movement essentially led to a loss of freedom to transact.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Fortunately, we had access to family who could help us out,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and the bank agreed, after much pleading over the phone,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   to accept a phone number of a family member for two-factor authentication.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But the lesson was clear.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Without freedom to transact, you have very limited options to sustain life.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The Australian government had placed a Level 4 travel ban on the entire world for its citizens,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   previously reserved only for war zones.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   This immediately rendered both our travel and health insurance policies void
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   due to exemption clauses for travel to Level 4 areas.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   The Panama Canal then shut to vessels under 80 feet,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and so began two often stressful years at sea, 18,000 kilometers from home,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   reliant on the benevolence of small foreign countries to provide the very shelter
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   that our own country refused to render.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   In this crazy chapter of our lives, we faced numerous challenges,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   yet savored incredible family experiences.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Cancelled by the stress, we entered a heightened state of existence,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   ultimately transforming it into the most extraordinary time of our lives.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Navigating through immense technical and geopolitical intricacies,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   we journeyed using little more than wind across 15 countries and territories during the pandemic.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   With the absence of cruise ships and flights,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   the Caribbean's remote tranquility echoed the serenity of the 1950s.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Sailing into endless sunsets, dolphins playfully surfed our bows awake
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   as the stars emerged in the evening sky.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We saw numerous volcanic islands materialize on the horizon
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and explored untouched jungles and secluded waterfalls.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We spent time with the kids, wildlife spotting for monkeys, iguanas, bird colonies,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   exploring volcanic landscapes, relaxing in hot springs,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   swimming and diving over the reef with turtles and schools of fish,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   just enjoying the sea and each other as we watched the kids grow up.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Endless hours at the beach, meeting other stranded families from all over the world
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   with vastly different backgrounds but ultimately a shared story,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   a common experience to bond us together.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   We ran our own renewable power systems, solar and wind, into a lithium bank.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   We made our own water via a small desalination unit,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   caught our own fish, drank rum punch, and watched the green flash
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   from more remote beaches than one could expect to see in tens of lifetimes.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Not all rose is obviously.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The flip side was the challenges of raising a baby girl and two boys,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   including doing homeschool in a confined space.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Coming up to speed under duress as landlubbers with the realities of sailing,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   navigation, weather routing, and all boat systems.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Constantly working on the seemingly infinite list of boat maintenance jobs.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Endless time spent provisioning and looking for parts,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   fitting in the time to work remotely to keep us alive financially.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Dragging anchor in midnight squalls, having other boats drag around you.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Enduring sleep deprivation from anchor alarms and a breastfeeding infant,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   we somehow persevered on multi-day sails without access to additional crew,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   testing our limits.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We then faced extended lockdowns and quarantines everywhere upon arrival.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   The mental angst of that initial 91 days of lockdown in the hurricane belt,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   hoping that borders would open somewhere for Australian flagged vessels
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   before the hurricane season started, be with me for life.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Certainly the hardest thing we have done as a family.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   The 18 months that followed was a sublimely beautiful,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   yet at times crushingly difficult.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   In hindsight, the most meaningful time in our lives.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   When we finally made it home to Australia after two years floating on 40 feet of fiberglass,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   it felt like an alternate reality.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   People at home stressing about the smallest of issues and arguing over trivial things.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The Australia I left, a nation of prolific travelers,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   was now scared of foreigners in a way I had never thought possible in my life.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Something had been lost in the population here.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   They had their own lockdown trauma.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   In a bizarre way, being stranded at sea liberated us from it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Forged by circumstance, intermeshed into the physical world around us,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   our preconceived boundaries of what was possible in life,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   physically and emotionally, had been removed.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Yet in other ways, it led to a kind of PTSD reintegrating into society.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Everyone took for granted simple freedoms like freedom of movement,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   freedom to always be able to return to your home country, and freedom to transact.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   We knew firsthand how fragile it all was.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I held back releasing ocean work or even this story as I needed time to process the experience.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   After two years of being back on land, I created the Intrepid Ocean series
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   to attempt to work through these thoughts and emotions.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   The experience highlighted the fragility of the global norms and governance systems we take for granted.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Now, after three years back in Australia, we are heading back to our boat in the Caribbean to finish what we started.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The kids are now four, eight, and ten.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So, here we are again on the precipice, about to jump off,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   to find out who we truly are as individuals, as a family.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   The essay I have just read to you was a Twitter post by an account named Intrepid.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   The handle is @Intrepid_P.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Intrepid also answered a couple of questions that were asked by listeners
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   that I think are really useful and illuminating.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Angie says, "I can't believe Australia locked you out. Was there a specific reason?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   My cousin had been in America for over 10 years and it took a while,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   but he flew back into Australia after maybe five months into the pandemic."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Intrepid responds, "It's complex, but essentially, initially, in the first six to eight months,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   there were no flights out of where we were.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   The airport simply shut on the small island nations.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   By the time they relaxed and opened up, the quotas into Australia had been reduced
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   again and were as low as $3,000 per week, with over 50,000 Australians registered with DFAT
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and probably four times not registered wanting to come home.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   This drove flight prices to astronomical levels, peaked at $80,000 per person from London.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Not, obviously, an option for five of us to spend a quarter of a million flying home.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   The reality was Australia kept granting exemptions for critical business trips out of Australia
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   and most of the $3,000 cap was taken by high-priced business travel,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   for whom paying $50,000 was not an issue.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Start contrast to the New Zealand system, where they ran a lottery ticket system to come home
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   rather than let the market decide who could pay to come home.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   We finally managed to book flights via American Airlines via Los Angeles after like 18 months,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and even then, just before we flew, they halved the quota again after we booked.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   American Airlines, to meet this, then simply cancelled every second flight
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and rebooked people six down the track.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   We, by chance, survived this cull.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   The quota at those levels meant that each flight from LA to Sydney only had 32 passengers on it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   This was not sustainable, and so six weeks later, Americans stopped flying completely Australia
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   and just flew freight.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   On arrival home, after having all been vaccinated and having two PCR tests in a week of flying
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   and one on arrival, we then had to pay $5,500 to quarantine for two weeks on arrival,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   same building as the athletes returning from Tokyo Olympics.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   For the $5,500, we got a small hotel room with two beds for five people.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   All up, it cost us close to $50,000 to get home, even after waiting 18 months since the initial lockdown.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Another question that was asked.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Wow, truly impressive story.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Some questions.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   One, how did you access internet?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Two, were you using crypto in the Caribbean as a currency since your bank cards were cut?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And three, same boat for this new voyage?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   One, we would try and get local SIMs from each country we went to.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Internet, however, was difficult in most places.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I had a 4G router with external aerials so we could point them across the ocean and get service from land.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   This time we have Starlink, so it should be different.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Two, sadly, I was using crypto at the time but could not use it directly.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   The islands were very much cash economy, but I could use a portal in Australia,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   then a WISEcard to withdraw local cash.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And three, yes, same boat.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We left it in Aruba when we finally came home.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   We did not trust the flights would actually leave, so could not risk having nowhere to return to by selling it.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Fluke asked a question.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Wow, this is wild.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Being Australian, we were warned to return home immediately or be locked out of the country.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Was there no ability to leave your boat and just fly back when that call came out?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Intrepid responds, no.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   France went into lockdown prior to Australia when Italy had its first outbreaks of the pandemic.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Basically, the airport in St. Martin shut, even to medical evacuations.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   We had no physical options to fly home for about eight months.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   By then, it was financially prohibitive.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Flights from London peaked at $80,000 per person at the worst of it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Essentially, the quota of 3,000 people was taken up by business travelers who got an exemption to fly out of Australia.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   This is why the 50,000 stranded people registered with DFAT essentially stayed at that level for most of the pandemic
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   which is probably four times that in reality.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   This is in stark contrast to New Zealand who ran the quota as a lottery,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and then you bought the flights rather than let airlines use the market to decide who got in.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Even at the end, after almost two years, when we finally got flights out of Los Angeles,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   which still cost $50,000 for the family,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Skomo halved the quota one last time,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and American Airlines simply had to cut every second flight and rebooked eight months down the track.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   They luckily made that cut and came home to then pay $5,500 in quarantine fees
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   despite having been vaccinated and having three PCR tests that week.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Six weeks later, American basically stopped flying as they were limited to something like 32 people per jet
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   under the new rules and only flew freight.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   To be honest, that was one of the most frustrating things coming home.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   People had this view like, "We gave you four weeks to come home."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And it's like, "FFS, there is no way a lot of people could come home."
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   The French side of St. Martin does not even have an international airport,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and they closed the border to the Dutch side,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   so even if it remained open, there would have been no way to cross.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So I'll stop with all the questions, although I thought it was interesting to talk about.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I want you to think about that story this week as you consider your own situation.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Now, most of us, of course, are never going to face something like that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Probably it'll be a few more decades before another pandemic comes, maybe 50 years, who knows.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And a global pandemic is a unique risk.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   It's the only thing that I can come up with that results in a global closure of borders and such all at the exact same time.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   It's the only thing that I know that has that globally simultaneous impact.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   There are many other things that can affect regions,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   but the only thing I've ever come up with that has that simultaneous global impact is a pandemic.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But it's good to stress test and think about, well, what happens in terms of how do you prepare for that?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And what you see is the importance of being prepared to be isolated.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   That leads to physical preparedness.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   But more importantly in this case, you see the importance of backup plans from a documentary perspective.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   This particular writer, Intrepid, you would think that he was pretty well squared away.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   He had a great passport from a great country, a Tier A passport, had the ability to go and live and work in Canada.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   That's a good start. And yet found himself completely trapped because it wasn't good enough.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And I tell you what, the pandemic was definitely motivating to me and a whole lot of other people
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   to make sure you don't only have one residence, but you have multiple countries that you can legally go and live in.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   In most cases, I think that tourists are treated better in countries than residents are.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But when it comes to access to a country, residents are treated ineffably better than tourists.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   So you want to have high quality residencies and you want to have multiple citizenships, if at all possible.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Multiple places where you can go and live and be treated like a citizen.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And the basic value of citizenship is unrestricted right to enter a country.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   How Australia got around with restricting that right is something that is interesting to look at.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   They didn't restrict it legally. They used the market to enforce their restrictions.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And so they said, "Oh, Australian citizens can come back."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   But they highly limited the entrance of people. And then because Australia is such a remote destination,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   they said, "You can come back. And of course, you'll do two weeks of quarantine in an expensive hotel camp that we're going to set up for you."
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But then they used the market to limit the flow of people.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And so it was quite an interesting workaround where they forbade their citizens' entrance for a time.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And then they used the market conditions to keep them low.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   So Australians, that should affect you dramatically in terms of how your government handled that.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Anyway, I don't have anything more to say. I just want to share that interesting story.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I'll link it in the show notes published on Twitter two days ago.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   In closing, make sure to go. And if you're interested in thinking about and planning for solutions and talking with me about this, etc.,
