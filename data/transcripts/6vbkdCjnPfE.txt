[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.160]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.600]   Today we enter day two of our 2015 Conference
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   for Pastors here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.440]   This will be the fullest day of festivities for us
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.380]   The Pastors Conference is streaming online all day today,
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.380]   so go to DesiringGod.org/live for the schedule
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.660]   and for the video stream.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.640]   We're joined again by Matt Chandler.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.480]   He's the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.320]   and the author of the new book, "The Mingling of Souls,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.440]   "God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.480]   And he joins us on the phone from Dallas.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.160]   I've got 10 questions on relationships queued up for him
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.420]   and we're working through them.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.880]   And we are on to question number four.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.720]   Matt, what can members of local churches do practically
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.940]   to help godly marriages happen?
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.160]   Instead of just telling men to man up
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.760]   and get your life together,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.520]   and instead of simply telling women to stop waiting around
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.720]   and be active in their singleness,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.920]   what role should community play
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800]   in deciding who and when to marry?
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.780]   Any advice for inviting others
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.960]   into a relationship to that end?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.000]   - I mean, I just love this question
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.720]   because I'm just such a big believer
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   in what God has called the covenant community of his people
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400]   to be in a local context.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.720]   I think the way that local churches
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.360]   can practically help godly marriages happen
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.560]   outside of telling men to man up,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.520]   'cause I do think there's a space for that,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.360]   and telling women to, single women in particular,
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.880]   to stop waiting around and be active in your singleness.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.400]   So I don't wanna say that there aren't places for that
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.320]   'cause there most definitely is.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.680]   But instead of just doing that,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.280]   I think what we wanna do is work really hard in our churches
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.480]   to create a culture of discipleship,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.240]   a culture in which the norm is, the air we breathe,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   is that older men are serious
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.320]   about seeking out younger men to train them,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   not just train them in the Bible,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.320]   but really train them in what it looks like
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.200]   to apply the scriptures to their lives.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.720]   What does it look like to serve, love,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   and encourage your wife?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.180]   What does it look like to romance her?
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.560]   What does it look like to be a man of God
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040]   in relation to your wife?
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   And so we try to do this personally
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.740]   by having single men into our home.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.180]   And so when I have them over,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.400]   Lauren will almost always cook the meal,
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.560]   I'll help set the table,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.680]   and then afterwards,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.920]   that young man gets to help me do the dishes.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   And that's just my way of going,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.860]   hey, this is a way that I serve my wife.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.160]   And then while we do this,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.920]   I tend to just talk about the ways
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.820]   that I try to make space for Lauren's gifts.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.100]   So this is an intentional, organic
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.260]   kind of culture of discipleship
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.660]   that I hope is woven into the life of the village.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660]   On top of that, my hope would be
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.100]   that young men would seek out older men.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.460]   And I've told them before, hound older men.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.800]   It's not a, let's go through a book together.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.660]   It's like, can I get in your space?
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.220]   Whatever you normally do,
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.320]   can I just come join you in that?
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.980]   So if you, can I come have dinner at your house?
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.300]   And I mean, nothing, just let me sit there,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.560]   watch you interact with,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340]   your family and let me ask questions
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.340]   and to build those types of friendships.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.440]   The appeal of youthfulness in churches
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.420]   is just so heavy and so celebrated.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.260]   And yet I've found that really without
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.980]   a good mix of generations,
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.380]   then you're gonna get lopsided and silly.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.860]   And the worst possible thing imaginable in my mind
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.260]   is a bunch of 24 year olds
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.580]   sitting around talking about life.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.060]   So if I can get that 24 year old single
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.300]   with a 38 year old married man,
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.840]   then I've got real high hopes
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780]   for how that 24 year old will see marriage,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.700]   understand marriage and desire marriage.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.460]   And then at the end of the day,
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.260]   I think, so that's a kind of training discipleship culture.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.220]   But then on top of that,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.740]   I think what you celebrate
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.620]   and how you celebrate is important.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.760]   And so we wanna celebrate marriages at the Village Church.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.540]   And I wanna celebrate women and men
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.280]   who have given themselves over to make disciples,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.320]   whether they're married or not.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.300]   And so in the beautiful design series
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.240]   that I finished this fall,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.340]   I wanted to constantly come back to single women
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.140]   and single men who had given themselves over
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.500]   to make disciples and celebrate the fact
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.820]   that they had done that.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.380]   And so more than it is me saying,
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100]   hey, get over your singleness,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.420]   it's me celebrating the fact that there are those
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.220]   not sitting around on Valentine's Day,
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.260]   wanting to be taken out for a movie,
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.880]   but rather there are those who are having their lives
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.800]   wrung out in the making of disciples
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.140]   for their own joy and own fulfillment of heart,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.120]   while simultaneously probably still desiring marriage,
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.860]   desiring a spouse,
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.780]   but not just kind of sitting on their hands
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.500]   until they get one.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.340]   - Thank you.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.660]   And thank you for not only talking about it,
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.180]   but also for modeling this priority on discipleship.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's Matt Chandler,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.420]   the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.340]   and the author of the new book,
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.460]   "The Mingling of Souls,
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.860]   God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption."
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.300]   Tomorrow, I wanna ask a common question from the guys.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.940]   Should I date a godly girl that I do not find attractive?
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.900]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.740]   (silence)
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.900]   (silence)
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.060]   (silence)
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:47.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
