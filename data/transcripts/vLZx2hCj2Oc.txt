[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700]   This question came from a user named David T., "Can you tell
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.940]   me why the decision was taken to capitalize the second quote in
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.080]   1 Timothy 5.18, 'The labor is worthy of his wages,'" and it's
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.120]   in all caps, "but it wasn't capitalized in the NASB 95."
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.840]   "The labor is worthy of his wages" is not actually a
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.400]   quotation from the Old Testament, it's a quotation from
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.280]   the Lord Jesus.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.000]   So we put that in caps but if you look at that and you see a
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.840]   reference there in Luke 19.13 that is also an allusion to
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.120]   certain statements in the Old Testament.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.380]   So while it is a quotation of the Lord Jesus we put it in
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.440]   caps it is also an allusion to the Old Testament.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100]   And if the Lord Jesus said it that's of equal authority with
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880]   any quotation from the Old Testament.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   So that's why we put both of them in capital letters.
