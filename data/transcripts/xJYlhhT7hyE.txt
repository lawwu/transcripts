[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.700]   So let's get on to the meat of our business today, which is our
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.180]   next core idea segment. And I thought I would tackle the topic
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.120]   for which I am probably best known, which is deep work. So
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   I'm known for deep work because of the book I published in 2016
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.800]   of that same name. This was a book that had a bit of a quiet
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.600]   launch. It was a Wall Street Journal bestseller for a week
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.880]   or so. And that was just off of the strength of my email list
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.840]   audience at that time, and it sort of went under the radar.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.120]   And then a year or so later, something just started to
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   happen, people kept buying it, and they started buying it at a
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.960]   higher rate than they did before. And it's a book that
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   never actually had a week in which it was gangbusters. It
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.640]   never had a week in which it was number two on the charts on
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   Amazon. It never had a Mark Manson or James Clear moment.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.440]   But this book has quietly moved into almost 40 languages now,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.000]   you can get this book in a lot of places. There is a Mongolian
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.880]   version of this book. We have a book being sold as a French,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.560]   French speaking Africa version of the book. It's a lot of
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.520]   places. It's also quietly sold in English more than a million
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000]   units. So just it's out there. It's had an impact, but never,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   never loudly. It's a little background, little background.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.400]   So let's talk about the book. Let's talk about it. Three
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.560]   things. Three things to cover here. Number one, what is it?
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   Number two, why is it important? Number three, how do you do it
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.720]   better? Those are the three key points we're gonna talk about
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.400]   the books. Number one, what is deep work? It is an activity.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520]   People often explode or expand this definition to cover all
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   sorts of different things, entire lifestyles, whole value
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.460]   judgment systems about what work is important, what's not. Deep
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.800]   work is none of those things. It is a humble description for a
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.600]   very specific activity. It is when you are focusing without
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.440]   distraction on a cognitively demanding task. If you're doing
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.200]   that activity, you're doing deep work. Now let's unfold those two
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   parts. The easy part of that is cognitively demanding. So you're
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.520]   working on something hard and you're thinking hard about it.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.720]   There's a hard thing and you're thinking hard about it. That's
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.840]   the easy part of the definition. The more demanding part of the
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280]   definition is that you're doing this without distraction. Now
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040]   what I mean by that more technically is that you are
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   doing this cognitively demanding work in the absence of context
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.840]   shifts. A context shift is when you turn the focus of your
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.000]   attention from one cognitive context to another for a session
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.360]   to count as deep work. You cannot be doing those switches.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.280]   So if you're working on something non cognitively
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.240]   demanding, let's say you're you're trying to format properly
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.720]   a chart in PowerPoint. That's not cognitively demanding.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   That's not deep work. Let's say you are doing something
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.800]   cognitively demanding, you are trying to write a strategy memo.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   It's, it's hard, you got to think about this, like, what are
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   we trying to say here, I have to say this just right. But let's
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   say while you're writing the strategy memo, every five to
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.360]   six minutes, you quick check your email inbox, you glance at
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.680]   your phone to see what's going on. That session also does not
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.600]   count as deep work because you are doing these context shifts,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.320]   which significantly degrades your cognitive effectiveness. So
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.760]   if you can avoid the shifts, you're working on something
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.240]   hard, you are doing deep work. Otherwise, you're either doing
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.440]   shallow work, which is work that's not cognitively
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   demanding, or you're doing pseudo deep work, which is you're
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.640]   working on something hard, but you keep switching context. So
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.880]   you are at a fraction of your capability of producing clean
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.920]   thought. So that's all deep work is a particular type of
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.840]   activity, among many types of activities you might do during
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.000]   typical workday. Number two, why is it important? Well, I first
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.560]   want to make make clear that there's not a moral hierarchy
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.280]   here, there is not an argument that the only type of work that
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.960]   matters is deep work. We know in almost any professional context,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.160]   there's lots of other types of efforts that are critical for
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.480]   those efforts. Right? If you are not properly invoicing your
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.560]   clients, which is not a deep activity, but if you are not
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   properly invoicing your clients, you're going to get no money and
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.400]   your business is going to go out of business. A couple years ago,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.120]   I was to give another example, the Director of Graduate Studies
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.080]   for the Computer Science Department here at Georgetown
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   and something we had to do each spring as part of that role is
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.080]   build a budget that talked about for every doctoral student we
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.200]   have. Where is the money coming from for the tuition for the
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.240]   research assistantship for the TA ship for the health insurance,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.960]   we had to work out this budget. And there's nothing about that
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.160]   this that was deep, it wasn't cognitively demanding, it was
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   just a huge pain. Because as you can imagine, it's complicated to
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.120]   untangle this is coming from a grant. And this is coming from a
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.440]   fellowship. And this is coming from a from the department
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.480]   funds. But you know what, critically important work
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.680]   without it, the students don't get paid. And they can't do what
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.640]   they're trying to do. So deep work is not from a moral
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   standpoint, the only work that matters. But in many
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   professional contexts, and this was the core concept for my book
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   deep work, it is the deep efforts that move the needle.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.720]   Ultimately, the activity that produces the value that allows
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.120]   you to keep doing what you're doing that allows you to get
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.920]   promoted and what you're doing that allows your company to grow
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.880]   or be more successful. Typically, these core activities
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.640]   are going to have a foundation of deep work. So it's what moves
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.760]   the needle. This is particularly clear in knowledge work work
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.120]   where you're sitting at a computer screen all day. No one's
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.320]   going to pay your company for how quickly you answer emails,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.680]   no one's going to pay your company because you are really
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.200]   rocking zoom meeting after zoom meeting, no one's going to pay
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.120]   you or give money to your company because you're jumping
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.760]   on calls, no one's going to pay you or your company, because
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.040]   you're shooting around PowerPoint decks with rapid
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.480]   speed, what are they going to pay your company for in a
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.720]   knowledge work context, adding value to information, this is
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   almost always a effort of deep work, skilled thought on
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.040]   something, if it was not skilled thought or difficult, it would
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.920]   be easily replicatable and his value would plummet. You run the
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.080]   ad agency, there's a lot of stuff you have to do to keep the
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.960]   lights on, but it's coming up with the really good ad
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   campaigns that gets you paid. You run the tech company,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.960]   there's a lot you have to do to make sure that the code is
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.240]   released properly and marketed. But if you're not writing
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.440]   fantastic code, it gives you a good stable product, you're out
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.560]   of business. There's a lot that goes into marketing books. But
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   if you're not writing fantastic book, it doesn't matter how much
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.680]   of that you're doing. So in knowledge work, shallow efforts
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   keep the lights on deep work moves the needle, it's
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.040]   important that the core of what creates value. In other types of
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.280]   industries, this is even more clear. If you're an athlete,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.120]   all about the deep efforts, the deep training and the deep
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.320]   performance training is a matter of deep work, focused
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.360]   incredibly intensely on what you're trying to do. Performing
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.120]   you're on the court, you're on the field, incredibly deep,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.000]   focused effort, no distraction. So deep work is clearly what
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.120]   moves the needle there. See this in art, you see this in the
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.600]   skilled crafts, if I'm a elite woodworker, ultimately, what
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.760]   matters more than anything else in my producing beautifully made
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.600]   very well constructed artifacts. So deep work is often what moves
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.520]   the needle, not the only effort that matters, but it's what
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.880]   often moves the needle. The issue we got into, this was the
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   premise of the book deep work, the issue we have gotten into
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.560]   more recently is that we forgot that. We began to think about
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.920]   all work being work, it's all equal, either you're doing stuff
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.000]   or you're not. And if you're doing stuff and working hard,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.040]   that's good. And if you're not doing stuff and working hard,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.840]   that's bad. We stopped differentiating between deep
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.560]   work and shallow work. And why was this a problem? Because we
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.160]   had developments in the digital world. Tools like low friction
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.800]   communication channels, email, slack, we got highly distracting
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.280]   entertainment like YouTube and social media pulling out our
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.040]   attention from the phones, we got zoom and PowerPoint slides
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.320]   and jumping on calls and our work got more ambiguous, it
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.840]   became less clear exactly what it is that we do. And in this
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.640]   context, we fell into this mode where increasingly you could go
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.080]   through most of your day never actually concentrating hard
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.720]   without distraction. Most of your day is now on calls in
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.680]   emails on zoom, changing those proverbial fonts and trying to
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   get that chart to work in your PowerPoint slides. And we all
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.440]   patted ourselves on the back and said, Look how busy we are.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.720]   We're crushing it, we're getting after it. But we forgot that we
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   weren't doing the actual underlying core deep work
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.000]   activities that was going to allow this company to keep
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.480]   existing in the first place is gonna allow you to continue to
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.320]   keep your job in the first place. We were on the deck of
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.560]   the Titanic, sending Instagram pictures of our deck chair
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.320]   arrangements, not even realizing that the ship underneath us was
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.880]   sinking. And so the core argument in the book is that is
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.840]   a problem. But it's also an opportunity. Because what we
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.200]   have is a situation where there's really important thing
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.440]   is becoming more scarce. So guess what, if you are one of
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.640]   the few people to prioritize it, if you're one of the few
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.320]   organizations to prioritize it, you are going to get a
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.040]   disproportionate competitive advantage. If you prioritize
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.160]   depth in an increasingly shallow world, there is large reward
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.440]   that you are going to get. So we could see it as a negative, we
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.080]   are forgetting about deep work as we drown in the shallow or
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.800]   you can see as a positive, everyone else is doing that. But
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.880]   I don't. And I'm getting wildly and disproportionately rewarded
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.320]   for that. Because you know, the old saying, you don't have to be
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   faster than a bear. When you run into that grizzly in the park,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.000]   you just have to be faster than the person who's there with you.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.120]   There will get him first. So that's why deep work is
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.200]   important. So what we need is to make sure that it's something
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.680]   that we prioritize. And it has a good presence, an intentional
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   presence in our working life. Right. So the third idea here is
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.840]   how do we do that? How do we do deep work better? Well, that's
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.040]   most of my book. I have a keynote I've been giving for a
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.240]   long time where I spend 30 minutes going through examples
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   about this. It's an endlessly rich topics. Let me just give
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.120]   you a sampling of some ideas here about what matters. If you
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.040]   want to take advantage of this reality that deep work is
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.200]   valuable, but becoming more scarce. One just defining it is
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.000]   critical. The fact that we have terminology is at the core of
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.840]   any change. Just knowing deep work is different than shallow
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   work allows you to actually say, Oh, I see what we're trying to
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.480]   do here. Otherwise, the only knob you have to turn is work
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.760]   harder or not. Stay up later, be on your phone more. As soon as
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.360]   the plane lands, whip it out, do those emails. If you don't know
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.440]   what it is you're trying to do better, you're not going to
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   actually do the right things better. So defining this key to
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   you need to measure it and you need to have goals. One of the
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   most important ideas from that book, I believe was the deep to
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.640]   shallow work ratio. The concept is you figure out for your
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.760]   particular position. What is the ideal ratio of deep work hours
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.320]   to non deep work hours in a standard work week? This will
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.640]   differ depending on your job. But you should know what the
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.120]   right answer is. And if you work for someone else, you should
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.360]   have this conversation with the person you work for, with your
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.120]   supervisor. Here's what deep work is, here's what shallow
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.040]   work is both is important, we have to get the invoices out the
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.840]   door. But if I'm not producing good ad copy, we're not going to
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   get any more money. What is the ratio in my job that I should do
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   that will best serve this company and you get a number and
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.480]   then you measure and if you already time block plan, you can
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.920]   just look straight on your time block plan for the week and see
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.960]   all the blocks that you've marked off as deep work blocks.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.880]   It's easy to actually get these numbers, but you measure and you
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.520]   say, Hey, here's how we're doing. You and I talked about
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.480]   this and said it should be 5050. Guess what I got two hours of
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.760]   deep work in last week. Remember, it does not count as
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.880]   deep work if it is not hard. And if it's not with zero
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.120]   distraction. Now you're confronting a clear number. We
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.800]   decided 5050 would best serve this company. We're nowhere near
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.080]   5050. We either have to say, you know what, Cal, I don't want you
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.840]   to do any deep work. Which is crazy, because again, that's
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.360]   what creates the value or you say we're gonna have to make
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.960]   some changes. And then you get changes to the company culture.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.680]   Then you get more flexibility, your workload changes, it is a
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.000]   driver for change that comes from a place of positivity. If
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.960]   you work for yourself to do the same exercise, here's the ratio,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.360]   I'm going to hold myself to it. If I'm not hitting it, something
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.560]   has to change. Schedule your deep work time is another big
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.360]   one that's very important. Do not wait for the instinct to hit
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.640]   you. You know, I'm just in the mood to do some deep work and
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.840]   have nothing to do. That's never going to happen. If that
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.520]   happens, you're not working hard enough. That's not something
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.840]   that's going to arise naturally. So you need to get it on your
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.400]   calendar one way or the other and treat it like you would any
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.680]   other meeting or appointment. That's time that is protected.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.440]   That's time that you cannot overschedule. Have a philosophy
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.840]   for how you do this. Maybe it's the same time on the same days
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.640]   every week. Maybe instead when you do your weekly plan is more
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.240]   bespoke. Here's where I'm going to fit it in this week. Maybe
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.400]   you take one day a week where you do just deep work and the
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.320]   other days you don't. However you want to do it, but have a
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.560]   philosophy, schedule it, protect it, and if possible, have
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.840]   rituals surrounding these actual sessions that really helps your
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.120]   mind slip into the deep work mode. I do the same walk, I go
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.400]   to the same secondary office space, I make the very same cup
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.600]   of coffee in the same cup, have a ritual. So your brain knows,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.040]   oh, it's time to do deep work. Finally, you have to train this
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.520]   ability concentration is hard. If you look at your phone and
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.480]   every single piece of downtime you have, you are out of
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   cognitive shape. You're a cognitive slob. And if you give
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.280]   yourself a two hour window and say, let's go do some deep work.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.160]   That's like taking the guy who is in terrible shape. You'd be
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.120]   like, look, man, we're gonna run some stadiums. It's not going to
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.480]   go well. You are going to be distracted. It's going to be
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.800]   difficult. You are going to literally be sweating. You're
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.880]   like, this is terrible. And that's because you haven't
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.240]   trained. So don't give up if it's hard. That just means you
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.480]   haven't been you haven't been on your virtual Peloton yet long
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   enough to get those virtual lungs back in shape here. All
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.360]   right, so you have to train, which means you have to spend
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.960]   time free from distractions on a regular basis, read books,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.800]   because that forces your mind to concentrate, do productive
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.200]   meditation, where you try to work on a professional problem,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.440]   just in your head as you walk that is fantastic training.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.600]   Board games, any type of strategy game where you have to
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.040]   think hard about it, do all these type of things.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.680]   complicated hobbies that require real focus and skill, be it
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.240]   manual or physical, you have to get your mind in shape. If
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.040]   you're going to succeed at deep work, it's not enough just to
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.640]   say I'm going to do it. You got trained for it.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.160]   Alright, so those are the main three ideas about deep work,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.600]   what it is, why it's important, and how to get better at it. And
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.840]   I'm going to add a coda here that I think is also critically
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.920]   important, which is, once you are doing these things, you have
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.600]   to work the word deep into your everyday conversation as a
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.520]   prefix and adjective absolutely as much as possible. That's how
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.520]   people know you're awesome. And people are going to think you're
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.680]   really cool if you do it. And that's my final piece of
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.640]   advice. You need to walk in and be like, Hey, guys, deep Monday,
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.520]   am I right? Yeah, it's gonna get some deep coffee break over
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.560]   there. No, you're doing a little deep urination or good work
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.840]   with that you come back, we'll deep it up, stay deep. Let's
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.160]   deep on deep on over to the deep conference room, man, we're gonna
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.240]   go deep on these type of things. This is going to make you sound
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.000]   awesome. And people are going to love you. Jesse here will will
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.160]   attest every time I see him. We fist bump and say, people
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.800]   people. You can attest to that. You see each other in the
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.440]   street, people people, let it explode. If you're going to do
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.400]   all this work, you got to let people know. And I'll make you
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   it trust me, I know from personal experience, people love
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.560]   it when you use the word deep all the time, and they think
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.320]   you're awesome. So let's throw that in there. Alright guys,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.280]   that's it core idea. Work deeply, people meeple.
