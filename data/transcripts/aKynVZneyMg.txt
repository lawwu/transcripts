[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   remember at this time period there was no data. Like people think there was like lots of data.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.360]   We had data that we weren't sure we could trust out of Wuhan. We had data off two cruise ships
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   and a little bit of information when we were able to call our friends who could connect us to other
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.680]   friends who were physicians in northern Italy. That's all the data we had. There was all this
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.840]   talk of epidemiological models, all these things. There were no models that were like, this is the
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.600]   gold standard. There's no weather model for this. We were able luckily enough to have,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   and this story actually interestingly enough is being super detailed by Michael Lewis and his
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320]   book that's released today. We had this amazing woman, Charity Dean, who was working on things.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.280]   We had another guy, Adam Reedhead, who was another public health official and Amy Tong, who was
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.400]   running information technology for the state of California. He's an amazing human. These are
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.880]   people we should be grateful for. What they were putting together was like, well, what's the model?
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.560]   We found that one of the models, everyone was looking at the models for all of the states.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.200]   The model for Delaware is the same as the model for California. That doesn't make sense. That
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.080]   doesn't help us think about how to think about LA, San Francisco versus Alpine County or Tahoe area.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   We needed a more sophisticated one. Luckily, there was a research scientist named Justin
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.000]   Lester out of John Hopkins who had a pretty sophisticated model. This is a model of what?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.360]   What are you modeling? This is modeling. It's basically a set of differential equations.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.680]   It says basically a person's, you start with the population, you sprinkle some base conditions of
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.400]   those that are infected. They at some percentage get other people to be infected, symptomatic,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.240]   asymptomatic ratios. Some portion of them will die. Some portion of them will survive.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.200]   That's it. It's super simple. Now, you need other things in there. What about people who commute
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.560]   between the Bay Area and LA? What about different age demographics? What about closing schools? What
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.920]   will that do? They had started to build more and more sophistication in the model. You could run
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.320]   an ensemble, many, many scenarios. The only problem is this was a research thing. It's running under
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.160]   somebody's desk. Luckily, we were able to call on Sam Shaw, who really deserves a lot of credit for
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.960]   scaling people you may know at LinkedIn. Jonathan Goldman and Mike Greenfield really came up with
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.480]   the ideas. Sam Shaw scaled it and made it really a machine learning platform. Josh Wills, who
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.680]   was at Cloudera and then at Slack, figuring out how to make digital engineering work. The two of
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.680]   them with Justin Lessiter's team and with a massive help from Werner Vogel and the Amazon team,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.640]   took that model and ported it over in a matter of days. Now, we're able to run hundreds of
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.560]   simulations. Those simulations are what led to those first graphs that people saw of the exponential
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   curve that were shown on press conferences by Governor Gavin Newsom. That also led everyone
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.040]   to see, "Holy cow, if we don't get this under control, here's where our bed capacity is right
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   now. Here's our bed capacity if we put them in parking lots and do everything. Here's the curve."
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   A lot of people at that time were like, "This is garbage." They didn't see what's happening
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.560]   literally in India right now. They weren't seeing what was happening in New York. That model,
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.000]   that effort of a combination of data scientists, state experts, and technologists combined together
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.720]   with the policy makers, that's what led to the state order on saying, "We need to stay at home."
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.800]   Because there's one goal. One goal is to preserve the healthcare system for tomorrow.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   Because if physicians get sick or die, you don't get that back. That model, those efforts with
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   Governor Newsom and him, is what allowed other states to realize that they need to take action
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.800]   as well. That's what led us to the follow-on orders and actually being able to make sure that
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.320]   we didn't have happen what we saw in New York, happen in San Francisco or in LA, even though LA
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.040]   was still hammered from those efforts. There was so much more data that we started to realize.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.120]   That was just one part, because then it was like, "Hey, how do we help policy makers with richer,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.120]   deeper understanding of ideas?" We had to bring data in and draw the insights.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.280]   Luckily for me, one of those people who answered the call on the first ring was Roger. Roger said,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.240]   "I'd be happy to volunteer." Because we were all volunteers. No one was paid. This is all volunteer
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   all the time. We were all just trying to do our best. Roger, you should take over, because you led
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.520]   the next portion. One of the interesting things that happened is what came out of that model was
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   a need to look at mobility data. We started getting a lot of data about how people are moving around.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.560]   We noticed some things about that that ended up leading. I think this is what's so interesting
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.200]   about it, is the data led to thinking a lot about ethnography. It ended up being behavior that
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.160]   mattered and then turning that behavior into something we could do. I'll just give one quick
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   example. In the spring in Los Angeles, there is a bioluminescent event. These algae glow, and people
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.360]   want to go to the beach to look at them. People brought this up and were like, "Well, what are
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.240]   we going to do about it?" It's like, "We got to keep people off the beaches. We got to keep people
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.160]   off the beaches." At that time, this was April, I think late April, early May. I think enough
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   people on the team knew it was an aerosol and that spreading apart was okay. This is my remembering
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.000]   it. It might have not been as clear as it seems now. Now, we know for sure it's an aerosol,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.240]   but that's how I remember it. One of the things we did is like, "No, we're not going to keep
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.560]   people off the beaches. Let's keep people safe on the beaches." Here's what we had. We knew that
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.960]   people were moving around a little bit. I think at that time, there was a little upward movement.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.120]   We told people in Los Angeles that what you need to do is maybe have some people to keep people
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.760]   spread apart and stuff. Of course, there weren't going to be as many people anyway as doing that.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.320]   Then we started doing stuff like preparing for Thanksgiving in August. What do you tell people?
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.960]   The harvest was a big... The real boost in California's rates came because the harvest,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.480]   which was a perfect equation for how you're going to get infections in a community. I don't know
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   if you remember, I think Imperial County at one time had the highest rates in the world.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.360]   It was totally because of the harvest. What we ended up doing is using data to try to communicate
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.640]   to the people in the state and to think about behavior things that then we would maybe build
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.440]   new. They really weren't models. They were really just studies about what we could do or what was
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.680]   happening that we could intervene better. We started going from where everything was statewide
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.840]   at first to talking about rural versus urban, because there's very different things going on,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:29.440]   depending on the density and characteristics. Trying to also learn things like the Bay Area
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.400]   did better than the rest of the state. I think the trivial reasons why really ended up not being
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.640]   the reasons why. The trivial reason was people could remote work easier and an educated population.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.520]   This isn't something we found, but a lot of it had to do with the Bay Area's experience with AIDS
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   and having to deal with another pandemic. It was community, community access.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.760]   As we started seeing mobility data showing more movement, we brought in someone from New Haven
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.480]   who had done some really interesting work around how do you deal with that community part.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:12.000]   What I like to think is what happened is the basis was laid with data. Then we were using that to go
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.280]   to this next level of mixing that data with some qualitative and behavior. We had some ethnographers
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.640]   on the team. We started doing a lot of surveys. We would use those surveys to, at the end,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   Deji, I don't know how much of you were involved towards the end of this, but really the surveys
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.960]   ended up being the driving force behind the comms that were going afterwards, which is, again,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   another qualitative thing. We made sure that the surveys were being a better instrument
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.520]   for pulling stuff. This is one of those lucky breaks. I happen to run all the surveys at
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:48.960]   O'Reilly. I had some survey experience and we were able to bring that in and improve.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:56.160]   Kara DeFrias really deserves credit for having the survey idea. What she did is she basically
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.360]   convinced the state to basically put just an open-ended set of questions on one of the
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.880]   highly trafficked web pages. It just sampled and it was just a way of getting feedback.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.040]   The problem is it's very hard to get a feedback on a state the size of California,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.520]   just given the disparity. One of the things that was prepared every night at that point was
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.800]   basically a briefing book for the governor and the key staff. It had charts and graphs and all
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.400]   sorts of really important key insights, but also it had snippets of key things that we heard from
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:42.320]   the real population, real stories. These weren't data points anymore. They were people. They had
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:49.440]   names. They had ages. They had stories. You read those things and you could feel the fear.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.800]   You could feel the pain. No longer could you just be like, "Well, it's an uptick.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:03.360]   We'll see what happens." No, that uptick destroyed a family. Like, "Oh, it's just a harvest." No,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.520]   we're about to destroy a community. What are we going to do about it?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:14.480]   It changes the whole narrative and approach you take from just being a data science thing and
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:23.680]   thinking about this in this abstract and playing with graphs to if we do not act right now with
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:35.040]   immediate sense of urgency, somebody will die. It's not an if. Someone will die. Our actions
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:43.200]   directly help the shift in balance of who that is and how do we make sure that they get the
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:50.720]   best shot at surviving. Our job fundamentally was to use data to give everyone a shot at living.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.080]   If a hospital doesn't have oxygen, figure out how to get them the oxygen so those people have
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.360]   a chance. If people don't realize that the people around them are highly infected, let's give them
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.600]   a shot to actually be able to take safety measures in their own hands so they can survive and increase
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   the probability that they are okay or some other family member that they may expose will be okay.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:19.680]   If you're enjoying Grady Descent, I'd really love for you to check out Fully Connected,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.120]   which is an inclusive machine learning community that we're building to let everyone know about
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:32.160]   all the stuff going on in ML and all the new research coming out. If you go to wmb.ai/fc,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.480]   you can see all the different stuff that we do, including Grady Descent, but also salons where
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.680]   we talk about new research and folks share insights, AMAs where you can directly connect
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.120]   with members of our community, and a Slack channel where you can get answers to everything from very
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.000]   basic questions about ML to bug reports on weights and biases to how to hire an ML team.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.680]   We're looking forward to meeting you.
