[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.960]   episode 203.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.620]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.680]   producer, Jesse.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.280]   Jesse, it took me what, six months to stop
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.440]   calling you my professor?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.480]   It's muscle memory.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.600]   You said it a few times.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.680]   It was pretty funny.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.980]   It was actually pretty common.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.200]   Let me use this muscle memory.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   During the semester, I, you know, I'm around
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.440]   other professors, but now I feel like I have that in.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   Speaking of the Deep Work HQ, I've been
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.640]   thinking about it recently.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.460]   We've talked about this before, but now I
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.140]   want to get serious.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.680]   Maybe get some serious feedback about it
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.440]   because we're coming up to the point where we
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.200]   signed the new lease, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.560]   And as Jesse will attest, we have yet to do
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.800]   work on any part of this HQ except the studio.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.360]   You're a busy guy.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.000]   You got a lot of stuff going on, but it'd be fun.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.360]   I am a busy guy.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.920]   Uh, but the studio we put a lot, you know,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.800]   we're, we're, we're always working on the studio.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.440]   We're always adding new technology.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.160]   We always have people coming in and out, be
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.560]   it sound technicians or FCC experts, shout
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.880]   out the Albert power company.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.320]   Like we're always working on things.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.640]   We have video people, et cetera.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.160]   The rest of the HQ is, uh, dismal.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   And I think it's time that we actually make
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.700]   this into, into something better.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.000]   We've talked about this before, but we've
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.880]   never had a good idea.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.860]   You've been here now for a while.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.600]   What should, what are we going to do?
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.920]   We got a large room, a common space room
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.640]   that has bookshelves that I'm about to ransack
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.480]   for my new library study at home.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.440]   And we have a, a standalone office
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   that right now is storage.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600]   We have a bunch of old lights in there
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.000]   and in piles of books.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.040]   First thing we need is, yeah, we need to get
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.520]   what books to fill that.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.480]   And we need a cleaning lady.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.320]   We do need a cleaning service.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   We should have a clean late, like once a month.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.320]   The people next door have one.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.040]   So we should get in on that.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560]   And I also want to get on, this is, this
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.880]   is riveting for the audience.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.440]   I also want to get in on the, uh, the big
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.520]   water bottles that goes into the bubbler
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.160]   water dispenser thing because the water's
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   like really metal here and not good.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.440]   Uh, I do want to get into that, but I
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.200]   got to figure it out.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.920]   I'm thinking about, maybe we can have
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   other writers right here.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.480]   I don't know.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.560]   I was thinking about making the conference,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.960]   putting like a giant table in the middle
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.160]   of the common space, like a library table,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.520]   or maybe it should be like couches and
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.920]   chairs and I don't know, man, I'm terrible.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.240]   Buy some furniture, throw it back at
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280]   the truck, just haul it over.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.920]   Well, anyways, one way or the other, uh,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.360]   I'm inspired by getting my, my study and
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.280]   my home back in the shape I'm inspired to.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   We'll get the HQ, uh, into some sort of shape.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.160]   That's exciting.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   You're going to some sort of shape.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   I think having some of my writer friends
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.760]   be able to like reserve time and come out
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.840]   here and get away from their home and
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.040]   write, that could be cool.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.240]   That would be really cool.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.560]   Actually.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.720]   We can even get some other
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.520]   podcasters in here.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   We like when we're not using it.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.080]   Don't want this all to go to waste.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.840]   I have big plans, but no time.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.320]   Um, all right.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.360]   Well, anyways, we've got a good show.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   God, I'm looking here.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.400]   I'm looking through the script.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.360]   We've got some good questions.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.640]   We got some good calls.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.960]   We'll get through a lot here.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.880]   Uh, I want to start with a.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.400]   A brief news reaction as usual.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.480]   I'm, I'm less interested in the details
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   of the news as much as using this as a
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.360]   hook to get into a, maybe a slightly
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.280]   larger discussion of some bigger points
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   going on with tech and culture.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.160]   But I wanted to start with an article
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   that a listener sent me that
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.080]   came from Pew Research.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.240]   All right.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.320]   So it's a, an article.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.280]   This is from June 27th.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.600]   So quite recent for those who are
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.880]   watching on YouTube, youtube.com/
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.080]   Calendarport media, you can see the
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.400]   article, those who are listening at home.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.040]   I'll narrate it.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.880]   The title of this article is Twitter
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.560]   is the go-to social media site for us
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.320]   journalists, but not for the public.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800]   Uh, if we, we look at it,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.680]   it's based off of a survey.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.480]   So a recent Pew Research Center survey
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.040]   of people from the news industry.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.560]   So we have reporters, editors, and
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.320]   others working in the news industry.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   I want to hone in on one particular
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   chart, which you, you should be seeing.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.840]   I'm going to scroll this up now.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.680]   There we go.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   So you should be seeing this
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   chart if you're watching online.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.000]   Basically, if you're listening, here's
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.760]   what it is, it's two bar graphs.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.680]   On the left, it shows for each of these
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240]   common social media style sites.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.160]   What percentage of us journalists say
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.880]   they use that most or second most in their
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.760]   job, and then on the right, it is what
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.680]   percentage of us adults say they use that
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.120]   platform, particular platform
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   regularly to get news.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.040]   So we're comparing the platforms
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.200]   that journalists use regularly.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.400]   When their top two sites they use in
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.000]   their job versus the websites that the.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.760]   Average us adult uses to get news.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.240]   That's the comparison being shown here.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.120]   Left is journalist, right is adults.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.480]   The big thing you'll notice, and this
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.920]   is from the headline is that for the
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.440]   journalist, Twitter dominates 69% of
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.720]   the journalists surveyed say Twitter is
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.920]   the top one or two platforms they use
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   for their job.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   You look next to it, you look at us
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.280]   adults and you see Twitter is 13%.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.040]   13% regularly used to have to get news.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.360]   So there is a major difference between
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.160]   the digital world in which journalists
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.840]   live versus the digital world in which
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.760]   most us adults live, journalists are
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.800]   very Twitter focused.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.200]   That is where they find news.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.600]   That is where news is discussed.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.160]   The average American adult is not.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.040]   Now this matters for a couple of reasons.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.840]   One, as we've covered numerous
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   times on this show, there is a real
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.640]   effect, a real filter effect of what
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.800]   you see and how it is portrayed based
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.640]   on the particular platform you look at.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   So Twitter creates its own ecosystem
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.160]   of what's important and what's not
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.000]   important, how we should feel about this,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.120]   how we shouldn't feel about this.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.640]   And it's a very emotionally salient
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.720]   ecosystem, so it not only pushes things
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   to the forefront as being important,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   but it does so with great emotional gusto.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.960]   So if you're a journalist who
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.920]   lives in this world, you are being
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.480]   exposed to these huge, seemingly
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.680]   huge upswellings of emotion and
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.880]   commitment and engagement and activism,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.120]   which may actually be largely
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.080]   artifice or at the very least, largely
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.600]   separate from what the population
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.480]   as a whole believes.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.400]   This is why, as we covered in previous
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   shows, we're beginning to see some of
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.560]   the major news companies pushing their
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   staff away from Twitter because of this
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.760]   effect, New York Times being the most
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.360]   prominent example of them telling
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.560]   their reporters, please stop using
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.400]   Twitter. This is not helping
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.600]   the quality of our reporting.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.360]   The other issue with Twitter, it's
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.080]   not captured directly, but as implied
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.560]   by this graph, is that the reaction to
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.400]   what you do as an individual who posts
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.920]   on Twitter can be quite strong.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.120]   We talked about this in a previous
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.400]   episode, feedback is something we're
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.760]   wired to take seriously.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.960]   So if you're a journalist who uses
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.160]   Twitter as your primary tool, like 69%
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.440]   of US journalists do, you're constantly
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880]   working with this digital sword of
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.000]   Damocles hanging over your head.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.160]   What if I say the wrong thing and
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.080]   really upset the crowd on Twitter?
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.360]   What if I miss out a particular
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.760]   caveat or don't mention this other
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.080]   factor that could be happening and I
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.040]   really get swarmed on by other people?
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   This is anxiety producing, this is
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.720]   nerve wracking, and it really can push
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.040]   coverage in certain directions.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.840]   Certain issues are never talked about
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.480]   or other issues are drowned in all
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   sorts of defensive maneuvering.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.720]   So there is all of these negative
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.600]   side effects, both what you see and
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.720]   how you worry about people seeing you
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.560]   if Twitter is the main thing you use.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   Most people don't use it.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.840]   Journalists do.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.000]   So it's an interesting separation.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.880]   There is, however, something new I
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.440]   want to remark about, new to this show.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.000]   I think it's significant.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.480]   And I don't quite understand this well,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.320]   but I want to put a preliminary
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   stake in the ground here.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   Let's look at the right side of this chart.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.800]   So the sites that US adults in
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.680]   general use to get news, look at number two.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.240]   YouTube.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's the second most used site by
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.920]   US adults to obtain news.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.800]   So what's going on with that?
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.080]   Well, I think what this might
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.720]   be reflecting is generational.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.680]   There is, I think for the younger
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.520]   adult generations, what I guess you
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.200]   might call Gen Z and the younger
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.640]   millennials, a shift towards YouTube
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.320]   being a replacement for what my
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.200]   generation would have used cable for.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.760]   That YouTube has become your source
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.920]   of television style entertainment.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   And so why are you getting a lot of
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.040]   news from YouTube because that's where
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.160]   I watch shows putting quotation marks
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.920]   around because they look very
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.800]   different than they did before.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.960]   But if I want news, maybe I'm looking
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.320]   at breaking points or Kyle Kalinsky,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.120]   or if I'm on the other side of the
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.360]   political spectrum, you know, Ben
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.400]   Shapiro or what have you, but this is
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.960]   actually where I think a whole generation
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.880]   is going for relatively reasonably
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   produced video content.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200]   Now I think this is really significant.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.640]   I think it's really significant
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.160]   because it is a different game than
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   is being played by the real flashy
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.720]   players in the online digital
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.440]   attention economy.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   We're looking now at the war between
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.520]   Tik Tok and Facebook, and there's
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.640]   Instagram and there's Twitter.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.000]   And these are the platforms that are
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.560]   getting a lot of attention now, but
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   they're playing a different game.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.080]   Those platforms are playing what I
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.520]   think of as being the more short-term
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.800]   game of how do we get maximum
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.560]   engagement from people today?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.480]   How do we get you to put your eyeballs
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.200]   on this app as long as possible?
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.000]   And so Facebook adds this feature and
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   then Tik Tok tries something different
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.480]   and then Instagram tries to pivot and
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.360]   let's try to use reels here to be more
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.960]   Tik Tok like, and it's just fighting
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.000]   short-term to get people to glue their
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.680]   eyes to these screens and they're using
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.800]   user generated content.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   Most of it's not super high quality.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.640]   Fine.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.960]   YouTube, I think is playing a longer game.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.040]   It is looking at what happened when
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.960]   the web came along and it completely
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   disrupted and democratized the
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.560]   production and publication of text.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.720]   You used to have to be a newspaper or
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.680]   a magazine or a book publisher to have
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.560]   any sort of mass audience for text.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.280]   The web said anyone could do this now.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.320]   YouTube is doing this with video.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.360]   And I think it's a really important
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.200]   shift it's going to change long-term
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.120]   how we consume and produce video
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.840]   content away from the TV and towards
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.400]   these new sort of mediums that
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.040]   YouTube is experimenting with.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.400]   And I don't think the game is how do
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.080]   I do this addictive Tik Tok style
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.480]   experience that's going to get you
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.520]   glued to this as much as possible.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   I mean, maybe they care about
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   that in the short term, but the
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.640]   long-term impact I think of
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   democratizing video is going to be
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   a complete change of that landscape.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.800]   So we see hints of that in 22% of us
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.040]   adults getting their news from YouTube.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.160]   That's because YouTube is their TV.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.000]   That is their cable TV.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.120]   They don't go to CNN.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.600]   They go to a YouTube channel
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.720]   of someone they trust.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.000]   They want to know about, let's
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.760]   say the latest COVID news, instead
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.360]   of going to Fox news or MSNBC.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.840]   They will switch to something like
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.360]   John Campbell's YouTube page, a
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.440]   former nurse and instructor of nurse
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.920]   who has a YouTube page where every
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   other day, or maybe even every day,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.320]   he literally just takes the statistics
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.240]   of what's going on in UK in particular
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.600]   with COVID numbers, and he goes through
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.240]   them and the camera shows him the paper
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.640]   and he just ticks things off with his
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.040]   pen and just let's go through the numbers
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   and see what's happening.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.880]   2.5 million subscribers.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.480]   He had more people watching those
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.400]   videos than are watching the
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.800]   morning show on CNN.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.760]   So this I think is, is interesting.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.120]   And where is this all going to lead?
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.600]   Well, I honestly think the red
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   herring in this conversation, the red
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.080]   herring is the highly engaging, addictive
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.160]   TikTok style user generated, go straight
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.240]   into my brainstem type quick, quick,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.440]   15 second content.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.160]   What I think is going to emerge from
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.400]   the YouTube world is this medium
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.760]   level production value.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   Like, I think this is
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.840]   what's going to be important.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.200]   This is what is going to disrupt
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.160]   the television in particular, the
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.360]   cable television landscape, which is
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.280]   hundreds of billions of dollars of economy.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.520]   What's going to disrupt this is
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.040]   people creating videos, but not creating
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.920]   videos quickly with their phone to go
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.520]   to TikTok, but people who have some
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.440]   production value.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.480]   That they have a set, they have some
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.880]   good lights, they have some people working
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.000]   on it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's still a fraction of the cost of
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.320]   producing a half hour of standard
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.000]   terrestrial linear cable programming,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.600]   but it's, it's, it's good
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.840]   enough production values.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.120]   We saw that happen in the blogging
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   revolution. It was individual bloggers
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.120]   that gave way towards content sites.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.680]   You get the like buzz feeds and the
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.840]   slates and the vox that actually were
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.680]   replicating newspaper magazine quality,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.080]   but at a fraction of the production cost.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.120]   We're seeing that in audio,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.320]   what's happening in podcast.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.520]   We're seeing this large industry
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.800]   eating into and about the conquer radio.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.520]   But what are the shows
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.040]   that are doing this?
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.960]   Well, they have radio
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.200]   style production values.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.400]   I mean, there's a reason why we're in
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.320]   this studio, why we have all this
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.440]   equipment over here.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.200]   It's a lot cheaper than
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.560]   running an NPR affiliate,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.720]   but when you, you, you cross that
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.800]   uncanny Valley into production values
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.320]   that are close enough to professional.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.160]   That's when these democratized.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.560]   Channels for media production
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   become important.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.800]   And that I think is the, the important
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.960]   thing happening in YouTube is not.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.640]   My picture I took with my smartphone,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.920]   but the breaking point set where they
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.840]   have a pretty good lighting grid and
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.720]   they're using a $60,000 4k camera,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.560]   three camera system with a TriCaster
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.120]   so that you can actually display their
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.400]   show on a 4k large screen television.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.000]   And it looks the same resolution style
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.960]   as what's coming out of the TV studios.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.640]   $60,000 is a lot, but it's a fraction
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.120]   of what it pays to do cost to
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.280]   do a traditional cable show.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.040]   So anyways, there's this underlying
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.120]   trend I think is important.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.640]   YouTube is becoming the new TV
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.680]   for a bigger generation.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.800]   This is driving a crossing
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   of the uncanny Valley.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.160]   More and more democratically
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   distributedly produced video content
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.560]   is beginning to approximate the
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.320]   production values of low in television.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.040]   That I think those are the moves.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.680]   I think that really
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.840]   disrupt the media landscape.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.680]   So there's the whole engagement
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.280]   war happening with social media platforms.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.440]   Let's put that aside for now.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.560]   This I think is a trend that is also.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.320]   It's also worth keeping an eye on.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.440]   I mean, Jesse, that's
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.360]   why we're doing video.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.840]   I don't really know.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.840]   We don't really know what exactly
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.800]   we're trying to accomplish by having
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.320]   the reasonably lit studio,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.160]   a pretty good camera system,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.520]   you know, some good audio.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   But as you heard me say all along
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.960]   is I just had this instinct.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.400]   I think we should be there.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   I think things are happening.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.720]   I can't tell you.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.600]   I can't point to, oh,
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.520]   we're trying to do X,
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.400]   what this person is doing,
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.680]   and we can be there in six months.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.320]   But I think a couple of years from now.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.400]   There's some importance
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.360]   to being early on this.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.960]   It's the same deal you talked about
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.760]   originally when you, you know,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.960]   provided the justification
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.720]   for the YouTube channel and having.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   You know, your core ideas,
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.160]   those types of like your reading lists,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.640]   like you can get specific content
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.280]   where I've like you went to the podcast
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.600]   and go to minute 32.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.760]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.200]   To see Cal talk about books.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:41.840]   Whereas now you can
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   just send him the video.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.280]   It's like easy.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.480]   You can share.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.040]   And there's something about visual.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.640]   Like, why do people
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.200]   watch video of podcasts?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.120]   I had this conversation
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.760]   with a friend of mine.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   We went out to lunch and he's my age.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.080]   So he's like, I don't understand
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   why you would anyone
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.400]   would have a video of a podcast.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.920]   He's like, when are people,
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.000]   when are they listening to it?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.360]   And I was like, no,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.720]   people like to watch it.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.320]   It's funny.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.240]   I actually figured out when they do
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.680]   one of my buddies, Aton,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.360]   who I hadn't seen in a while.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.760]   He watches it in the gym.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.280]   So he has it on the gym.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.360]   And then he's like on a big TV.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.920]   And then he sent me a picture.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.680]   He's like, is that you?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.960]   And I was like, it is me.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.280]   So then he watches it when he works out.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.240]   I think a lot of people do that.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.600]   It's like people used to put TV on.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.200]   So why not?
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.800]   I think the sports radio
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.880]   people figure that out, right?
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   Especially like the early Dan Patrick,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.200]   Colin Coward, like they figured out
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.840]   people like to see you,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.000]   even if it's just they're
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.320]   in their studio with their fancy mic
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.360]   and they're just sitting there talking.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.400]   Something about it is just
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.880]   that was really compelling.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.960]   There's the, you know, the sports junkies
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.320]   is a morning sports show here in D.C.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.000]   They have they're now televised
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.440]   on the NBC sports network, right?
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.280]   It's just four guys
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.520]   around the table talking.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.720]   But that is like compelling television.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.520]   There's something don't underestimate,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.760]   you know, our attraction to the visual.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.840]   So I don't think the models there yet.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.960]   Like the obviously the monetization
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.640]   model is coming there for podcasts.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.360]   I mean, the ad rates are good.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.880]   Really good shows are getting bought up
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.240]   in the networks for real money.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   You know, people are making more on
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.800]   podcasts than they would have
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.880]   made in low end TV.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.600]   So like the model is there for podcasting.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.080]   YouTube, not really.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.400]   I mean, there's like the super
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   like professional YouTubers
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.680]   trying to do that, Mr.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.440]   B style.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.960]   I have millions and millions of viewers
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.240]   and trying to get that game.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.440]   But I think there's another video game
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.840]   that that hasn't emerged yet.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.360]   We're like high quality video
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.720]   approximating cable
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.560]   where the revenue is not from
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.120]   some incredibly low CPM
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.600]   automated YouTube ad,
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.520]   but from something else.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.080]   And maybe that's nothing
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.800]   to do with YouTube.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.440]   It's on private apps or networks.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.720]   But I mean, I think there's something.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.640]   Well, even on Tyler
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.920]   Cohen's podcast recently,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.640]   he was talking to Horowitz
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.840]   and what's the partner's name?
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.360]   He's talking to the partner
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.240]   and they were talking about
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.800]   how Andreessen Andreessen.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.440]   Mark Andreessen.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.560]   And he was talking about how the economic
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.400]   model for podcasts
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.320]   actually isn't there yet.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.640]   Well, he's like it's
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.360]   starting to get there, but it's still.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.480]   He was explaining he does a much better
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.520]   job of explaining than I did,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.760]   but it was pretty cool to listen to.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.440]   Yeah, because I know two people, not well,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.760]   but just like have crossed paths
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.840]   with them or talk with them.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   Who in the last year or two are
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.760]   have done seven figure deals.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.520]   For podcasting.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.280]   I mean, the interesting thing about that is.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.560]   Like in writing, for example,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.120]   which has been around forever,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.360]   seven figure deals are very, very hard
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.160]   and they're very, very rare, right?
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.560]   I mean,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.480]   the level of success
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.600]   you have to have in the world of writing
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.720]   in terms of where you rank
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.240]   among other writers to do seven figure
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.920]   deals is like really at the tippy top.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   These guys doing seven figure deals
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.200]   for podcast are not at that super elite level.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080]   It's not like, OK, these are the names.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.440]   I mean, if you're
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.320]   going to, if you're doing a seven
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.240]   figure deal for a book,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.640]   people know who you are.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.600]   These are not podcasters
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.560]   who people like, oh, yeah,
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.760]   I know that show, right?
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.520]   So there's something
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.240]   interesting going on.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.640]   I think it's a highly monetizable world.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.160]   It's the, I don't know, Jordan Harbinger
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.760]   and I talked about this when we did.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.880]   It's last summer, I don't know, I did.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.640]   I had him on the show a while ago
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.680]   and we got deep into
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   the economics of podcasting
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.480]   and we tried to get into this
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.200]   and I was kind of arguing
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.440]   that the peak of,
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.360]   you know, you can make a good living
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.080]   is actually way broader on that
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.720]   than in other things.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.120]   He kind of disagreed, but it was
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.160]   something interesting going on
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.440]   when I when I know two people.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.760]   Who's like if I
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.000]   grab someone on the street
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.480]   and said their name,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.360]   they don't know who they are,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.120]   but are doing these seven figure deals.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.880]   Something's interesting going on
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.320]   because in almost every other media,
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.840]   if you're doing seven figure deals
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.040]   at the very least,
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.000]   you're a popular host of a radio show.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   You're like you have
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.760]   you have a pretty good prime time,
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.520]   maybe early prime time cable news show.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.480]   Your your book is.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.680]   At the front of the bookstore
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.080]   at the airport and podcasting is.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.440]   Bringing people to that level,
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   it's similar to like Internet marketing,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.880]   how people kill it on the Internet,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.640]   you know, and like you can compare that
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.360]   to like a brick and mortar business and.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.720]   Right, some of these
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.960]   Internet marketers are.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.520]   You would see this simple website
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.840]   and it generates millions
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.800]   of millions of dollars a month.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.440]   It's yeah, you kind of told me
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.160]   about some of that world
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.200]   like the numbers are crazy.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.120]   Yeah, they're insane.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.080]   And forget seven, right?
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.760]   Talk eight figures or more, right?
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.440]   Some of them.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.200]   I mean, I mean,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.160]   it's really hard to figure out,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.360]   but if you figure it out, I mean,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   but even like the seven figure ones
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.560]   or whatever, I mean, that's doable.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.000]   You know?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.040]   Yeah. So it's interesting.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.320]   I love those trends.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.960]   So I think video like so
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   audio is getting there.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   Text never got there.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.760]   It was very the upper limit
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.160]   for monetizing democratized text
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   after the World Wide Web came along.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.560]   The upper limit there was
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.320]   the ceiling was relatively low,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.440]   like and Andrew Sullivan
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.760]   could get high six figures
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.600]   for the Daily Dish.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.560]   But it was a huge pain.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.920]   You know, it was a huge pain technically.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   You know, I think some people
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.680]   now with substack
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.280]   and can do like high six figures.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.840]   But it's like that's a ceiling
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.520]   for people who are
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.680]   at the very top of the game,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.960]   the very top of their pyramid.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.600]   Audio seems to be, you know.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.880]   Better like I could
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.280]   I could replace my Georgetown salary.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.760]   With what we're doing right now,
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.040]   which is a half day a week,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.680]   so that's like
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.920]   something's happening there.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.040]   And we see these people
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.080]   doing seven figure stuff
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.880]   and video, I think it's going to.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.000]   Maybe have an even bigger.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.360]   Yeah, I just don't think
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:40.920]   it's figured it out yet.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.840]   Obviously, YouTube ads is not
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.800]   what is going to monetize video
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.920]   in a meaningful way.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.200]   It's just the numbers aren't there.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.680]   It it only rewards virality
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.960]   and certain types of like content
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.760]   that serves to the algorithm.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.000]   Well, I think this could be monetization
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.120]   that gets free from the algorithm.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.840]   So we'll see.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.120]   That's kind of what Mark
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.840]   was talking about.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.960]   Right. So that's what he was.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.840]   I can't really explain it well,
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.960]   but I'd have to listen to it again.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.200]   But he was talking about some stuff.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.440]   This was so this was on
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.480]   Tyler Cowen's podcast kind of recently.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.080]   Yeah, I just listened to last week.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.880]   Andreessen and Horowitz were both.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.080]   It was just Mark.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.880]   Just Mark Andreessen.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.200]   Yeah. On the show.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.400]   Interesting. He reads a lot, too.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   You probably get along with him.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.560]   Never met him.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   You guys, I could tell you guys
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.040]   would be able to talk about a lot of stuff.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.720]   Well, speaking of talking about stuff.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.400]   Let's do a couple ads,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.800]   as that's what actually allows us to keep.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.200]   Speaking of monetization,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.760]   let's do a couple ads here
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.120]   and then we can get into some questions.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.880]   Let's start with Grammarly.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.520]   One of the oldest sponsors of this show,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.440]   I think they might have been.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.120]   I think they might have been
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.600]   the original ad read on Deep Questions.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.680]   I'm not sure, but if they weren't,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.000]   they were one of the first test ad reads
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.840]   we did to prove that
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   that we actually had an audience
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.080]   who cared about these things.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.800]   So you've heard me talk about Grammarly
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   for a while.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.040]   I'm a fan because I'm a fan of writing
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.120]   clear communication,
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.000]   whether you are sending an email
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.040]   or a report going to a client
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.600]   or a cover letter for a job application.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.320]   Clear communication is absolutely vital.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.960]   If you can communicate confidently,
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.600]   competently and clearly,
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.120]   it just reflects an organized,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.640]   competent, clear thinking mind.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.960]   It makes you a much more powerful,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.040]   puts you in a much more powerful position
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.960]   in the job market.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.040]   Grammarly can help you do that.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.720]   It's an all in one writing tool
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.560]   that helps you turn out
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.720]   clear, concise communication quicker,
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.440]   than ever.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.720]   And when you use Grammarly
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.320]   and its premium product,

[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.280]   which, by the way, you have to do.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.640]   You cannot have grammar
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   mistakes in your writing,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.280]   but it can do much more.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.080]   Are you trying to nail
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.160]   that perfect cold pitch?
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.520]   You can use Grammarly's free
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.280]   tone detector to make sure
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.560]   you're making the right impression.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.520]   Let's say you have an idea
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.080]   that you're trying to get out clearly.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.840]   This is the whole challenge for me
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.720]   when I do my writing,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.880]   especially New Yorker writing.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.440]   It's all about I have this idea
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.720]   and how do I get that out clearly?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.480]   This is a place where Grammarly can help
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   by doing clarity focused sentence rewrites.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.640]   You said this.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.760]   Redo the sentence this way.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.680]   Same meeting much clearer
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.480]   if you use Grammarly Premium.

[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.760]   These are kind of cool.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.560]   Your tone is this.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.760]   You want the tone to be like this.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.440]   Let's show you how to make changes to do that.

[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.160]   Now word from another sponsor.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.440]   Better help.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.120]   Think for a second about
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.000]   how much you care about
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.640]   taking care of your car.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.120]   Right?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   Imagine you had the same car
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.960]   for your entire life.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.120]   You would put a lot of effort in.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.440]   Let's keep this thing running.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.840]   Let's keep the oil change
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.320]   when the timing belt is getting old.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.920]   We want to replace them.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.360]   Well, we're stuck with our same brains
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.120]   for our whole life,
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.800]   so why aren't we treating them
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.480]   the same way?
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   How you care for your mind
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.920]   will affect how you experience your life.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.600]   So it's important to invest time
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.280]   and care into keeping our minds healthy.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.520]   And there are plenty of ways to do this.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.960]   You can challenge your mind
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.160]   by learning a new language.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.320]   You can take naps.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.640]   You can, of course,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.840]   listen to the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.080]   But you should add to the list.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.320]   Better help online therapy.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.920]   We live, as always, in challenging,
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   uneven times.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.080]   I talk to a lot of people
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.160]   who are struggling
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.080]   in the mental department.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.720]   Maybe it's anxiety.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.880]   Maybe it's depression.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.400]   Maybe it's a sense of pervasive overload.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.960]   Therapy can help.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.000]   Therapists are in a lot of demand right now.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.440]   The one that happens to be down the street
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.280]   might not have any slots open.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.400]   This is where it's great
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.240]   to have an option like Better Help.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.440]   It is an online therapy tool
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.320]   that will allow you
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.440]   to connect with therapists
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.320]   without actually having to be right there.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.720]   It does not have to be someone
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.320]   who is local.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.120]   So when you use Better Help online therapy,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.560]   you get video, phone
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.920]   and even live chat only sessions.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.080]   You don't even have to use the camera
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.120]   if you do not want to actually be seen
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.760]   by the other person.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.200]   Whatever makes you comfortable.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.760]   It's much more affordable
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.000]   than in-person therapy.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.520]   It gives you access to many more
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.840]   potential practitioners
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.960]   than doing traditional therapy
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.520]   where you're limited
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.120]   to your local neighborhood.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   You can be matched with the therapist
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.800]   in under 48 hours.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.680]   Our listeners get 10% off their first month
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.440]   at betterhelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.280]   So if you go to betterhelp.com/deepquestions,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.040]   one word,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.200]   you will get 10% off your first month.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:38.320]   That's betterhelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.160]   All right, let's do some
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.720]   questions of our own,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.280]   some questions of our own, Jesse.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.200]   I have two in a row
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   that are about children.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.000]   So I figure we'll do
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.640]   we'll start off our questions today
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.080]   with a child question block.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.360]   Our first one comes from Sarah.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.760]   Sarah says, I'm particularly fascinated
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.120]   in digital minimalism
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   from a parent's perspective.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.080]   I'm really concerned
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   about how my children,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.840]   the oldest of which is currently nine.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.680]   Sarah, by the way, my oldest is also nine.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.000]   So this is relevant.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.480]   I'm particularly concerned
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.640]   about how my children will navigate
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.480]   the digital world as they reach the age
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.680]   when they and their peers
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.440]   are likely to first obtain smartphones
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.280]   here in the UK, where we live.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.000]   This is generally
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.040]   as they start secondary school at age 11.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.520]   I'm equally concerned
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.960]   how they will navigate adolescents
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.120]   in the digital world we live now.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.200]   I'd really appreciate
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.320]   any information or advice
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.080]   you may have directed towards parents
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.880]   on this topic.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.480]   Well, Sarah, I do have some thoughts,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.080]   these are the thoughts
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.560]   that makes me very unpopular
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.160]   among a lot of young adolescents,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.360]   but I will give them to you nonetheless.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.840]   Here's my TLDR summary of
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   digital engagement and kids.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.600]   I would worry about
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.880]   giving unrestricted smartphone access
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.680]   to anyone under the age
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.160]   of, let's say, 16 or 17.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.000]   In other words, 16 or 17
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.520]   is probably the appropriate earliest age.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.200]   To give unrestricted smartphone
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.880]   access to a kid, certainly not 11.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.480]   There's a couple of issues
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.360]   here that are relevant.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.760]   I believe the evidence is becoming
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.200]   increasingly clear
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.760]   that social media use
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.440]   during early adolescence
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.560]   and during puberty or pre-puberty
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.520]   is really potentially
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.080]   psychologically quite damaging.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.160]   Now, your kid might be fine,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.040]   but there's a big chance
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:45.880]   that they won't be.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.120]   This is a danger zone.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.600]   Early adolescent girls in particular
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.200]   who do heavy social media use.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.640]   There's some real scary signals there.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.400]   But forget the debates
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.800]   about the research literature.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.280]   Social psych literature
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.040]   is very difficult.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.320]   It's very difficult to get clear
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.400]   signals on anything.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.200]   Just look at the target audience itself
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.440]   and see what they self-report.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.400]   I hear this again and again
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.800]   from young adolescents.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.600]   This is a source of anxiety.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.760]   This is a source of feelings of self-harm.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.960]   This is ruining my life.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.160]   All occasions pointing towards
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.480]   heavy social media use on their phone.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.240]   There's other issues
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   with unrestricted
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.880]   smartphone use as well.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.320]   Excessive video game
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.400]   playing is a big deal.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.920]   These games are very addictive,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.480]   especially those that are massively
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.600]   multiplayer online style games.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.080]   Give, for example,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.480]   a young adolescent male
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.040]   unrestricted access
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.280]   to games on their phone.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.760]   And you might get six,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.320]   seven plus hours of playing.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.600]   They'll play them into the night.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.080]   They'll show addictive tendencies
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.920]   where they can act out
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.720]   with anger or rage
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.200]   if the screen is trying
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   to be taken away from them.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.880]   Their brains are not ready for that.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.280]   I think that is really damaging.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.520]   The other issue is pornography.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.040]   You give unrestricted smartphone
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.760]   use to a 12 or 13 year old.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.560]   You are going to potentially generate
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.160]   some real issues
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.640]   with their developing sexuality.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.480]   You might also develop
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.440]   some real issues
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.720]   in how they actually relate to or treat
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.240]   with respect or not the opposite sex.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.400]   These are real issues.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.840]   And we shrug our shoulders at it and say,
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.360]   yeah, but.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.960]   The other kids are doing it.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.720]   And I don't think that's
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.160]   a strong enough rationale.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.240]   I don't think that's
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.080]   a strong enough rationale.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.200]   So what should you do instead?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.360]   At the appropriate age,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   get them a phone with text messaging,
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.040]   but does not have the standard OS
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.200]   that can run social media apps
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.000]   and unrestricted web browsing.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.600]   Get them a dumber phone,
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.440]   a feature phone that has text messaging.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.840]   Sure, that's useful.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.040]   That's very useful.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.600]   Text me when you're done with practice
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.440]   and you want to be picked up.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.680]   Let me text my friend and say,
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   I'm coming over now.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.560]   I think that's fine.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   I'm completely fine
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.200]   with that modern convenience.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.240]   I mean, when I was in high school,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   it was all about pay phones
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.400]   and we had a calling card numbers
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.040]   we had memorized and quarters
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.160]   and you would try to call
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.240]   and hope that your parent was there.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   And if not, you waited.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.880]   And that's not great
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   from a convenience standpoint.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.840]   So texting is fine,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.240]   but not unrestricted access
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.040]   to the web or standard apps.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.240]   What you also have to do instead
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.320]   is help encourage and guide your child
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.480]   so that they can find a social community
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.120]   aimed at some sort of
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.320]   common objective or goal,
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.400]   whether this is a theater
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.480]   troupe or a sports group or a band
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.600]   or a small fledgling teenage company,
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.520]   or they're in the first robotics club
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.480]   and in some sort of,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.880]   you know, a STEM style gathering,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.120]   whatever it is, but something
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   that they can be with other people
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.280]   and build up their skills
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   and feel the sting of defeat
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.400]   and enjoy the camaraderie of success
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.280]   when they do well
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.960]   and let this be the core
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.120]   of their social experience.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.440]   If you have successfully
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.280]   a group like this,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.840]   but you don't use social media,
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.240]   you'll be fine.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.000]   You're like, yeah,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920]   I have my buddies from the track team
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.600]   and, you know, they kind of rag on me
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.800]   because I'm not on TikTok or whatever
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.920]   or I'm not on Snapchat or whatever.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.360]   But like we have this bond
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.240]   and we do these things
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   and it's just like a quirk
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.720]   and you will be fine.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.160]   What you would want to avoid,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.000]   of course, is someone
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.800]   whose entire social identity
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.640]   is based just off of this digital world.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.440]   That's no good.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.480]   And if you're in that situation
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.560]   and take away that digital world,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.160]   you're isolated.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.760]   Yes. So we need alternatives.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.800]   And I think that's really.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.200]   That's really the key
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.600]   to making it palatable
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.400]   for a 12, 13, 14, 15,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.360]   maybe 16 year old
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.920]   not to have access to these phones
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.080]   is that they are entrenched
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.160]   in things that matter to them,
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.400]   to connect them to other people
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.720]   and give them meaning and forward drive.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.280]   That's what we're wired for.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.520]   That can satisfy it.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.480]   They will survive without it.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.080]   The only other point I want to say,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.040]   Sarah, is I picked up a strong current
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.720]   during my digital minimalism book tour.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.920]   I picked up a strong current.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.800]   From contemporary adolescence
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.440]   of a backlash against these companies.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.680]   And the last few years
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.480]   has seen this major
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.640]   social media backlash.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.720]   This is media backlash
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.840]   against social media.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.080]   Mark Zuckerberg has been transformed
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.000]   into a devil style character.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.400]   Twitter is raked through the coals.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.440]   This is all out there in the zeitgeist.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.120]   I don't think these these apps
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.320]   have the same atmosphere
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.080]   of countercultural cool that they used to.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   Now, the countercultural move is perhaps
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.160]   to say I don't use any of these things.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   Forget you, Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.600]   I'm not going to use your app.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.280]   Forget you, ByteDance.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.680]   Good for you for getting a billion users
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.960]   to TikTok in only four years.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.000]   I don't want to be a part
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.520]   of your attention mining factory.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.480]   There is a growing countercultural
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.920]   street cred in being someone
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.320]   who knows what you're about
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.400]   and you're 14 and you're
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   not on those things
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.600]   and you're killing it somewhere else.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.520]   And people like you,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.400]   that thread was definitely
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.600]   one that was growing.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.000]   And I think it's getting easier and easier
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.720]   to be one of those younger people
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.240]   who doesn't use these services.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   It's not seen as square,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.560]   I think, as much as it might be seen
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.520]   as forward looking.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.400]   So this is all going to get easier, Sarah.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.000]   So resist getting them a phone for now.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.840]   Hopefully by the time
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.040]   your nine year old is 11,
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.640]   it'll be considered quite standard
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.720]   the fact that you are not
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.920]   giving them a smartphone.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.120]   And even if it's not, you should resist.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.880]   I have a quick two questions, actually.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.720]   So in terms of getting
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.600]   the appropriate phone
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.080]   for just text messaging,
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.120]   when do you think that should be?
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.840]   I mean, I guess it's regional.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.760]   So around here, I don't know,
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.440]   it could be pretty early,
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   like around here, I know.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.360]   Nine and 10 year olds
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.040]   where they don't give them a phone yet,
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   but they give them these watches.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.280]   And the the watches allows them.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.760]   There's there's three numbers
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.680]   programmed into it that they can call.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.120]   So like you're
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.880]   typically their parents, right?
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.680]   And then you can do
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.400]   text messaging on the phone.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.920]   But I think it's pre-programmed text
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.840]   like a mom, my wife,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.280]   or you talk into it or something like this.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.200]   But again, you can only talk
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.560]   to a small number of people on it.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.840]   And it can also be a GPS tracker
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.800]   that your parents can use.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   And like around here,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.680]   these watches will sometimes be used
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.360]   to allow like to give more freedom
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.320]   to like a nine and 10 year old.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.680]   Like you can walk to school and back
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.440]   or go to the stores,
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.480]   because like if you have some issue,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.520]   you can just like press the button
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.240]   and it'll call me and I can come get you
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:21.800]   or something like that.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.120]   So there's these transitional things
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.400]   that I think are good
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.200]   in these close in city environments
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.400]   where people are otherwise worried
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.920]   to have their kids be completely free.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.720]   I don't know.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.640]   I mean, to me,
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.560]   text message available phone.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.120]   I mean, I'm thinking middle school.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.560]   I don't know if that sounds reasonable to you.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.480]   I mean, the kids you coach are older,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   right, their high school.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.880]   Yeah, they are.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.960]   So they're all, you know,
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.360]   plugged into the matrix.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:44.600]   Right.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.040]   One other question, though,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.600]   in terms of computers,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.200]   like getting kids on computers
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.320]   and doing that sort of thing.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.480]   Is there a crossover?
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.640]   Yeah, but I think
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.480]   the next question
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.360]   is going to be relevant to this.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.040]   I think it's good for kids
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.200]   to have access to computers.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.520]   But it should be in public.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.880]   Here is the family computer.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.760]   It's in the middle of everything.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.240]   As we go about our business,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.400]   you know, preparing dinner,
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.680]   this or that, we see what you're doing.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.800]   Don't have a computer in the room.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.560]   At least until, you know,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.240]   what in their room.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   You're 17 and you're a hacker and you're,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.920]   you know, you're going to go to MIT
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.280]   the next year and like, fine,
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   you can go do your computer hacking,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.200]   but you're 12, 13, 14 years old.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.840]   You want to go on like the Minecraft
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.120]   forum or whatever.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   And that's fine.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.440]   But I'm going to it's out here
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   and we're going to see what you're up to.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.840]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.640]   All right.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.400]   So here's a relevant related question.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.320]   This is from Sam.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.440]   Sam says, what is the appropriate age
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.480]   to get my child started
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   with learning to code?
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.880]   My boys are eight and four.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.000]   I want them to develop skills
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.160]   that can give them a great career.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.760]   Sam, eight is not too early.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.480]   I mean, if we're talking fundamentally,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.280]   where do you have to be
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.760]   to potentially learn to code?
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   You have to be comfortable
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.440]   working your way around the computer
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.440]   and computer interfaces,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.720]   and you have to obviously be
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.360]   a fluent reader and writer
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.720]   because code is words.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.800]   You got to understand how to do words.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.040]   I believe I started coding
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.960]   when I was probably.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.920]   Six or seven,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.600]   if I had to remember,
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.480]   I mean, I don't know exactly.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.880]   I just know when we moved
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.240]   from one place to another,
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   I moved after second grade
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.640]   from Houston to New Jersey,
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.000]   and I remember in Houston
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.320]   messing around some with coding
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.720]   on my mom's computer.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.200]   But really, when I was seven and eight
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.400]   in third grade is when I probably
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.000]   got more serious about it.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.560]   So if they're interested,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.960]   they can get their way
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.720]   around a computer.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.360]   They can read.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.280]   It's not too early.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.240]   Here is my hot take
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.720]   on teaching kids to code
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.920]   where I differ from other people.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.520]   I'm not a big believer
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.560]   in these dumbed down tools
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.200]   to help give you a, quote, unquote,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.120]   coding mindset that will then set you up
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.760]   to learn a programming language later.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.280]   I'm a big believer of
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.680]   start with a real language.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.800]   Do simple stuff at first,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.720]   but start with the real language
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.880]   and in your quest to want to do cooler
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.120]   things with that language.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.560]   That is what will stretch you
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.440]   to learn more and more.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.280]   So I was doing this
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.440]   some with my nine year old.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.400]   He was he was interested
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.280]   in coding at the time,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.520]   so I set him up with Python.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.400]   And we use and I would recommend
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.240]   using something like replit, R-E-P-L-I-T.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.320]   I think people I'm saying that wrong.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.360]   So my pronunciation is wrong,
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.960]   but it is a web based coding environment.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.360]   Cost a little bit of money,
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.520]   but you can just select
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.000]   whatever language you want to use
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.080]   and all the compiling
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.480]   and everything is happening
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.200]   and interpreting is
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.280]   happening on their servers.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.600]   So so you don't have to configure
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.920]   your computer and download
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.320]   the latest version of Python
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.240]   and find a development environment.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.000]   You just go to R-E-P-L-I-T.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.800]   I want to Python.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.480]   All the libraries are there.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.760]   Whatever language you want to do.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.520]   It's also a Google Docs
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.400]   style shared document paradigm.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.920]   So while your kid is on there,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.240]   you can be on a different computer
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.800]   sharing the same document,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.880]   seeing what they're doing
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.600]   and helping them edit it.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.760]   So just use something like that.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.560]   Start simple.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.440]   I taught my kid with some
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   game, a book,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.960]   showed him some basic stuff,
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.240]   and he was doing relatively simple
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.920]   text based games
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.560]   with some inputs and conditionals.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.520]   So it would like present a question
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.000]   and you could type in your response
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.240]   and then based on what you said,
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.160]   it would print out what happened next.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.120]   So he was sort of working on some basic
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.600]   conditional text based game logic.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.400]   He kind of lost interest,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.840]   but it was not a far step from there
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.040]   if he was really into it,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.800]   into building out
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.600]   maybe more of an engine
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   for those type of games
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.800]   than moving on the graphics,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.160]   maybe using something like pie games.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.960]   You would be surprised
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.200]   by how young people can.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.120]   Master relatively complex
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.600]   syntax and procedure,
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.560]   just they memorize
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.360]   and learn it pretty quickly,
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.440]   so use real languages.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.920]   They don't need blocks
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.160]   that they hook together
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.320]   and try to get the programmatic
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.680]   mindset, just use languages.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.560]   At least that's the way
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.960]   that's the way I did it.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.400]   You know, I don't code much anymore,
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.520]   Jesse, but I used to be
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.120]   kind of a coding nerd.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.200]   I can imagine coding nerd.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.840]   I knew a lot of languages.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.720]   Do you miss it now?
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.400]   Now, so I was I was like
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.440]   a I was a bit of a.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.680]   Computer guy,
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.640]   but I was also a guitar guy,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.720]   so I was also in bands
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.720]   and then I was a sports guy as well,
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.160]   like a track track
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.800]   athlete in high school.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.000]   I put on a lot of hats.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.960]   I move between a lot of circles,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.040]   but I always like coding
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.280]   and making video games.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.600]   I just learned a lot of languages.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.920]   I sort of started with basic
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.120]   and then you get some C
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.440]   and then you start writing
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.760]   more inline assembler.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.720]   And then when I was in early high school,
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   you can it's not too hard to learn
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.240]   how to hack the assembler language
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.160]   that runs on the Texas
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.480]   Instrument graphing calculators.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.240]   So if you can, if you can write
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.520]   in the underlying assembly
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.600]   language on those calculators,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.920]   you can touch the graphic memory
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.120]   directly and actually do.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.800]   So if you ever played
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.280]   like the actual real non text
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.960]   based games in your graphing calculator,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.280]   that's programming
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   directly in assembler language.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.880]   And so I programmed a game
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.160]   back then called punt return
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.000]   my big contribution
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.720]   to the world of programs.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.360]   And so it's a graphing calculator game
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.320]   in which you were a football player
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.240]   doing a punt return.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.800]   And so you were kind of
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.680]   on the bottom of the screen,
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.440]   but you would see the football field,
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.360]   the yard markers kind of scrolling past
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.240]   and defenders would come on the screen
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.680]   and you would have to maneuver
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.520]   your way around them.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.320]   And if you could get past
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.800]   enough defenders, you'd get the touchdown.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.440]   So that was my big
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.000]   that's my big contribution
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.760]   to the world of programs.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.440]   But then I went.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.040]   So with the undergrad
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.400]   was doing computer science,
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.720]   doing research,
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.960]   systems, the type of research
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.480]   and so doing some coding
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.680]   And then when I got to MIT, I just.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.520]   Decided I don't want to program
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.440]   and I joined a theory group
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.120]   and that was it.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.760]   And I stopped programming.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.880]   So we got the MIT
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.560]   joined a theory group
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.800]   and that was that was
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.880]   the end of my programming days.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   And so now I'm really out of shape.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:06.560]   I don't know.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.640]   I don't know the modern.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.080]   I mean, I do.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.200]   That's not sure I program
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   some games for my kids
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.520]   and Python and stuff like that.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   But I'm no I'm no coder.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.440]   So is the theory group
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.680]   in terms of computer science, is that like
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.520]   if you're a mathematician
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.800]   going to like applied math?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.240]   Yeah, I mean, they do have apply.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.120]   It has a porous boundary
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.400]   with the applied mathematics group.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.560]   At MIT, but
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.200]   yes, and all the financial guys
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.040]   use applied math and like stocks.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.760]   Yeah, so there's an applied math.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.320]   If you look at and I did recently,
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.080]   it was for my book for various reasons.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.480]   I was looking at recent hires
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.520]   in the the applied math department
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.360]   at MIT, and some of those recent
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.320]   hires are doing things
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.200]   that could just as easily
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.440]   be within the theory group
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.720]   in the computer science department.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.840]   So there is a porous border.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.600]   The theory group at MIT was so cool
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.800]   because there was so many.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.960]   So many world class famous minds
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   that were all just.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.880]   On the same floor,
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.960]   I talk about on the show sometimes,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   but it was still really cool
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.480]   thinking back like here's
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.200]   multiple MacArthur
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.040]   Genius Grant winners,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.640]   multiple Turing Award winners,
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.360]   the people who invented all the things.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.560]   Here's the guy who invented
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.680]   public key cryptography.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.200]   He's the R&R essay.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.880]   Here's the guy who became an MIT
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.160]   professor at 18 because he
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.840]   beautiful mind style
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.400]   proved this big thing
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.840]   about rigid geometry.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.240]   You know, when he was a teenager,
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.400]   you know, here's a person
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.440]   who invented that.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.200]   Here is the person who.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.120]   You know, innovative
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.360]   all a quantum complexity theory
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.320]   and is really cool.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.680]   Yeah, really, really cool.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.160]   Really interesting, really intimidating
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.880]   because it really concentrates just.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.680]   The superstars and MIT
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.200]   style of hiring is
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.800]   will wait till you're famous
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.600]   somewhere else.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.880]   You know, it was like
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.280]   you talk about this like a
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.960]   like the Lakers were
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.680]   in the 2000s or something.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.480]   Will wait till you're famous
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.520]   somewhere else and then you
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.840]   will bring you over here.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.000]   So is this all superstars?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Is everyone balls?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.160]   I told you about that book
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.480]   about Ed Thorpe I'm reading
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.760]   and when he was at MIT
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.280]   back in the 60s, he.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.480]   Claude Shannon was there.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.400]   Oh, Shannon's a cool.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.320]   And then they actually started
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.040]   becoming friends
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.400]   because Ed was doing all this
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.440]   like card counting stuff
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.320]   and he wrote that book
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.840]   and then they were building this like
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.440]   machine to like predict roulette
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.400]   like late at night.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.640]   It's it's pretty cool.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.600]   I got to read this book.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.680]   Yeah, Shannon's a cool guy.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.360]   Shannon must have been
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.480]   a grad student at the time
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.680]   because then he went on the Bell.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.880]   Now they were on the same age.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.080]   He was teaching, I think.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.120]   Oh, he was doing some teaching there.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.000]   Yeah, he was teaching there.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.320]   OK, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.400]   Shannon's an interesting character.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.460]   Master before his Master's thesis, he basically invented digital electronics
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.200]   That was his Master's thesis. So
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.080]   It was saying in the book
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.040]   it was talking about how he had these shoes that he would like put on and like
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:44.100]   He could walk on water and his neighbors like who is this guy's a weird guy. But so I'll
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:49.620]   Shout out to my friend Jimmy sunny's book mind at play
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.160]   It's fantastic Shannon biography mind at play
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.680]   Sonny has a new book out about the PayPal mafia called the founders also recommend that
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.340]   But mind at play I like that book. So I'm a Shannon fan
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:09.020]   All right. Let's do some more questions. I got one here from Patrick not about children
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:17.580]   Figure we get a quick one in here Patrick says what are your suggestions to widen the vocabulary of a non-native English speaker for scientific?
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.680]   writing
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:26.760]   Well reading is probably the best way to do this. You want to read as much science related writing as you can
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.320]   I would probably focus more on science journalism
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:36.000]   So books written by good science journalists than I would actually scientific papers
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.080]   A lot of scientific papers are written pretty poorly, you know scientists have other things on their mind. You're actually going to pick up probably better
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:47.640]   Writing habits from science adjacent writings of reading a good science journalist
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.960]   I'd read as much of that as possible and then write as much as possible
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.520]   specifically trying to deploy
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.640]   rhythms turns of phrases techniques that you're seeing again and again in these
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.880]   Award caliber science journals and books trying to deploy some of that in your own writing that stretches where you're going to get better
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.180]   But it's all an exposure game read read read read read right right right right right back and forth back and forth
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.680]   That's the feedback loop that's going to make you better
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.760]   All right, let's do a call I
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   Think we have a call here Jesse that
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.440]   It's gonna set up an even bigger topic I want to discuss okay, it sounds good
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:32.140]   Hi Cal, my name is Vito. I'm an engineering manager at the tech company as an engineering manager
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:37.280]   I have a lot of meetings and my calendar is always full. I'm having a hard time
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.660]   Controlling this spiraling calendar and I would like to ask you. What do you think I could do?
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:47.540]   I will have a lot of meetings. It is a part of my job. I cannot avoid right now
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:52.320]   I'm having full days with back-to-back meetings and it is often the case that
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.880]   Meetings will be scheduled right after one another
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:02.200]   I do have a good a good scenario here that I control a lot of these meetings and when they happen and I can
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.620]   Reschedule them a lot of them not all of them, of course
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.320]   But a lot of them I can't so I do have some control over the duration of these calls
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.240]   When do they happen if they meet up against each other or not?
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:20.740]   So I would like to ask you what what is your suggestion on controlling this calendar? Should I have a little bit of time?
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:25.820]   Between every every meeting should I schedule a lot of them together so that I have
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:33.840]   Bigger blocks on other parts of my day or maybe other parts of my week and then I have some days full and others not
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:39.240]   How would you handle a situation where your calendar is full and you need to have a lot of meetings?
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:46.940]   But you can move them around a little bit. What what you're taking this? Well, I mean Victor meeting overload is a perennial problem
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.160]   I think it's a problem that is worse
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.220]   These days than it's ever been before. So it's a good excuse to talk about meetings now
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.520]   probably the best advice here is to
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.060]   Be really weird in
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.500]   an unsettling way
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.620]   But not a way that you know directly is going to get you fired
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.480]   And then people just aren't going to want you in the meetings
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.740]   This is what I'm going to suggest and I think this is this is going to be the solution to your problem Victor
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   I want you to come into each of those meetings
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.460]   with a squid a
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.580]   Squid on your head
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.980]   Don't really mention it just you come in you're in the meeting
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:32.140]   Maybe it smells a little bit weird and then just throughout the meeting keep breaking in the volunteer to say can I tell you what?
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.260]   I really
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.260]   really hate
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:41.020]   Squids and just kind of keep bringing that up and then you know, someone else be talking and then and you just say, you know
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.900]   beady eyes
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.900]   that devilish beak
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.460]   Satan spawn they are
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.540]   Yeah
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.280]   Squids we could do without I'm telling you do this enough the squids on your head
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.840]   Maybe sometimes you come in with a fishing rod, but like you don't talk about it do this long enough and people like no Victor
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.700]   We're cool. We'll
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.960]   We'll email you the notes like you don't worry about it
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.680]   Like it's it's really gonna it's nothing because it's not it's unsettling, but it's not like an HR violation, right?
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.680]   Like you're not you're not coming in there and being like, let me tell you what I hate about people with red hair
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   It's squids, you know
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.920]   This doesn't work. If your boss is a squid actually, okay. Let's let's let's be more serious here
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.260]   I want to use this as an excuse to go through
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.080]   my standard toolbox
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.660]   For taming meetings
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:37.960]   There's multiple different tools that can be deployed to tame meetings in exactly Victor situation a situation where you can't just not go to meetings
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.040]   And Victor is really clear about this here. I can't not do these. I can't not do these
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.420]   Don't tell me to stop do these I can't not do these great
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:49.000]   A lot of people are in that situation be it in their office or over zoom, but it's lots of meetings
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.200]   I have a toolbox. I'm gonna give you this toolbox
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.880]   And you can pick and choose
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.880]   Which of these things might work best?
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.520]   So these are all things I've written about before but I'm gonna bring them all together. I
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.480]   Have four ideas to share
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.280]   All right idea number one
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.160]   meeting
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:14.440]   Buffers, so the meeting buffer method is all about working with your calendar in a slightly smarter way
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.520]   and here's how it works if you have to set up a meeting and
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:23.680]   You know how long that meeting is going to be so often meetings have hard stop for it's a it's one hour
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.040]   That's the hard stop. Don't just block out that hour on your calendar add
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.720]   15 to 20 minutes to that block
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:38.120]   So it's not just if the meeting is supposed to be from 1 to 2 you have 1 to 2 15 or 1 to 2 20
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.160]   actually blocked off on your calendar and
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:48.840]   If your calendar is public everyone sees that as what's blocked off if it's not public you just treat it like any other meeting
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.440]   I'm next available at 2 15
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:57.800]   I'm next available at 2 20 what you then do with this 15 to 20 minute buffer period is that is where you process?
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.560]   Everything that came up in that meeting to get it out of your mind
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.120]   To take the small steps through the small tasks that could be done right away
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:12.320]   The capture in whatever systems you use the longer term tasks. It is how you clear out the mental buffer before the next meeting
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.200]   this is important because this is a
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.120]   Its absence can create one of the real killer issues of a heavy meeting schedule
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.080]   Which is you get into a meeting it generates new obligations and plans and things that's all up
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.240]   There's open loops and you go straight into the next meeting
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.640]   You haven't dealt with those open loops yet, and now new ones are being generated is very stressful
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:37.080]   Our minds hates it. We want to shut the door on one thing before we move to the other meeting buffers is going to
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.640]   make you feel
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.960]   50% less anxious about a meeting filled day small hack goes a long way
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.400]   All right
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:50.480]   So what I'm going to do here is I go through these these tools each one is going to get a little bit more aggressive
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.800]   Be a little bit more radical
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:53:00.720]   Than the one that follows so meeting buffers is number one. Let's now ratchet up the stakes here with tool number two
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.920]   Which is the one for you one for me approach to meeting scheduling?
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.960]   Here's how it works. If I'm putting a meeting on my calendar, I
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:17.080]   Need to then within one week of that date. So let's say five workdays
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:23.300]   Schedule an equal amount of time that is protected time for me to just work without distraction
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.280]   You want to put an hour-long meeting on my calendar for Monday?
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.500]   I'm gonna find some time on Tuesday where I'm gonna break schedule an hour-long
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:35.340]   Work block deep work block for me and I don't say deep work block. It could be whatever
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.300]   It could be a just get my act together go through my inbox
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.820]   Just take a breather and try to organize everything that's going on
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.820]   I don't care what you do in it, but it's a non meeting block
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:47.300]   One-to-one ratio is the default application of this tool to our meeting here
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:50.780]   I have to find two hours later in the week that I protect and when it's on my calendar
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.500]   I treat it as a meeting with myself
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:58.020]   That time is no longer available for other people to come and take it now as other meetings fill into your calendar
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.980]   You might have to try to fit these in elsewhere. But what you'll end up with is
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.900]   enforcing a
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.020]   Predetermined ratio of meeting the non meeting time and so I like the one-to-one ratio
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.560]   One to one every minute in a meeting gets a minute of protected time. I like that ratio
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.460]   You might use different ratios depending on what you do for a living
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:22.660]   If you're an executive that is almost always in meetings. That's where most of your work happens
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:28.620]   Maybe it's a two to one ratio. So for every meeting you you schedule half that length in
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:35.340]   Undistracted time for yourself somewhere else in your calendar on the other hand, maybe if you're in a more
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:42.520]   Concentration forward position. It's a one to two ratio for every hour of meeting here. I'm gonna find two hours somewhere else
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:47.060]   But anyways, the key here is you're being intentional about what ratio you want your time to be
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:53.660]   collaborative versus individual concentration and you're taking advantage of the calendar and
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:59.380]   The social and professional convention around this time is blocked. So it's not available to actually enforce
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.180]   that ratio
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.900]   All right idea number three
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.940]   Again, let's ratchet up a little bit
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.980]   wage war on quote-unquote
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.940]   standing meetings
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.580]   Now in academia, this is a killer. I think this is killer in a lot of other places as well
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:24.260]   It is people who are who have been assigned. Okay, we're working on this obligation
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:29.740]   Here is a project that you know me and Jesse and this other person have been assigned to work on
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:34.580]   This is an open obligation. I'm stressed. Like how am I gonna make progress on this? I
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.280]   Don't listen to Cal Newport, so I don't do multi-scale planning
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:44.040]   What is the easiest thing you can do in that moment to assuage your anxiety about making progress on a project?
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.600]   You say I know what we'll do. All right, Jesse. All right other guy
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.940]   standing meeting
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.980]   Let's just get a meeting on repeat
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:56.460]   So we know at the very least every week Tuesday at 2:30 that we get together on zoom and we talk about this thing
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:02.480]   And now I can be like who this will be, you know, not forgotten because I trust meetings on my calendar
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.920]   This can completely take over your calendar with all of these different standing meetings one for everything
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:12.740]   You're working on where the actual amount of useful collaboration that happens is often very little
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:19.400]   Like sometimes the meetings a forcing function for you to do something but it clogs up your calendar. It's a big source of calendar
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.000]   congestion
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   So wage war on them
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.080]   replace standing meetings
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.000]   with much more
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.640]   Concrete processes for how you're gonna make progress on this specific project
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.400]   So you don't say let's just meet Tuesdays at 2:30. You say well, okay
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:42.020]   What is the next thing that needs to happen here? We need a draft of this client report with some commentary great
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:48.840]   Jesse you have the ball here write that report you write that draft once you have a good draft
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:55.120]   Put it into this Google Doc in this folder like a shared doc where we can see it
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.120]   Send us a note to say it's ready. That will start a
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.000]   24 hour timer for us to look at it get it done this week and
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Look, I have a standing office hours on Fridays
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.100]   That will be the time like if I have any big questions, you have any big questions come meet me there
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.160]   I don't know. I'm thinking about this out loud. But my point is it's specific and it's concrete
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.520]   What is the next thing that has to happen for this project? Okay, who's doing it? How do they signal they're done?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.000]   What happens after they're done? How do we get to the next step? So it's not just let's meet again next Tuesday
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.960]   It's let's do this specific work. And here's how it's going to unfold so replacing standing meetings with concrete
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:39.040]   project specific processes for how you're going to get to the next step is way more effective than let's just get on zoom every week and
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.400]   Small talk for a while and then kind of make excuses for why we didn't get things done
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.160]   All right. So the the last thing I want to
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.040]   recommend for waging or tackling meetings ratcheting up again is
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:55.480]   office hours plus reverse meetings
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   Office hours are great
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.440]   Regular times that you are available this time on these days. I'm always available. You can come into my office
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.440]   My phone is on I have a zoom window open if you're in a hybrid environment
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.040]   No appointment necessary. Come grab me. That is great on its own
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:18.120]   It allows for example small issues to be taken care of without having to have a synchronous back-and-forth
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.480]   Conversations or hold dedicated meetings just stop by my office hours and we'll chat about it, right? That's great
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:31.320]   But it can be used to implement this more aggressive notion that I call the reverse meetings concept
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.760]   Subscribers to my newsletter have heard me talk about this a
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:41.260]   Little chance for a plug by the way, if you don't subscribe to my newsletter, you should Cal Newport comm I've been writing that since
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:47.400]   2007 roughly one article per week about all the types of stuff I talked about here plug ended
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.000]   So the reverse meeting concept
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.320]   Leverages office hours in a way that I think is quite powerful. Here's how it works
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:59:00.120]   The standard way meetings unfold is I need your help this three or four people's help on something. I'm trying to work on
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:06.500]   I need some input. I need to assign them some tasks. The standard thing to do is I'm gonna organize an hour-long meeting
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:11.360]   So now six of us have to give up an hour of our time
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.400]   To come to this meeting so that I can make progress on this thing that I'm trying to work on
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   So that's six total man hours of time obligation generated by a meeting
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.000]   Reverse meetings leverages office hours to significantly reduce that footprint
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.840]   It says okay if I need help feedback or assignments from each of you five or six people to make progress on this meeting
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.120]   I am going to go to each of your office hours one by one. I will come to you
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:40.960]   I'm not gonna force you all to come to me and take this time on your schedule. I'll come to you in
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.600]   Time you've already put aside for types of quick discussions and with each of you all
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.000]   Hey, what do you think about this? Could you take this on?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.320]   Now let's say on average I talk to each of you for 10 minutes
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.480]   Now it's less convenient for me because your office hours might be spread out
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:59.520]   So I have to take three days and remember to go to talk to each of you. The onus is on me
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.400]   I have to do more work
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.240]   But let's look at the total man hour footprint of what just happened
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:11.120]   before we had six people spending an hour six total hours of time being taken away from other types of pursuits in
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.640]   This stand in this setup
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:20.000]   It is significantly less. There's me doing 10 minutes with five other people
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.480]   So if we want to add that up
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:29.520]   We do 50 minutes times two because it's the time I'm spending the time you're spending so now we're less than two hours
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.920]   We're closer to an hour and a half total footprint. So we've reduced this footprint by a significant amount
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.120]   We have also made the life easier for these other five people
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.520]   Me coming to your office hours
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.400]   We are already there taking calls and having people coming in and chatting with you for 10 minutes is a no op
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.240]   In terms of an impact on your schedule. It was time. You'd already set a time for that
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   that's such a less of a
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.200]   injury to
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.240]   Your schedule than you having to actually put aside a full hour that you've now lost
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.400]   Outside of your office hours to doing this discussion
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.800]   the only person who maybe has to do slightly more work in this is me because I have to
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.040]   Coordinate and go to each of you and spread out my meeting over multiple days, but you know what good
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.640]   It should be harder to call a meeting than it is
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.520]   You know the person generating the meeting should do more work than the people who have to attend
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:20.600]   So use office hours as the foundation for doing reverse meetings
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.200]   There's so much that can get organized without having to actually put aside extra bespoke
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.280]   periods of conversation for each individual project that some conversation
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.800]   requires
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:37.960]   So that's my tool that's my toolkit meeting buffers one-to-one ratio one for you one to me on your scheduling
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   Replace standing meetings with concrete
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:47.840]   Progress and process and use office hours to switch from standard meetings to reverse meetings all of those things
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.520]   Will really help
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:57.640]   There you go. It's a great thing about summer for professors Jesse is meetings go away. No more meetings. They no more meetings
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:06.440]   And no more meetings for you this fall either right? Well, no meetings. So much not teaching. I saw meetings. Yes a summertime summertime
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   I'm off the clock
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.760]   To go to the meetings. Well, but like summertime, I'm not a professor. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So like in summertime, I pay my own way
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.240]   I'm on a 10-month salary at Georgetown. Yeah, so I can do whatever this fall. I'm on teaching leave
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.000]   So I don't have to teach what does save a lot of time, but it's not
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.040]   It's also just normal
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.600]   Academic life still happens meetings and this and that and I don't think they're gonna put up with and rightly so
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.640]   I think we're probably past that period where it's like
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.960]   I'm just gonna have to zoom into this faculty meeting
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.200]   Because uh, you know the virus or this or that I think we're probably past those point now everyone's had cope at three times
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.640]   I think like we're probably going to be back to
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.200]   You got to come in, you know, the Dean wants to meet with you. You're coming to meet with the Dean
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.920]   We're having a faculty meeting
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.600]   You're coming in for the faculty meeting. I mean, maybe not. I don't know academia slow about that stuff
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.920]   I think a lot of the other professors were probably pushed back to so you wouldn't be alone. Yeah. Well if anyone asks
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   I'm incredibly worried about
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.040]   It's a promise for fat I could say I'm incredibly worried about picking up
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:15.440]   Kovats I can't come to the meetings, but we've been teaching in full classrooms for for a long time at this point
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.760]   So it's it's kind of hard to argue that like the thing I'm really worried about is the 20 minutes
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.400]   That's mean you in an office not the 50 kids that I'm lecturing to
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.720]   But I'll be good I've missed the campus is nice. It'll be nice because I build days around it
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.360]   Yeah, you can be a camp gym - yeah, I can use a bro. I am I can work in their libraries
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.440]   It's like a nice. Yeah, it's change of environment. It's a sweet campus. It really is nice. Yeah
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.040]   All right. Well speaking of nice if you are
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:49.240]   Looking for a new doctor and you don't know where to look who takes my insurance
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.520]   Who does people trust and you're not quite sure how to do this?
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.000]   You need Zoc doc
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.360]   You've heard us talk about Zoc doc comm on this show on multiple occasions EOC DOC
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.080]   It's a free app that shows you doctors who are patient review take your insurance and are available
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.720]   When you need them on Zoc doc

[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.040]   You know, I now have two different
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.560]   doctors in my life to use Zoc doc my
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.640]   Primary care physician and my dentist both use the Zoc doc comm
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.360]   So I think that is

[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.640]   Trying to think what would be the hardest quip here would be let's say you got a doctor
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.440]   named Tom Tom Knox
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:14.320]   I got my doc Tom Knox and Zoc doc comm
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.640]   Trying to go would be the most challenging possible
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.200]   Read here my doc Tom Knox on Zoc doc comm
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:32.400]   That's it on a dot matrix that's like a bill Burr I had right there. Yeah. No, I think bill Burr would then yeah
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.640]   Hair the company. Yeah, we really go after the company. I heard him on Tim Ferriss's
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.000]   Television show Tim Ferriss has a television show
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.520]   It's like on
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.240]   Direct TV. I did not know that. Yeah, I saw that he's recently on an episode again
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:56.000]   He's been on before so that bill Burr episode of Tim Ferriss is the audio from Tim's television show fearless and you can watch it
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.120]   Oh tube. Okay, like a huge studio with like an audience. Yeah, and it looks like he did that show like several years ago
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.320]   So maybe been reposting a lot of those so you think this is a repost?
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.680]   It's gotta be because I think because he's been I mean, I've listened to a bunch of those first ones
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.080]   I think the fearless he did like three or four years ago. Yeah, but so what we're trying to say here is that
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:21.000]   Bill Burr bill Burr support Zoc doc comm in particular his doc Tom Knox
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.600]   That bill Burr found on Zoc doc comm
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.720]   So that's ZOC doc comm slash deep Zoc dot
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.920]   Zot doc comm slash deep. I almost got it. Perfect. Jesse. I made one mistake
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.480]   One mistake, but pretty good. Let's also talk about eight sleep
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:48.000]   Listeners from last week know eight sleep is the ultimate game changer for good sleep
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.080]   because it allows you to control the temperature of your sleeping environment you put on the eight sleep pod cover and
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:03.560]   You can adjust the temperature of your mattress from being as cool as 55 degrees to as hot as a hundred and ten
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.280]   degrees Fahrenheit
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.240]   clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery a
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.240]   32% improvement in sleep quality and
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.240]   34% more deep sleep. I am a I need coldness to sleep
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.840]   So I am a big eight sleep fan if I can make my mattress cool
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.140]   I am happy as I threatened last week
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:34.520]   I'm gonna start wearing my eight sleep Pro Pod cover to the podcast draped around me set to 55 degrees
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.320]   So I can be cool. I'm gonna bring it to my classroom at Georgetown as well
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.080]   Heat is not something I love so I am a fan of
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.920]   eight sleep
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.700]   So go to eight sleep comm slash deep
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.920]   To redeem exclusive 4th of July savings and start sleeping cool this summer
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:01.560]   It sleep currently ships within the US Canada and the UK as well as select countries in the EU and Australia
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.040]   That's eight sleep comm slash deep
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.920]   All right, what do we got here
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.000]   Do a couple more questions
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.240]   Now let's check out our time. Let's do a couple more questions here
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.000]   This one comes from Maria
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.800]   Maria says my goal is to read more. I
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.540]   Replace checking my phone with reading books. However with more technical books. It's hard to jump in and out
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.700]   So I find I struggle to make progress
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.900]   If I only have five to ten minutes such as waiting in a line
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:38.900]   It takes some time to remember where I left off conceptually and I have to reread a couple paragraphs before I know
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:44.660]   What specific point is discussed and by the time I have caught up I need to put the book down
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.660]   well Maria, I like that you are using a
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:54.540]   Higher quality cognitive alternative to just looking at your phone when you're bored in line
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:09:02.980]   Reading is a great option. The solution to your particular issue with this strategy is don't read highly technical books in this context
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:07.800]   Different activities are better suited for different situations
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.620]   So if you're reading in line
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:16.960]   Novels as well as episodic or biographical nonfiction. This is really good for jumping in and out
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.020]   I usually have some sort of biographical or episodic nonfiction
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:25.180]   I'm listening to on audible so I can turn that on when I need to go
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:30.260]   Whatever put my laundry in one of these quick five to ten minute things. I mean I find
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.900]   Business biographies for example where it's you know, the story of whatever
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:44.260]   Universals rise or the CBS's moment of success during the early 2000s
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.240]   Those are really well suited to jumping in and out because when I say episodic, I mean they're talking about this show
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   They're talking about this thing that happened. They're talking about that thing that happened. It's sort of individual stories
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.420]   You can come in and out you don't have to keep up with highly technical things
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:02.220]   Novels can be the same way is jump back in into the action is interesting. Tell you you jump back out
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:08.500]   If you're reading in line, you might also consider our good friends over at mouse books
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:17.440]   This is a product that I like quite a bit. I've known Brian and Dave in particular for a long time now mouse books
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:24.220]   Produce these pocket size condensed or abridged versions of famous books or short stories. They are
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.380]   Look like a field notes notebook
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.180]   If that's useful, I think they might use the same printer who does the field notes notebooks
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.700]   So anyways, it's a little bit smaller than a standard smartphone
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.520]   The idea is you can have that in your pocket whenever wherever you have your phone
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.220]   So in any instance when you would pull out your phone you pull out a mouse book
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:45.040]   Instead so I think that's a cool way to have some more
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.860]   erudite exposure to the world of literature and philosophy while you're waiting in line
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.060]   Anyways good for you good for you
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.040]   And the reason why I don't want you to look at your phone in that situation is not that there's bad
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.300]   It's just by default bad. It's not the phone that is bad. It is these
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.980]   attention economy companies that dwell on your phone and
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:11.060]   Can play your brain stem like a harpsichord the tick tocks of the world the instagrams of the world the Twitters of the world
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.940]   That just gets its hooks into your brain. That's what I want you to get away from being the default
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.060]   So, you know if you're if you're taking out your phone to work on a wordle, I don't think that's so bad
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:25.020]   but if you're slack job the drool coming down the side as your
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.180]   TikTok videos not good for you
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.580]   Alright, let's do one more thing. Let's end here with a call Jesse. There's one I thought was
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.540]   Potentially kind of interesting. All right, sounds good
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:45.180]   Hi Cal, it's Hattie from Toronto Canada. Thank you for all your hard work. I really appreciate it
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.540]   the question I wanted to ask today is
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.620]   given
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.620]   most people's inability to
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:58.900]   Change the way they think and do things and take on high quality leisure and focus time
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.780]   I've realized more recently after doing the Clifton strength test
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:09.220]   That not everybody possesses the skills to focus think big picture
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:16.380]   Consume high quality content really think about everything that you talk about. So I'm starting to think that there are
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.620]   characteristics that make people
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:26.340]   More able to adjust to your way of thinking to really get an edge on everybody else
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.860]   and so I was just wondering do you have any advice for
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:37.900]   Helping people who don't naturally gravitate towards focused work to do more of it to consume better
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:45.460]   Media to get less distracted because I think it comes easier to some than it does to others. Thank you so much Cal. Bye-bye
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:51.500]   Well, howdy, it's a good question. I agree with parts of your premise and I vehemently disagree with other parts your premise
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.460]   So I think this will be productive to discuss a quick aside
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.860]   The Clifton strength finders is interesting. It's an interesting backstory
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.340]   Interesting backstory there. So it was Don Clifton
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:08.220]   This would have been much earlier in the 20th century was really an innovator in using
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.740]   Quantitative data
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.380]   To make predictions or assessment. So the his strengths finders was a good example
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:22.180]   You take this test and the numbers are crunched. They can tell you what your strengths were
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.380]   They were also really ahead of the game on employee satisfaction
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.540]   We we run this survey by your employees and it crunches down to a number we can figure out
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:34.140]   You know who is unhappy who is they could do this with customer satisfaction really well
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.140]   Let's give this standard survey
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.740]   We crunched the numbers and get a score that tells us are your customers happy?
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.460]   Did this latest change make them more happy or not? So Don Clifton was really ahead on that
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:50.580]   Our families had lots of interesting intersections with that the Clifton family really quick aside
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:56.580]   All right, so Don Clifton starts this company survey research international sri based out of Nebraska
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:00.900]   in the late 1980s they buy
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:04.860]   market research company in Houston, Texas
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:10.820]   where my dad was one of the partners and then soon after sri bought
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.060]   Gallup and
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:21.020]   they they took my dad from the market research forum in Houston and put him in charge of the Gallup poll and
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.820]   so I grew up kind of surrounded by the
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.300]   the Clifton legacy
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.460]   Don son Jim Clifton until recently was the the CEO of the company
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.220]   They took the name Gallup, but it used to be sri
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.820]   And so I've run into the Clifton's quite a bit and grew up hearing about all these Clifton products
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.420]   They're very interesting. Don Clifton was really ahead of the game. All right, that's an aside
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:46.780]   I want to push back on your premise that well, you know, some people just aren't suited
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.740]   to focusing or consuming
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.420]   high quality
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.620]   Information or doing high quality leisure. I don't agree with that. I
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:00.420]   Think that's like saying look some people just aren't suited for
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:06.380]   Eating good food and exercising like they just need to eat junk food and they can't really exercise
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.460]   That's not a fundamental attribute of a person
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:16.060]   You can move your diet towards better food. You can start exercising. You can get in better shape. You can eat better food
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:21.220]   Anyone has access to that so I I don't think that there is a fundamental
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.060]   Necessary
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:30.660]   Precondition aptitude to be able to do focus or to consume higher quality information or to do more higher quality leisure
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:35.300]   You do however have to get in cognitive shape to do so
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.300]   So if I look at you and you mainly eat terrible food and you never exercise
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:45.100]   if you went out and said here's what I did Cal I tried to go for a jog and
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:53.780]   It was terrible. I barely got very far before I was completely winded and I felt really bad and and I I tried to eat some
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.100]   You know
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.460]   Broccoli Robin and it just is like I don't know I had a hard time preparing
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.980]   I'm just not meant to be in shape or eat good food. I'm like nonsense
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.180]   He just started you have to start training
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:08.540]   you know, you're gonna have to start with walking and then go from walking to jogging and give it six months of
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:13.460]   Regular work and you'll be much better shape for running again
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:20.340]   If as we'd like this come back to again and again if Alexander Sarsgaard can get into Viking shape in six months
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:23.300]   You can get into the ability to run a mile
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.580]   In six months as our touchstone for a lot of things same thing with food
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.860]   You got to start eating a little bit better making more things at home getting more used to it. It just takes some work
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.780]   We're used to that in the world of fitness. We're used to that in the world of health. Well, we should
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:42.660]   Translate that comfort that idea that we're comfortable with to the world of cognitive pursuits as well
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.820]   Yes, if you're slack jawed with the drool looking at tick-tock most of the time
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:53.700]   You're not going to do well when you pick up a book if you're captain email and slack
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:58.820]   When you say now it's time for me to go do deep work and figure out a big new philosophical concept
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.940]   It's not going to go well
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:06.420]   But you know what if you do the cognitive equivalent of Sarsgaard's Viking training you will get better at that
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.660]   We've talked about what that could be, but you need to embrace boredom
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:16.020]   So on a semi regular basis have brief exposures to boredom your weight in line
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.900]   You do nothing once a week do a longer exposure like a walk with nothing in your ears that gets you more comfortable
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:25.580]   With the idea that sometimes you don't get stimuli when you're bored
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:32.560]   Then you can begin doing direct stretch training on your concentration ability do intervals. Here's my watch ten minutes
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   No distraction or I have to reset the watch
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.100]   Once you're comfortable working hard for ten make it fifteen
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.020]   You can slowly start pushing that up do productive meditation sections one problem in my head
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.220]   Work on it while walking when my attention wanders notice and bring it back
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:51.380]   Notice and bring it back the walks can start small the problems you're working on your head can start easy
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:57.460]   Expand and increase as you get more comfortable. You can do these things. You know, what's going to happen over time
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.780]   You're gonna be more comfortable
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.980]   reading books
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:06.740]   Watching a harder movie and not having to look at a tablet thinking about a hard business problem
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:12.500]   Writing something for 90 minutes at a time without having to jump to the cognitive crutch of looking at email looking at slack
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   You will get in better shape
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.500]   and I think
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:20.620]   Everyone should get in that shape just like no one should just be eating junk food and never move
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:27.700]   You should not be in a cognitive situation in which you rarely challenge your mind or have any freedom from constant
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.900]   highly optimized
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.460]   distraction
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:37.260]   Now what about the types of aptitudes that are pointed out in things like the Clifton strength finders test?
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.820]   I think we're talking about something
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:45.580]   Different there you do a strength finders test. You might find I'm really well suited to
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:53.700]   Coordinating teams is maybe more my strength than it is trying to come up with original strategy
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.900]   Well, that's useful for shaping which direction you go in your career
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:05.380]   But it doesn't mean you can't have a floor of cognitive comfort if I can concentrate when I need to I can consume higher quality
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.900]   Leisure everyone could have that floor the strengths might tell you what general direction you might want to go in your career
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.020]   The other thing people talk about is, you know, hey, look, maybe I'm not
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:22.060]   Super brainiac. I'm not one of those MIT theory group professors that can and this is a true story move things with their mind
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:28.760]   Just stare at something and make it move. That's how smart they are. That might be true. But those type of fundamental
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:35.520]   Abilities less sort of raw horsepower. You might be born with that's only relevant in terms of the ceiling you can hit
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.140]   Right and again, we're comfortable with this when it comes to fitness
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:45.880]   You're not going to tell me don't get in better shape and start jogging because you know what you're never going to be on the Olympic
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.940]   Team like your genes aren't going to allow you to actually run a fast enough mile to be on the Olympics
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.580]   I say that's fine. I don't need to compete with Olympic athletes
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.100]   I need to be able to run a mile without throwing up that's different
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.700]   So same thing you don't need to be able to move things with your mind like some MacArthur award-winning
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:07.360]   MIT professor in order to be able to focus on a business problem for an hour and to be able to go on a long
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.220]   Walk without any distraction
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.300]   You can be in good shape without having to be elite
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.460]   So that's what I'm gonna come down on here
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.400]   Adi is yes
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.420]   Maybe we have different
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:22.020]   aptitudes that we should keep in mind when we do our lifestyle such a career planning and try to think what we want our life
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:28.900]   To be like what type of things we want to work on but everyone should have a base level and everyone can accomplish a base
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.580]   Level of cognitive fitness just like you should with your physical health your mind
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:36.100]   needs to have a
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:43.300]   declaration of freedom from the slack jaw distraction and the easy diversion of email and slack the slack jaw
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:49.300]   Distraction of a tick tock or of an Instagram. You should be comfortable being alone with your own thoughts
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:54.620]   You should be comfortable concentrate on something kind of difficult should be caught and comfortable with self-reflection boredom
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:55.740]   Shouldn't scare you
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:58.980]   Everyone should be able to get there just like everyone should be able to go on a light jog
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.400]   Without dry heaving when it's over. So how do you I get the spirit of your question?
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.140]   But I'm gonna push back on some of the specifics
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.700]   Embracing boring really works
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:14.400]   Yeah, like I heard you say that I don't know several years ago before I even knew you and I started doing it
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.260]   It was did you know you noticed a difference huge? Yeah now I do it and I see people they can't do it
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.140]   They don't even know what that means. Yeah. Well for you, it must be really useful
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:29.300]   You might must notice it when you're doing even just casual athletic pursuits, right? Yeah, like what about golf?
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:36.580]   If you're comfortable, just let me just stay with what's going on in this game. Yeah, I'll let my attention wander
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.440]   Really? I'm assuming the players who look at their phone all the time in between holes. I don't even bring my phone
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.340]   I get yeah
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.780]   They get distracted all the time
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:49.180]   Like it's got the number of bad shots you make your bad shot rate has to go up quite a bit, right?
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.180]   If you're constantly got on because I mean
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.980]   Say somebody hits a bad shot
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:58.500]   Then their reaction would be to look at their phone so they get bad news and that's like hitting two bad shots
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.700]   Yeah, or so they get you know, and then they're not there for the next shot and a spiral. Yeah
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:08.060]   Yeah, sometimes like you could have somebody like say you're like in a partner event or whatever and they're on their phone the whole time
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:13.200]   It's like they're not in the game. They're not there. Yeah. Yeah, also it feels bad
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.580]   It's this weird trade-off like the the state of constant distraction. It's
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:20.220]   It's appealing in the moment in the sense of it's a I
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.900]   Don't know numbing
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:27.100]   but it's not the same type of satisfaction of man is beautiful out here and
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:35.540]   Just enjoying it and I'm walking, you know across the course and the Sun is starting to go down and and
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.740]   Your mind is kind of clear and present like that's way more satisfying
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.400]   well, it's like you said like way back in the day how you know, the
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:51.940]   The financials for these people is like 20x like what oil exploration is. Yeah, I mean, it's designed to do that and it's working
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.540]   Yeah. Yeah, they're really good. I've been going deep. I'm right really good at it
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:58.660]   Like as you know, I was writing right before this
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:03.700]   Episode I have to run now to keep writing have a deadline and and I don't like to give details articles before they're out
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.700]   But I'm working on an article right now
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:12.900]   And I have to go kind of deep into tick-tock their algorithm and and its rise the fame. Let me just say this
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.900]   Here's my summary. They're good at it
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.420]   Like they're good at it. Just like
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:20.260]   you know
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:29.220]   What's that chicken everyone likes or whatever the I don't know the brands very well what a flight chick-fil-a like they're really good at cooking things
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:34.780]   We're like man. Yeah, this is really good. I really like eating this right like they're good at it
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.940]   There's a reason why there's always a line there. Yeah, you know, they're good at it McDonald's fries
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.540]   Like they're really good at it. You know, like I'm just going to keep eating these
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:50.180]   Mm-hmm. I could I could eat a bucket of these things that tick-tock is really good at just next thing next thing next thing
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.180]   You know, but it's just a different
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:56.100]   Feel it's like eating the McDonald's flies you eat the bucket like in the moment
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.860]   You're like I kind of am glad I'm doing this then when you're done. You're not happy with the world
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.660]   I think it's the same thing you come off of like all the scrolling like I kind of numb myself. I'm unhappy
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:10.380]   It's just it doesn't it doesn't it's distraction snacking. It doesn't serve what you really need
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.060]   It doesn't serve the real meal that the brain the brain actually desires
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:18.540]   So there you go. I don't care what the StrengthsFinder says stop looking at your phone so much
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:23.940]   Alright, well speaking of stopping and working on deeper things. I got to go right so let's wrap up this episode
