[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:20.380]   That has now made connections to research and studies as a causative agent, not the causative agent, but one of the causative agents of the stimulus for laying down amyloid plaque, which is, in the old days, we thought that was Alzheimer's.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.960]   But now we know that's a sign that you're headed towards Alzheimer's.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.240]   So that's how the body responds to a bug in the mouth.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:35.280]   It becomes inflamed and it lays down the amyloid plaque, which leads to degeneration of all the neuronal pathways that leads to dementia.
