[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Big shout out to the founder of Tortuga, who's a listener of the show and helped us design some
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.560]   custom day packs for our trip to Iceland for everyone that came. We've got logos on them,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.800]   really, really amazing. But their core backpack is also fantastic. It's a big travel bag that
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.400]   still is a carry on. And it's basically my main bag when I'm going anywhere. If I do need a
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.760]   roller board, I have an away roller board and a Manos roller board that's a little bigger.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.800]   And then for kind of gear, especially for parents, kind of a better, in my opinion,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.400]   at least diaper bag is another All The Hacks listener made a company called 50/50 gear,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.680]   and they've got some really cool stuff. And then Kuyana makes a travel case that my wife
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480]   has gifted to a lot of people over the years, you can get custom monogrammed,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.720]   their little leather bags that make a great makeup or bag like that.
