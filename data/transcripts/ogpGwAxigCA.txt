[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Dustin the Dad asked, "The all-in pod has a contrarian streak. Do you find a similar
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.760]   mindset useful when investing in early-stage ventures?" I think it's necessary to have
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.800]   outsized returns in venture be based on making investments that other folks are not making.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   If the market appears to be de-risked, it's likely because there are multiple
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.200]   players or participants that are all chasing the same thing, which means that the market
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.440]   will likely get competed away over time. If you're investing where everyone else is investing,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.160]   typically prices inflate, costs inflate, and your multiples reduce. The best investments
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000]   are the singular ones, the ones that don't look like anything else. Those are very hard
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.080]   investments to make because other people aren't making them, so you don't get social validation
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.160]   that indicates that this is a good investment. A lot of investors look for that social validation
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.240]   because they consider themselves participants in a marketplace and that that marketplace
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.880]   ultimately needs to agree with them for them to get paid.
