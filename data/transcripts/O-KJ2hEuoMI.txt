[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Well, here we are, all again, another round.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.640]   And unlike the first time where we kind of did some more general ideas behind the translation,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.080]   this time we want to go into a little bit more detail, kind of take people behind the
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.080]   scenes.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.080]   They have a lot of questions.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.240]   They're great questions.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.800]   And sometimes people just don't know all that goes behind a translation.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.440]   And by giving them that information, it can be really clarifying and really edifying.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.760]   And so that's kind of the goal of this time.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.220]   I'm just going to ask you questions.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.880]   This time I don't have to work as hard.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.520]   I can ask you guys the questions and you all can help us understand better the nature of
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.920]   translation and what we did in the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.080]   So with that in mind, kind of a first question, regards of fundamental framework kind of issue.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.360]   Sometimes when people come to their translation, they're looking for what speaks to me, what
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.520]   sounds good to me.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.480]   It uses my kind of language.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.960]   I like the way it sounds.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.920]   And while that's not bad and those aren't wrong ideas, the question I would have is,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.200]   is that the most fundamental question we should be asking when we think about the issue of
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200]   translation?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.560]   So Jason, help us to think through the notion of a window.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.480]   What is the purpose of a translation, specifically a Bible translation, a translation of the
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.960]   Scripture, the Word of God?
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680]   And help us to have the right approach here as we begin.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.280]   I think one of the things that, as we approach the project in general, is that the fundamental
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.680]   aspect of what we're looking to accomplish is having a window for the reader to be able
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.880]   to peer into the original language.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.400]   We are, I would say, we are strong in holding to inspiration.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.520]   We look at that every part, every word is inspired and the whole of Scripture is inspired.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.880]   And so with that kind of a fundamental baseline as we approach the text, we're looking to
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.040]   replicate an author's word choice, a particular wordplay that he has decided to do.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   And so our goal was not to simply kind of smooth it out and be stylistic and do different
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.320]   changes and things like that.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   Our goal was to be as close to the original so the reader could look into that window
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.440]   and see this is what the authorial intent accomplished.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.040]   This is how we looked at the text and worked hard to replicate what the original said into
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.200]   English as best we could so the reader could see the word plays, they could see the authorial
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.280]   flow and thought.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.720]   One of the things that comes to mind is 2 Timothy 3.17 and the NASB has this, "so that
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.760]   the man of God may be adequate and equipped for every good work."
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.160]   But there's a wordplay there, "artos" and "exartos" and so you have this idea of being
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.300]   equipped and then we wanted to show that emphasis of that second term use, that perfect participle
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.920]   of being thoroughly equipped and that's kind of when you look at it and it may seem redundant
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   but it's not redundant because as we really hold fast to what the author chose, inspired
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.160]   by the spirit, looking at and choosing that wordplay, we wanted to replicate that as best
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.800]   we could for the reader so they could follow along because the goal I think in all of it
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.540]   is to be that window to show what the author has written versus kind of the stylistic and
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.680]   smoothing it out.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.640]   - Yeah, so in other words, a translation is not necessarily what I'd like it to be but
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   what the scripture says and that's kind of the standard and in this case, we're trying
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   to make sure that when people read their Bible, in a sense, it's almost as if they're reading
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.520]   the Greek and Hebrew, what we would see when we read Greek and Hebrew and so if something's
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.040]   repeated there, we should repeat it.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.920]   If there's a wordplay there, we should read it and have it that way because we're trying
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.320]   to replicate, we're trying to be that window into the original.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   That's really helpful.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.260]   - Yeah, and it goes into even levels of grammar so we talked about either repetition or as
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.960]   Jason said, trying to see the emphatic, the participle, the perfect but if you see a series
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.280]   of participles, sometimes in the NAS, it was translated as a verb or as an imperative.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.000]   We tried to demonstrate, no, there's actual parallelism that the author was trying to
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.200]   convey and we're going to capture that as much as possible for this translation.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.000]   - Yeah, no, this is helpful.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   We are trying to replicate what is going on in the original text and so we're not really
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.680]   making decisions based upon what we would like.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.000]   We're making decisions based upon the standard which is what the original said and matching
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   that.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.200]   That's kind of determining us.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.080]   - Yeah, because when you think of like Mark, right, and you look at Mark and we translated
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.440]   all the chi's in Mark because Mark specifically chose those chi's and so it might seem redundant
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.080]   at first, the ands, the ands, the ands in that but Mark specifically chose those things
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.480]   for a reason and so leaving it there for the reader to be able to follow and then also
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   ask the question, why did Mark choose to structure his gospel that way?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.160]   - Yeah, this is helpful.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.840]   Our choices are really determined by the Bible's choices in that way.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.680]   - Let me, can I add one more example to this?
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   I think it's helpful.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   - Please.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   - Especially in John.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   So John, in his gospel, tries to emphasize this eternality of eternal life and protection
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.680]   that we get from God and so I remember we had a long discussion about how to best capture
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   this.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   - I remember that.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   - So one example is from John chapter eight.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   It's a famous verse.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.720]   I will give them eternal life and they will never perish but we added ever because in
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.120]   the original Greek, there is more emphasis just never perish and there's different ways
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.040]   to say that and so in order to show this to the reader, we did this in every single instance
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   of that phrase.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.760]   - Yeah, there's a very emphatic negation or extension and there's several levels of it
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.360]   and this is the most intense and yeah, I remember we really wrestled with how to convey that
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.160]   and each of those distinctions properly and that's a great example.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.400]   That's really helpful and all of this I think illustrates that I think earlier in our conversation,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.640]   Pastor John, Dr. MacArthur said, "Do you guys have a manual for these kinds of things?"
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.520]   and we said, "No, there's no written guidebook."
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.520]   I mean, sometimes I think we wish there was one that kind of said, "Step one, do this.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   Step two, do that," but that doesn't mean that there weren't carefully designed reasons
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.200]   and carefully designed principles that drove every single decision.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.520]   It wasn't done on a whim and so I think it's good to take people behind the scenes and
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.320]   show these are the decisions, these are the principles involved and they guided and they
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.520]   actually set the boundary lines and determine the decisions that we made and so I just like
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.080]   to walk through some of these big principles and it even helps people to know how we thought
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.280]   through this and it makes them better able to use a translation because they would know,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   "Oh, if the translators did this here, well, that's probably because of this so I need
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.160]   to be looking for something like that as I study the Bible," and so this kind of gives
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.500]   them that insider information in a good way.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.960]   So with that in mind, let's go through some rules.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.020]   Here's the first one, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," Paul, speak to us on the nature
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.320]   of that and the implications of that.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.960]   So the one thing that I have tried to emphasize to folks as they've asked about the translation
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:58.320]   along the way is that we're building upon the preexisting NASB translation and oftentimes
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.560]   in our discussions, we would say that, "If it's not broken, then don't fix it.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.880]   We're not trying to reinvent the wheel here."
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.120]   The implication is if you're not familiar with the NASB as a translation, this is not
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.800]   going to read as radically different.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.240]   I mean, it doesn't but that's the point.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.720]   If you're very, very familiar with the NASB, you'll see the changes we've made and we're
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.800]   building on that foundation.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:29.080]   But in many senses, the aim of the project was to preserve and improve upon an already
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.560]   existing translation.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.360]   I think sometimes people wonder when new translations come out, is this undermining people's confidence
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.160]   in translation?
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.360]   And I would say that this project in a lot of ways is the opposite of that.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.980]   What it's trying to do is confirm for generations to come, they did it right.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.980]   They did it right.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.280]   They did it right over and over and over again.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.760]   You can trust this.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.800]   It stands the highest scrutiny.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.360]   It stands multiple rounds of scrutiny.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   They did it right.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.500]   And I think that's really important for us to emphasize to people, especially as translations
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.840]   are coming out and people are thinking, "Well, can anybody figure out what the Word of God
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   says?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.840]   What was written?"
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.720]   And the answer is yes.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.360]   They got it right and that's a legacy that we want to leave with people.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.880]   When you read a psalm or you read any passage and it reads very much like you've read it
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.640]   and you read it and you compare it to NASB and you say, "You guys didn't change anything
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.920]   here."
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.000]   And that's because it was right.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.080]   It was done right.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.520]   And we affirm NASB in that regard.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.420]   I mean, I'm thinking of Psalm 23.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.640]   It's going to read like it's been read, but then you get to verse six and there's going
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:43.080]   to be one word that is different because we could make that word more precise and the
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.440]   word is "follow" versus "pursue."
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.360]   God's loving kindness and goodness, usually it says, "We'll follow you all the days of
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   your life."
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.840]   But we adjusted it to "pursue all the days of your life" because the word is "pursue"
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.600]   and it's the same word that is used when enemies pursue righteous people, like when the Egyptians
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.960]   were pursuing the Israelites in order to kill them.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.040]   Well, that's the word that is used in Psalm 23 and you're thinking, "Well, that's a bad
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   word."
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:16.240]   Well, no, the point of it is that God's pursuit with His goodness and loving kindness is intense,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.440]   but it's the good version of it.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.920]   But you read the entire Psalm, Psalm 23, it's going to read very much the same until you
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.620]   get to that one word and that'll be the only difference.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.640]   But again, that affirms that NASB did it well.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.600]   - But I would also add that if there is no change that's evident, it doesn't mean we
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   skipped it.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   - That's right.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.200]   - We haven't thought about it and we've ultimately decided, "No, this is the best way to say
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   this."
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   - That's right.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   We went through everything.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   - Exactly.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.280]   - Verse by verse, word by word, Old Testament to New Testament.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.400]   And often it came out to be, "This is good.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   This is good.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.240]   There's no need to change it.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's the way it should be and it's an affirmation that you can really trust your translation.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It's well done."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.040]   - And the affirmation of the man who did the work.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   - That's right.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   - Years ago.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.920]   - I grew up in the NASB since I was 10 years old.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.080]   And so all my memorization, everything was done in the NASB.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.280]   And having gone through this project, it was so reaffirming that this is a great translation
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   of the English.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.840]   And I think for people who have loved the NASB translation, have used it, have memorized
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.960]   it, you should be reaffirmed in that commitment and affection.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.440]   And this is going to take it to a different level in nuancing certain things like Joe
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   just exemplified.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.440]   - Yeah.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   And there were several times that we talked about changing something and we looked at
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   trying to do it and then we would circle back and go, "No, actually, this is the best way
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.000]   that it could be rendered."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.440]   - And even when we did make a change, I mean, one of the things people don't think about
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.640]   is when you have to swap a word, what word do you put there?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.920]   And we had to go through the vocabulary of NASB because you can't just insert a word
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.640]   that stands out from the normal diction of the New American Standard.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   You have to have something that blends in, that matches.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.680]   And ultimately, I guess you could say this way for people, we just wanted to make the
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.960]   New American Standard more New American Standard in a lot of ways.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.120]   And we're not trying to deviate from that, we're trying to actually build upon what they
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.160]   always wanted it to be and we were given an opportunity to help make it further that way.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.720]   Well, another kind of rule that we had along the lines that we've been just talking about
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.160]   is we'd only make a modification if there was an issue, for example, of accuracy, of
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   accuracy.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.680]   And what do we mean by accuracy?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.480]   One of the things might be bringing out a nuance of grammar.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.240]   I know, Dr. Varner, you and I were talking earlier about something in Matthew 13.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.400]   And why don't you share that with us?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.440]   - Yeah, it's a very small thing, but it is significant.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.560]   It's in the parable of the soils and it says that others of the seed, as they were sown,
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   fell on the rocky ground, others fell among thorns.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:07.120]   But then the good seed fell on the good ground and instead of saying and yielded a crop,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.360]   we put and were yielding a crop.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.120]   Well, why did we switch from simple past tense to this were yielding?
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   In the Greek, it's the aorist tense and the imperfect tense.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.840]   And I think we did make a right decision by saying and were yielding a crop because there
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.880]   you see the process.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:41.120]   Grow it down, it roots, and it grows, and then it's yielding a crop.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.920]   That's the process.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.200]   Obviously, that yielding a crop would be over months.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.640]   And the imperfect tense there has that what is called the imperfective aspect, the continuing,
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   the process.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.240]   Now, it's a very small thing.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   But other translations just say and yielded a crop.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   And they don't recognize, many of these translations, that there's a shift in the
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   tense.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.600]   Well, why did the author shift the tense?
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.280]   He wanted to make a point.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:23.480]   I want you to notice this, boy, the whole process of the crop developing there.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.200]   Small thing, but I think it's more accurately reflecting the Greek.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.720]   I think that just illustrates that the choices of the scriptures, going back to inspiration,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   they're deliberate.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.320]   And when we reflect those choices, it's not because we arbitrarily chose to do so.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.680]   It's because the Bible told us to do so.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.160]   And if Matthew changed his tense there, we ought to change the tense.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   That's right.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   That's right.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.080]   So there's issues of accuracy relative to grammar.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.840]   Joe, did you have something on the Old Testament?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.240]   Well, there's a accuracy with respect to meanings of words, again, with the new ones.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:07.080]   You can think about Jonah, where Jonah is fleeing from God in the beginning of Jonah
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   chapter 1.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.200]   And he goes into the ship, and God sends a storm on the sea.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.220]   And it describes the ship as typically the texts would say that the ship was about to
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.180]   break apart in the storm.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.380]   But the Hebrew says that the ship was thinking to break apart.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.840]   And you look at that nuance, and you're thinking the ship was thinking.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.520]   What was the ship thinking, right?
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.120]   But that nuance is deliberately put into the text because it's putting in line what the
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.200]   ship was doing with all of the other inanimate objects, right?
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   God sends wind, inanimate object, and it submits to God.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.300]   God sends a worm, and it submits to God.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.400]   God sends a fish to swallow Jonah.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.720]   It submits to God.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.120]   And so all of these inanimate objects are submitting to God.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.480]   And now the ship is also thinking in a way that aligns with all of these other elements
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.880]   that are submitting to God, which is in contrast to what Jonah is doing, right?
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.260]   And so it brings out this nuance, this detail brings out a theological point that even the
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.520]   inanimate objects are submitting to God.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.480]   And yet Jonah, who is created in the image of God and who is a prophet of God, is refusing
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   to submit to God.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.520]   It comes out just from the fact that the word is "think."
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   And just like the imperfect was yielding, it has theological implications on the believer's
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   life.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   Absolutely.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.160]   Process of growing and bearing fruit.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.640]   All of these are theologically significant because the Scripture is theologically significant.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.060]   Thinking through accuracy, it's not just word choice or grammar.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.500]   It can even be because we're wanting to be a window into what was originally written.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.760]   Well, that gets into textual criticism, upholding what was originally written, making sure we
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.200]   safeguard that and affirm that carefully.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.740]   So on the New Testament side, Dr. Varner, help us to think through what was the process
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.060]   of that like and give us some examples.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.060]   Yes.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.880]   Well, in case people don't realize it, we're working from Greek text in the New Testament
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.840]   and Hebrew and Aramaic text in the Old Testament.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.140]   We didn't just look at the NASB's English and said, "How can we improve it?"
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   That's right.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.100]   We're looking underneath the NASB at these Greek texts.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.020]   Now, what Greek text do you translate?
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:29.460]   Erasmus, great scholar, and did us a great service by bringing together the first printed
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.280]   Greek New Testament, worked from only six manuscripts.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.760]   That's all he had.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.360]   And all of them were later than the 12th century AD.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.660]   And he produced a great New Testament that became the basis for Tyndale and the Geneva
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.380]   Bible and the authorized version, the King Jimmy's version.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.380]   Wonderful.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:59.660]   But in the succeeding centuries, other manuscripts much, much earlier than the 12th century were
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.740]   discovered, some of them huge, some of them on papyri.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.460]   And they had earlier readings that may have been changed through the years.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.400]   And it's not Erasmus' fault.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.320]   He just worked with what he had.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:20.500]   Now we work with what we have, and text critics are saying maybe there's a few changes because
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.620]   the earliest manuscripts support a different reading.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.580]   Now it's not radical, but it is important.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.940]   One of my favorites is Jude 5.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:38.260]   In Jude 5, we read, I want to remind you, though you know all things, the King James
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:44.500]   and many translations have that the Lord, having once saved a people out of Egypt, subsequently
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.540]   destroyed those who did not believe.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:55.780]   Our translation has Jesus having once saved a people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.720]   destroyed those who did not believe.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:04.240]   And that might come shocking to the reader, Jesus saved the Israelites out of Egypt?
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.800]   But the earliest and best manuscripts have Jesus, not Lord.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.280]   And maybe later scribes say, "Wow, that's a little bit shocking to see Jesus in the
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.920]   Old Testament."
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.160]   But it's not unbiblical.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.280]   First Corinthians 10 says, "They drank of the rock that followed them, and that rock
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   was Christ."
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.240]   So, and we believe in Jesus' pre-existence.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.980]   So the earliest and best manuscripts have Jesus there.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.480]   But we don't just do that on our own.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.960]   We looked at other editions of the Greek New Testament, and the Nestle-Alan 28th edition
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.480]   has Jesus.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.100]   The SBL Greek New Testament has Jesus.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.840]   The Tyndale House Greek New Testament, the last two of those editions done by evangelicals,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840]   has Jesus.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.960]   So we didn't just go out on our own and say, "Well, early manuscripts have it, but
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.120]   we don't care what anybody else says."
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.400]   The published Greek New Testaments today all have Jesus.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.560]   And I'm surprised that more translations haven't really gone to that.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:19.720]   It's theologically sound, and it's supported by the earliest and best manuscripts.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:26.180]   Now, but also, we don't want to make changes too radically.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:34.200]   We realize that there's tradition, and we realize that there's support for some readings
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.400]   that may be questionable that is earlier.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.760]   I think of Acts 8 37.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.840]   This is the incident of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch, and verse 36 says, "He's ready
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   to get baptized."
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.240]   The eunuch says, "Look, water.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.120]   What prevents me from being baptized?"
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.200]   And the next verse says, "And Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   may.'"
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.720]   And he answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.920]   And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they went down, and they were baptized.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:14.160]   The problem is the earliest manuscripts don't have verse 37, where Philip says, "If you
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.600]   believe with all your heart, you may."
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.400]   Now, there's nothing wrong with that text.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:27.200]   That is speaking the truth, but maybe some later scribes said, "This jumped from what
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.240]   prevents me from being baptized," and he ordered the chariot to stop, and they went down to
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.480]   the water, and he baptized them.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   Well, we require a confession of faith, don't we?
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.480]   Yes.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.760]   Well, he must have required a confession of faith, so they put that in there.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.440]   And of course, the question comes up, if it was original, why would anybody drop that
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   out?
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.960]   Why would anybody drop that out?
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.920]   Because it's theologically sound.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.280]   But if it wasn't in there, you can see how some later scribes say, "Let's make sure that
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.440]   people understand that the Ethiopian believed."
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   But notice the transition without the verse.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.680]   "Look, water, what prevents me from being baptized?"
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.960]   And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they went down in the water, and Philip baptized
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   him.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:20.160]   So now, with all due understanding of the earliest manuscripts not having it, there's
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:27.840]   a tradition here, and we don't want to just run roughshod over the tradition, and so we
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.240]   have included that verse, but in brackets.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:38.120]   And there's nothing theologically wrong in the content of the verse, but we put it in
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.960]   brackets, and future editions will have a note, "The earliest manuscripts do not have
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   this verse."
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.840]   But that takes some work.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.560]   We don't want to do things on our own, but we have other texts that support, like the
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:01.760]   Jude 5, and other texts do not have Acts 8:37, and some texts have it with brackets around
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   it.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.480]   And that's what we've chose to do.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:12.080]   Not run roughshod over tradition, but respect it, but also make decisions not just on tradition,
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   but on the earliest and the best manuscripts.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.000]   - That's really helpful, and by putting things in brackets and in footnotes, just like the
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.240]   New American Standard did, I mean, we're not reinventing the wheel there, we're just adopting
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.040]   their philosophy, and it's a good one, because our job is to give people the resources to
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.960]   understand what's going on, to make informed decisions, and this provides them the opportunity
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.840]   to do so, and that's kind of been our goal.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.540]   This is good for accuracy.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:46.080]   Another aspect of accuracy on textual criticism is not just the New Testament side, but on
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   the Old Testament side.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080]   Joe, help us out here.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.680]   - Yeah, the rigor that goes into looking at the textual critical matters in the Old Testament
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.660]   is just as rigorous as in the New Testament, and I think in that regard, I would just affirm
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.940]   what we said earlier, that NASB did a great job, and we consulted various questions that
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:10.000]   arose, but we worked with the BHS, so the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, and they have
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.160]   excellent notes for us in a textual critical apparatus.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.280]   There's also Masoretic notes on the sides which sometimes relate to textual critical
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   matters.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.200]   We consulted those, then there's also the Biblia Hebraica Quinta that's coming out.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.620]   It's partially out, not all of it, but those are also available for consideration, and
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.060]   of course, there's the versions, the translations.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.660]   There's the Septuagint, there are the Targums, which are in Aramaic.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.700]   There's the Syriac Peshitta, in Syriac, of course, the Latin, so all of those were, when
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.220]   questions arose, we could consult those and make decisions, and for the most part, we
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.180]   affirmed what NASB did.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:58.060]   But there were some parts that we made adjustments to, but with footnotes and recognition that
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.060]   there was a change made.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.900]   Now, just as an example of what we affirmed, in Ruth chapter 4, verse 5, there's a textual
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:12.140]   critical matter when Boaz is talking to Polonium Moni, and the elders.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:18.380]   He says to him that, you know, the moment that you acquire the field from Naomi, you
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.100]   also acquire Ruth.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.300]   And there's a question, does he say, "You acquire Ruth," or, "I acquire Ruth?"
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.940]   The text could go either way.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:32.820]   I mean, so after considering the Hebrew, the internal evidence, the logic of the text,
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.140]   consulting the various translations, the Aramaic, the Greek, we decided that the NASB did it
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.140]   right.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:46.300]   That you will acquire Ruth with the property, and so we left that as is, with the footnote
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.060]   explaining that there is a question there.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:55.220]   But a smaller textual critical question appears in Deuteronomy chapter 11, verses 13, 14,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:01.640]   and 15, and there the context is that Moses is speaking to the people, and he's saying
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.020]   to them that he's reciting God's commandments to them, and he's saying that, "If you obey
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.020]   me, you will be blessed."
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   Right?
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:13.100]   He's saying, "If you obey the commandments that I'm giving you," and this is Moses speaking,
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:19.420]   then verse 14 continues to say that, "Then he will send you rain."
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:25.460]   Now, "he" is a reference to God, but the Hebrew says, "I will send you rain."
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.980]   And so there is a rough transition in the Hebrew where Moses says, "If you obey the
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.940]   commandments that I am giving you, then I will give you rain."
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.020]   It sounds as if Moses is the one who's sending the rain.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:43.220]   Well, after considering the external evidence and the internal evidence, we came to the
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.660]   conclusion that it has to be "I."
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.020]   But that's what the Hebrew text says, and there's no evidence, strong evidence to suggest
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.620]   that it should be otherwise.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.060]   And so then we looked at the rest of the Old Testament, and we searched and saw, does the
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.560]   Old Testament do this anywhere else, where there's this sharp, if you will, transition
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.340]   from one speaker to another speaker, and it's actually, there's plenty of examples.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.820]   Zechariah 12, verses 8, 9, and 10, Zechariah is speaking, and then there's an immediate
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.380]   switch to Yahweh speaking.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:20.020]   And so because of that, we adjusted the NASB, and we put "I" in the text, and we put "he"
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.980]   in the footnote, and then we have a small comment explaining that there is a question
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   there.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.620]   - And even in that case, I think we put "I, Yahweh," so that people would know it's not
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:36.660]   Moses, it's Yahweh Himself giving these exhortations, these conclusions, just for the sake of clarity.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.660]   And that's in italics.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.700]   - And it's in italics, so that it's clear that this is a clarification.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.660]   - Yes, it's us helping the reader just to make sure that they don't confuse it.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.980]   But that's the drama of the text.
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.980]   That's the drama of the text.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.580]   - Another note on the italics, I was thinking a little bit earlier that some of the criticism
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.820]   against the NASB has been there's too many words in italics.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.380]   And people have sent us suggestions, "Can you please minimize that in your translation?"
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.860]   And we took that for consideration, and we did, I think, our best to minimize the italics.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.900]   But if it's still in there, it's really the smoothest way to read the English.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:16.660]   - Yeah, and that's what readers have said when they've turned drafts back to us.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.780]   Having read it, they said, "This is really smooth.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.260]   It reads nicely.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.860]   I don't see anything abrasive."
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:27.820]   And I think that's just the right balance of having enough italics to help make grammatical
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.260]   sense, but not having too much that it's unnecessary.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.220]   And sometimes readers will come back and say, "I think we could drop that one, too."
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.820]   And we're saying, "Oh, that's great.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.820]   We'll do it."
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.340]   Because we're for that, absolutely.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:45.020]   Another aspect of accuracy is allusions, recognizing allusions.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.660]   The NASB had things in small caps when they alluded back to the Old Testament.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:55.140]   That's a great marker, and we tried to look at different resources to help us do that.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.900]   Jason, do you have any examples of that?
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   - Yeah, one of those allusions in the small caps for the Old Testament is in 2 Thessalonians
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.820]   2, verse 8.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.580]   And that reads that, "And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   will slay with the breath of his mouth."
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:21.140]   And that's really pointing back to Isaiah 11, 4, and making that connection of the righteous
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.600]   Messiah, the righteous branch who will rule in Isaiah 11.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:33.420]   And so there's this pointing back to the Old Testament that Paul does in the context of
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:40.420]   Jesus coming and slaying the lawless one with his breath that's linking it back to Isaiah
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.500]   chapter 11.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.420]   There's a couple that, you know, as we work through it, we wanted to make sure that as
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.640]   best we could, we could help the reader kind of be able to trace back when the author was
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.020]   alluding to an Old Testament text so they could go back and deepen their study.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:01.540]   One was that really, I think, those that read Philippians that maybe even caught them off
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:07.220]   guard is Paul actually alludes to Job 13.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:12.180]   In Philippians 1, 19, he says this, "For I know that this will turn out for my salvation."
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:18.360]   And so you go back to Job 13, and then that context, Job 13, 16.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.260]   But even in 15, "Though He slay me, I will trust in Him, hope in Him.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.660]   And then this will turn out for my deliverance."
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.340]   And Paul actually draws off of that language.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.260]   And there's a depth there that I think if you didn't see that, you'd miss it.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.340]   Same thing with chapter 2, right?
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:42.100]   There's the whole "Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess" in chapter 2, verses
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   10 and 11.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.220]   And I think that the NAS had those in capitals, but one of the things that I think that, you
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.140]   know, for us, especially with this translation, is we put in small caps "LORD."
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.860]   And I think that, because as I was paying attention to people talking, you're like,
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.660]   "Well, how are they going to translate 'LORD' in the New Testament?
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.260]   Are they going to superimpose 'Yahweh'?"
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.940]   Because it's kurios, and all those questions.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:12.060]   And I think what we tried to do is, if we could footnote it.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:18.820]   But then if there was a quotation like Isaiah 45, where God says, "I am Yahweh, I am the
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.080]   only one.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.940]   Every knee will bow and every tongue confess."
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.700]   And Paul draws that, and he actually applies that to Jesus.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:35.000]   And so we, in our small caps in "LORD" there, are pointing the reader back to Isaiah 45
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.500]   and showing this clear deity of Christ, where Paul is saying, "All will bow the knee and
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.860]   Jesus will be worshipped because He is God."
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.860]   And I think those things, those little things, really deepen the study for the reader.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.480]   - Yeah, no, that's very helpful.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   That's very helpful.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:32:00.120]   I think in our notes, we made a footnote for every one of those small caps kind of passage
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.640]   that directs the reader back to the Old Testament to know, "Yeah, this is where that quote is
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   coming from.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.100]   This is where that information is coming from."
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.100]   That's very helpful.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.380]   So we've been talking about different principles.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.120]   One of them we said was, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.240]   Another one we emphasized was accuracy.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.760]   And another big one is consistency.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.640]   Mark help us to think through the issue of consistency.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   I have a couple examples that I think will help.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.500]   So in the Gospel of John, there's a word, "parasia" in the Greek that is translated
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.840]   multiple ways in the English.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:38.040]   Sometimes open, sometimes frank, sometimes not in secret, sometimes public, but it's
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.440]   the same word in the Greek.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:45.320]   And so we work quite a bit actually to try to come up with one word that would capture
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   all the different passages with that Greek word.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.220]   And one example is John 7, verse 13.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.200]   This is in the context of Jesus going to Jerusalem.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.160]   His brothers are trying to send him there.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.720]   And he said, "Look, if you are truly the Messiah, why are you hiding?"
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   And so in the middle of that, Jesus does end up there.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.400]   And it says that the people were so afraid of the Jewish leadership because of what the
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   consequences could be for professing Jesus to be the Christ.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.600]   It says in verse 13, "No one was speaking openly about him for the fear of the Jews."
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.220]   And so you have this open and then multiple passages later in John 16, the disciples after
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.160]   trying to understand Jesus' prophecies about the future, finally say, "Okay, now you're
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.320]   now speaking openly to us," whereas in a few other places in Nazby has different synonyms.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.920]   And so when you look at the legacy standard, you'll see this word appear repeatedly.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's because it is the same exact word.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.720]   And I think our struggle was that finding the right English word that would capture
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.040]   the meaning and not sound awkward in the English.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:53.840]   And I think of another example in Philippians, Philippians chapter 2, now many of us have
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.040]   memorized that verse who just, you know, love the Bible.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.080]   But it's because it's so Christ-oriented, that whole passage, the first 11 verses of
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   chapter 2.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:09.120]   And something, another nuance different than what Jason was highlighting is that there's
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.800]   a call to humility and unity and single-mindedness.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.080]   And in verse 2, it says, "Think the same way, maintain the same love, think on the
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   same purpose."
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.720]   And then in verse 5, "Have this way of thinking."
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.840]   Well, the Nazby said, "Have this mindset," but it's the same word in the Greek.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.800]   And so if you're following along this whole paragraph, you see, "Think, think, think,"
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   going back to Christ.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.020]   So the whole point is, "Think like Christ thinks."
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.540]   And so you're not thrown off by a synonym in English.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.800]   You keep, see the argument develop that ultimately we have the mind of Christ from 1 Corinthians
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.200]   chapter 2, and now this is what it looks like in real life as you spend time with people
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.040]   and the humility that you're to exemplify.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.320]   - Mark, I think you're exemplifying something else that we tried to do as well.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.440]   Mindset and way of thinking, it sort of means the same thing, okay?
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.640]   It's not wicked, that other translation.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:18.700]   It means the same thing, but we're trying to see the similarities and use that word
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.500]   and that word group consistently through the passage.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:28.920]   So using thinking, there's a reason by it.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:34.240]   You know, there's in the modern view of translation, you want to be more readable, more readable,
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   more readable.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.700]   Well, we're not against that at all.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:45.400]   But if we could put the arrow back a little bit towards accuracy and if it's still readable,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.960]   and that is have this way of thinking, I think we're on the right track.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:56.160]   And so we're just trying to be consistent with the use of the word within the passage.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.680]   - I think it serves two purposes.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.520]   One is what we're alluding to here.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.400]   You see a consistency of thought within the immediate context, so you can follow the argument
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.340]   more closely, I think.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.760]   But secondarily, you start to see a consistency of thought across a corpus.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.160]   So now you get to see this one idea encapsulated by a single word throughout the Johannine
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.120]   corpus or throughout the Pauline corpus.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:31.000]   And that, again, just affirms the consistency of the Scriptures, the unity of the Scriptures,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.960]   and will be helpful not just as people study individual texts, but as people read through
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   the Scriptures, I hope.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   - Right.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.880]   So, you know, I think katsumi work out.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.940]   And when we use that word in a specific nuance, we have to recognize that words have multiple
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.940]   nuances.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.240]   And sometimes there's a reason that there's a distinction between the two, and you've
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.280]   got to maintain that.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.400]   So our consistency wasn't just, hey, there's a word, plug in over there, the same word,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   no matter what.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.320]   It was, we have to understand that words have different nuances, different categories within
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.560]   themselves, and we want to match each thing according to those categories.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.840]   But as we did that, the word worked out.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.480]   And I remember one of the reviewers reading it and saying, "Hey, is that the same word
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.760]   in Philippians 2?
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   I see it in Romans.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760]   Is that the same thing going on?"
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.980]   He goes, "I just knew that because I saw the word."
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.640]   You mean you can actually do that.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   You can actually see a word and just make the correlation across it.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.660]   So that's the design of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.420]   And that helps people to even think about a word study better, and a pastor to access
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:42.060]   and explain word studies better from the pulpit because everything is nicely correlated in
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.060]   these ways.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.340]   That is very, very helpful.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.300]   Yeah, and I think those who read the Greek regularly, those who studied it, they read
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.660]   it, it comes to mind.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.140]   The more you read the New Testament, the more you remember, oh, this phrase or this word
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.140]   appeared elsewhere.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:59.020]   Well, now the people reading the Legacy Standard can do something similar.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.460]   And I think we've gone as far as we possibly could to accomplish this goal.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.980]   Yeah, and that's, again, goes back to the whole notion of window.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   Yeah, window and accuracy of Dr. Vonnepot.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.980]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   That's right.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.500]   Yeah, and the beauty of this is that it happens across the board.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:18.900]   Paul was saying it happens within the passage, then within the corpus, within the book and,
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.180]   you know, within, between books, the Old Testament and the New Testament, and Jason referred
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.300]   to some references from the New Testament to the Old Testament.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.840]   And just some of the smaller examples that we've discussed happen in a similar way in
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   the Old Testament as well.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:40.380]   You can think to Daniel chapter 2 and 3, where you have Nebuchadnezzar having a dream about
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   a statue.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.420]   In the Nazareth, he says that he had a dream about a statue.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:50.300]   And then in chapter 3, it says that he built the image of that statue, evidently that he
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   had.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:57.940]   Well, the word for statue and for image is actually the same word in chapter 2 and chapter
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.940]   3.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.340]   So we translated it as image, all of them.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.540]   And in that case, it becomes immediately clear that what he's building is exactly what he
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.060]   saw in his dream.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.660]   Now that's not the end of the story because he builds that image and then he has the entire
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:22.460]   nation come and worship that image as a command that he gives to the nation, to the people.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:28.220]   Well, there are three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who refused to bow to that image.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:34.380]   And the text says that when they refused, the translation in chapter 3 verse 19 says
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.420]   that the expression of his face changed.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:42.620]   But the expression of his face is the exact same word for image.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.220]   The image of his face changed.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.600]   So what the text is doing is it's saying that he had a dream of an image.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.460]   He built that image.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.680]   He himself is that image.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.420]   And so when he has the nation come and bow down to that image, he's actually requiring
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.580]   worship of himself.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:08.660]   That's a big deal because the image is now representing him.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.300]   But when we think about the Bible on a bigger scale, we remember another passage where somebody
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.500]   creates somebody in their image or in his image, I should say, right?
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.600]   In Genesis chapter 1, God is creating man in his image.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.900]   And when we make that connection across the books, we see that what Nebuchadnezzar is
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.000]   doing is he's really trying to fill the place of God, creating somebody in his own image,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.240]   and then requiring worship from those people of himself, of his image.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.260]   And you make that connection because we now translate the words in a consistent manner.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.380]   - And you can cross the Testament.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.380]   - That's right.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.180]   - So as he's speaking, I'm thinking of Romans 1, they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.340]   God for an image in likeness of corruptible man.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.820]   And so now you have Paul writing against, you know, unsaved humanity saying now they
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.780]   are bowing down to creation.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.220]   And it's all, again, another attempt at creating some form of an image and to worship that
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.660]   image, whether it's you make an image of yourself and calling people to worship yourself or
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.860]   you're worshiping other images.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.900]   But again, all this speaks to man rebelling against God.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.060]   And then the wrath of God is revealed because of that exact practice that Nebuchadnezzar
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.060]   essentially illustrates for us.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   - That's right.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   - What's in the heart of man.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.060]   - Yeah, and then...
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.060]   Go ahead.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.900]   - Yeah, I was thinking, and if a layman says, "Well, I don't understand Hebrew and Greek,
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.100]   you know what you're talking about," that's okay.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.780]   We do, and that's why we're trying to translate this consistently so you can see what the
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.980]   Hebrew and Greek says.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.620]   It says image, image, image.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.340]   You don't have to know Hebrew and Greek.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.340]   - That's right.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.780]   - But then take it a step further.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.860]   He is the image of the invisible God.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.860]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   - And it's Christ.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   - That's right.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.420]   - And so now there is a command that we should be worshiping to speak, you know, lexically
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.820]   here, an image.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.820]   But it's Jesus Christ.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.620]   So he's the only one worthy of worshiping.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:59.460]   So in that New Testament, whether it's John 1 or Colossians 2 or Colossians 1 as well,
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.460]   and then you have Hebrews 1, you know, kind of repeating that same idea that Jesus Christ
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.560]   represents God perfectly, and we are to worship him now.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.180]   - And it connects, yeah, like you said, the whole Testament.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   - And the word is the image.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   - Testament together.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.540]   - And another example I thought, because I'm writing this devotional based on the Legacy
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:22.020]   Standard Bible and I was sharing with Joe, that we had made this decision earlier throughout
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.820]   these different scenes of women at the well.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:30.360]   You have Moses interacting, you have Abraham's servant interacting, you have Jacob interacting,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.660]   and there's a certain verb, and there are different ways to translate it.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.040]   You could legitimately translate it in multiple ways, but we wanted to standardize the translation
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:45.200]   to instead of watering or giving a drink of water or whatever, just simply give a drink,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.940]   give a drink, just to give a drink of water, cause the animals to drink, something of that
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   nature.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:56.140]   And it was consistent and consistent, and I wanted to draw out the connection between
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.460]   all these women at the well scenes and how they're interconnected and why that mattered,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.840]   and ultimately tie it to the woman at the well scene, John 4.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   And it's fascinating.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.860]   When I got to John 4, I just sat there and I thought, "Wow, did we do that on purpose?
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.200]   Or what happened?"
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.900]   And Jesus says to the woman, "What?
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.180]   Give me a drink."
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.040]   And all of a sudden you just see the repetition, and you realize this is not by accident.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   This is not by accident.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:25.620]   This is by God's design, both in the event and in His Word, to link it all together and
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.860]   to show the climax of what He's been doing through the Old Testament into the New Testament.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.500]   And these are just kinds of the insights that you can have when you have consistency.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.420]   It is really marvelous, marvelous to see.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.100]   - But it also speaks into the mind of the author.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.780]   God used John to write that gospel as He knew His Old Testament.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.300]   And so He's now trying to make these connections, and it gives us, I think, a lesson, especially
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:53.340]   those who are teachers of the Bible, that use Scripture to interpret Scripture, because
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.340]   that's what they were doing.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.820]   They were leaning on previous revelation as they were writing and preaching and so on.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.540]   We see so many quotes, as Jason pointed out a few minutes ago, whether it's in Acts or
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:08.620]   in other Pauline literature, that the Old Testament was being used by first Christians
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.620]   to that effect.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:15.500]   - And one thing we try to do to ensure this, and Jason and Paul can attest to this particularly,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.300]   is double-check everything.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.620]   Yeah, Paul, I always inflict you with these kinds of things.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.420]   Thank you for bearing up with this.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.660]   - And the truth of the matter is, with all of the technology we have, there are no shortcuts.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.660]   - Correct.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:35.180]   - So it was just sitting there, having worked through the translation and come up with,
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:40.740]   I guess, a first draft, and now we have to proofread it and double-check everything.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.540]   And it would be not just making sure that the English makes sense and is readable, but
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:51.660]   have we attained the standard that we've set in terms of consistency?
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:58.500]   And you were commenting one time we met that how you've just memorized all of the numbers
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:04.140]   that are attached to these words, because you're just in them all the time to make sure
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:09.860]   that this word here, that is the same in the original, we've maintained that consistency
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.420]   as we've gone across.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:18.300]   And it does take a long time, but it's necessary and hopefully worth the effort.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:23.020]   - Well, what all of this demonstrates is that it's just a lot of work.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:29.060]   And I want to thank all of you, because you sacrificially gave your time and invested.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.860]   And sometimes people say, you know, "Is this for you?"
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:36.380]   And in a sense, I think it is for us in the sense we learn so much.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.420]   And is it for us in the sense that we'll read it, yes, but we'll still read our Greek and
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Hebrew Bibles.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.360]   I know that for sure.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.620]   But I know for you guys, it was for people you'll never meet until heaven.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:53.560]   And you are striving to give them a translation that would minister to the church for years
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.740]   and years to come, and it was your labor of love.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.020]   So thank you.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.020]   Thank you for that.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:04.380]   And just hearing the insights that we have and can be attained through just that consistency
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.180]   and tying the whole Scripture together within a passage, it just shows how much we can go
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.180]   in depth in our Bible.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:14.460]   - And thank you, Abner, again, for being a taskmaster, but a genial taskmaster.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.460]   - And a genius.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.740]   - You smiled as you cracked the whip.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.700]   - We reflected behind your back that we love you as our leader, since you were the perfect
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.700]   leader.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.700]   - You guys are so kind.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.700]   - It was a delight of a project, I know that.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:31.500]   While it was hard work, and Paul, I mean, did a lot of the review and we're so grateful
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.620]   for that, but it was a delightful project.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.620]   - Yeah.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.620]   Praise God.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:40.100]   And I think it's our prayer then that this would be used by the church for years and
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.660]   years to come, and that people would use this in their ministry, and they'd use it to see
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:50.660]   great and wonderful things in God's Word, and may the Lord then just establish the work
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.540]   of His hands through this.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:55.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.060]   - Amen.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
