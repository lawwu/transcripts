[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Good Wednesday, everyone.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.400]   Thanks for listening.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.360]   And listening in this season,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.880]   we are in a season on the podcast looking at darker issues.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.680]   Not by design, it just ended up that way providentially
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.920]   based on the questions that have come to us
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.360]   and the topics that have been on the table of late.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.720]   We've looked at whether we can be angry at God
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300]   when life doesn't turn out the way we hoped it would.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.120]   That was two Mondays ago in ABJ 1828.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.660]   Then we looked at how to overcome anger in the home.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.120]   That was in ABJ 1829.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.840]   And then a wife asked about how to address her husband's
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   ongoing sin patterns in ABJ 1830.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.400]   And then last time we addressed a wife who was betrayed.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.020]   Her husband left her for another woman.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280]   How does she process the ongoing pain of that desertion?
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.300]   That was ABJ 1831.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.820]   And today I wanna build off Monday's episode
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.900]   because in speaking to that mom of three young girls
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.300]   now abandoned by her husband,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.000]   Pastor John applied the category of enemy
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.880]   and spoke of enemy love.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.220]   Those are Jesus's words, love your enemies, right?
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.820]   He commanded that to us in Matthew 544,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420]   a text Pastor John spent years studying.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.260]   He published an entire book by the title,
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.340]   Love Your Enemies.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.980]   This is his doctoral dissertation.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.860]   So if that enemy category fits a former spouse,
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.380]   it raised a question in my mind as I listened Monday
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.620]   and maybe in your mind too,
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.580]   who else qualifies as our enemy?
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580]   How broadly does this category stretch?
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.720]   And that exact question is answered by Pastor John
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.540]   in his 1995 sermon on Matthew chapter five.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.380]   Here he is.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.540]   - Around this globe today,
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.380]   there are tens of thousands of Christians suffering
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.860]   and some of them laying down their lives just to believe,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.420]   just to believe and to be obedient to Jesus Christ.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380]   So the first meaning of enemy
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.720]   is those who persecute you like that.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.780]   Love them, love them.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.980]   The next meaning of enemy is less dramatic
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.300]   in verse 45, about halfway through it says,
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.380]   God causes his son to rise on the evil and the good
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340]   and he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.620]   So here you have evil people and unrighteous people.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.980]   And this morning, it was already getting light
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.040]   at 4.45 this morning.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.360]   He's making the sun rise on all the evil people
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.620]   in the Western hemisphere here.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.620]   From Argentina to the Hudson Bay,
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.700]   millions of millions of people who scorn the name of God.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.020]   And he made the sun come up on him this morning
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.900]   and he gave them breath and he gave them life
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.420]   and he held the planet in being.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.740]   And he restrained anarchy and he graced them
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.860]   with warmth on their skin, breezes on their faces
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.020]   and green in the tree and grass under their feet
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.340]   and birds singing in the trees.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.420]   And you know what was happening when that happened?
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.500]   The heavens were telling the glory of God
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.360]   and the firmament was declaring his handiwork
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.980]   so that you here would hear this message
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.860]   before you got here.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.020]   And that's what I was praying for you this morning.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.300]   I looked outside and I said,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.780]   God, you're already preaching it.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.100]   Preach it, preach it.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.980]   Would you please open their hearts?
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.340]   Don't let them turn on the TV and just start watching stuff.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.700]   Would you turn on their hearts?
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.780]   Would you cause them to reach up
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.180]   and turn on the dial of the sky and say, do it, say it.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.100]   Say it to the cities.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.940]   Say it loud.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.900]   Nobody deserves what happened this morning at five o'clock.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.460]   Nobody.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.460]   And he made it happen.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.540]   He just brought it up.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.740]   And look, he's still doing it.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.740]   He's still doing it.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.420]   There are people who didn't give him a rip this morning.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.940]   They didn't give him the time of day.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.700]   He doesn't get two seconds of their day.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.220]   And he's just gracing them, hugging them,
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.300]   caressing them all day long today.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.260]   They'll go to lakes and they'll take walks
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.860]   and they'll ride bicycles.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.020]   And he'll be saying, I love you.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.180]   Come to me, look at me.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.740]   I'm a glorious God.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.220]   I can do this for eternity for you if you'll have me.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.940]   And they don't pay any attention.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.740]   We need witnesses to the witness.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.020]   The enemy in this context is those who resist God,
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.220]   who disobey his laws, who ignore him.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.300]   So if you translate that down into our situation,
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.540]   your enemy is anybody who resists you,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.340]   who contradicts you, who crosses you,
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.260]   who antagonizes you, who makes life hard for you.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.300]   Which means that the command, love your enemy,
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.860]   has an application to rebellious children,
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.660]   ill-tempered and insensitive and non-listening husbands,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.220]   neighbors who complain about your dandelions.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.540]   And you may not call them enemies
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.160]   and they don't call themselves enemies,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940]   but that's the kind of illustration we've got here.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.100]   Most people don't think of themselves as enemies of God.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.340]   And yet God uses them as illustrations
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.860]   of how he graces people who are not whole toward him.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.820]   A third illustration of what enemies means
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.460]   comes in verse 47.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.260]   If you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.580]   You know, even the tax collectors do the same.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.460]   And if you greet your brothers only,
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.780]   what do you do more than others?
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.140]   So who's the enemy here?
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.580]   Why is he using this in the context of enemy love?
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.340]   And the answer is your enemy is somebody
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.140]   who doesn't love you.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.380]   If you love only those who love you,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.380]   meaning you should also love those who don't love you.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.780]   Or if you greet only your brothers,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.500]   meaning you should also greet those
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.380]   who are your non-brothers.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.300]   So enemy here in this paragraph is thick.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.940]   It starts with persecution
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.940]   and it ends with people who don't greet you,
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.100]   not your brothers, they kind of, that's Shabbat.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.020]   He says, "If you only greet them,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.780]   then you don't know enemy love."
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.700]   So if I ask now in a summary fashion,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.540]   who are the enemies?
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.140]   What's this text about?
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.980]   This text is about anybody that crosses your path.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.020]   Love them and don't stop loving them
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.140]   even if they offend you,
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.420]   even if they dishonor you,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.620]   even if they anger you, disappoint you,
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.660]   frustrate you, threaten you, or kill you.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.100]   Don't stop loving them.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.100]   And if you just look in the mirror for a moment,
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.900]   the mirror of this word here,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.100]   you will feel like,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.140]   I am spring loaded to return evil for evil.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.100]   We feel it in our families especially.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.860]   People we know best can irritate us the most
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.940]   and we just, just like that,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.740]   we're returning evil for evil.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.180]   A harsh word gets a harsh word.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.820]   A criticism gets a criticism.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.780]   A complaint gets a complaint.
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.420]   We just, just like that,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.940]   we're just wired to return evil for evil,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.940]   which means this call is for a very profound change.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.540]   Isn't it?
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.380]   - Exactly.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.940]   We're wired to return evil for evil.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.740]   I pulled this clip from John Piper's 1995 sermon titled,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.100]   "But I Say to You, Love Your Enemies, Part Two."
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.460]   You can find the entire message online, both parts.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.500]   And being wired to return evil for evil
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.620]   was a text that came up
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.860]   in one of our most controversial episodes in the podcast,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.580]   the one on guns in the home.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.340]   You might remember that back in APJ 306.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.180]   I'm reminded of that as I listened to this episode.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.020]   Well, if you have a sermon clip to share of your own,
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.600]   email me, give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.220]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.180]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.420]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.460]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.260]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.900]   Well, do we submit ourselves to every person?
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.540]   We have a Bible question on 1 Peter 2.13
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.940]   that needs to get sorted out.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.780]   I'm your host Tony Reinke
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.580]   and we're rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.340]   when we dive into 1 Peter 2.13 on Friday.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.260]   We'll see you then.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:24.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
