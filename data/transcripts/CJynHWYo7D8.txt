[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   [Silence]
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.640]   Because of the structure of alcohol,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.680]   it is what's called both water-soluble and fat-soluble.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.360]   Translated into what's meaningful for you,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.680]   what that means is when you drink alcohol,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.400]   it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.740]   It has no trouble just passing right into those cells.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.680]   So unlike a lot of substances and drugs
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   that actually attach to the surface of cells,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.200]   to receptors as they're called, little parking spots,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.320]   and then trigger a bunch of downstreams,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.680]   like domino cascades of effects,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.560]   alcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.280]   because it can really just pass into those cells.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.800]   So it's water and fat-soluble,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.000]   and the fact that it can pass into so many organs and cells
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.280]   so easily is really what explains its damaging effects.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.840]   I should mention that there are three main types of alcohol.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.280]   There's isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.400]   and only the last one, ethyl alcohol or ethanol,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.280]   is fit for human consumption.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.320]   However, it is still toxic, okay?
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.720]   It produces substantial stress and damage to cells.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.160]   I'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.720]   but that's just a fact.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200]   Ethanol produces substantial damage to cells,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.560]   and it does that because when you ingest ethanol,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.360]   it has to be converted into something else
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.460]   because it is toxic to the body.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.920]   And there's a molecule inside of all of us called NAD,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.520]   and you may have heard of NAD because it's quite popular.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.980]   There's a lot of discussion about NAD
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.840]   in the longevity literature right now.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.500]   NAD is present in all our cells from birth until death.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.240]   The levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.560]   There are ideas that increasing levels of NAD
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   may extend lifespan.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.120]   A lot of that is still controversial,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.720]   or at least we should say is ongoing
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   in terms of the research.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360]   But nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.000]   NAD and related biochemical pathways
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.280]   are involved in converting that ethanol
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.880]   into something called acetyl aldehyde.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.360]   It's broken down into acetyl aldehyde.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.960]   And if you thought ethanol was bad,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.760]   acetyl aldehyde is particularly bad.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.800]   Acetyl aldehyde is poison.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.880]   It will kill cells.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.480]   It damages and kills cells,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   and it is indiscriminate as to which cells
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.800]   it damages and kills.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680]   Now, that's a problem, obviously,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   and the body deals with that problem
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.240]   by using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.520]   to convert acetyl aldehyde into something called acetate.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.800]   Acetate is actually something
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040]   that your body can use as fuel.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.280]   And that process of going from ethanol
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.080]   to acetyl aldehyde to acetate
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   does involve the production of a toxic molecule, right?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.440]   Again, acetyl aldehyde is really toxic.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920]   And NAD, and if we want to get technical,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.320]   it's the NAD to NADH ratio.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.160]   And that chemical step
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   is the rate-limiting step to ethanol's metabolism.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   What does that mean for you?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   What that means is that if your body
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   can't do this conversion of ethanol
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.000]   to acetyl aldehyde to acetate fast enough,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.360]   well, acetyl aldehyde will build up in your body
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000]   and cause more damage.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880]   So it's important that your body
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.640]   be able to do this conversion very quickly.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000]   And the place where it does that is within the liver.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400]   And cells within the liver
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.480]   are very good at this conversion process,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.800]   but they are cells and they are exposed
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.440]   to the acetyl aldehyde in the conversion process.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so cells within the liver really take a beating
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.240]   in the alcohol metabolism events.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   So the key thing to understand here
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.280]   is that when you ingest alcohol,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.200]   you are, yes, ingesting a poison,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.560]   and that poison is converted
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.280]   into an even worse poison in your body.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   And some percentage of that worse poison
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.320]   is converted into a form of calories
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.040]   that you can use to generate energy, generate ATP.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.320]   And the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   is because that entire process
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.560]   is very metabolically costly,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.920]   but there's no real nutritive value
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   of the calories that it creates.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.120]   You can use it for immediate energy,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.440]   but it can't be stored
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.640]   in any kind of meaningful or beneficial way.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.280]   It doesn't provide any vitamins.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.960]   It doesn't provide any amino acids.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.840]   It doesn't provide any fatty acids.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.720]   It's truly empty calories.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.800]   I know some people talk about sugar as empty calories,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.480]   but sugar actually is a far better fuel source
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.000]   than alcohol or acetate.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.920]   But nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.080]   some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.520]   and some is being shuttled into a fuel source.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.240]   Now, the important thing to understand
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.080]   is that it is the poison, the acetyl aldehyde itself,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.600]   that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.880]   I think most people don't realize that,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.200]   that being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.160]   in the way that your neural circuits work.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.800]   And so we should ask ourselves,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.080]   which neural circuits, what brain areas,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.640]   what body areas involved in feeling drunk or inebriated?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.760]   In thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.560]   and what it's doing to the body,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.920]   what it's doing in all cases
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.960]   is it's consumed into the gut, right?
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   Goes into the stomach.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   The liver immediately starts this conversion
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.560]   that we talked about before
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.800]   of ethanol to acetyl aldehyde to acetate.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.000]   And some amount of acetyl aldehyde and acetate
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.120]   are making it into the brain.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.600]   It crosses the blood-brain barrier.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.520]   Again, the brain has this fence around it
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.040]   that we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.600]   Many things, most things, thankfully,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.740]   can't pass across the blood-brain barrier,
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.980]   but alcohol, because it's water and fat soluble,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.980]   just cruises right across this fence
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.160]   and into the milieu, the environment of the brain,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   which is made up of a couple of different major cell types,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.580]   neurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells,
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.560]   which are in between the nerve cells.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   And we'll talk about the effects on each of those soon.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.480]   So what happens when alcohol gets into the brain
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.040]   that makes us feel tipsy or drunk?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.920]   And in some people, makes people feel really,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.980]   especially energized and happy.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.840]   Well, alcohol is indiscriminate
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.480]   in terms of which brain areas it goes to.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.920]   Again, it doesn't bind to particular receptors,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.880]   but it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.520]   for particular brain areas that are involved
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.240]   in certain kinds of thinking and behavior.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.360]   So one of the first things that happens
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.120]   is that there's a slight,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.040]   at least after the first drink or second drink,
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.560]   there's a slight suppression in the activity of neurons
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.200]   This is an area of your neocortex
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.260]   that's involved in thinking and planning,
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.260]   and perhaps above all,
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.460]   in suppression of impulsive behavior.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.340]   So if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.900]   and people are consuming drinks,
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   what you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.180]   the volume of people's voices will increase.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.380]   And that's because people are simply not paying attention
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.620]   to their voice modulation.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.360]   As other people start speaking more loudly,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.580]   other people are speaking more loudly.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.780]   We've all had this experience, right?
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.220]   Of going to a party and then you step outside for a moment
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.620]   and you go, "Oh my goodness, I was shouting."
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.360]   You come home the next day, you got a sore throat.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.140]   It might be that you picked up some sort of bug,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.540]   some virus or something.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.460]   But oftentimes it's just the fact
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.020]   you've been shouting all night just to be heard
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.440]   because as the prefrontal cortex shuts down,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.000]   people stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.360]   Also notice that people start gesticulating more.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   People will start standing up and sitting down more.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.800]   They'll start walking around more.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.640]   If there's music on,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   people might spontaneously start dancing.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.160]   All of this is because these areas
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.120]   of the prefrontal cortex normally are providing
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.960]   what's called top-down inhibition.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.080]   They are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.720]   onto various parts of the brain.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.620]   They're involved in impulsive motor behavior
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.880]   and thought patterns.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.960]   And as you shut down the prefrontal cortex,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.560]   that GABAergic suppression of impulses
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.400]   starts to be released.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.360]   So people will say things that they want to say
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.300]   without so much forethought about what they're saying.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.720]   Or they might do things that they want to do
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.840]   without really thinking it through quite as much.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.240]   Or they might not even remember thinking it through at all
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.200]   or experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.600]   We haven't talked about blacking out yet
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.520]   in the effects of alcohol on memory.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.480]   But as long as we're there,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   I'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   in suppressing the neural networks
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.120]   that are involved in memory formation and storage.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.920]   This is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.720]   if we've been drinking.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.460]   One of the more important things to know
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.920]   about the effects of alcohol in the brain
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.780]   is this disruption in top-down inhibition,
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.760]   but also that areas of the brain
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.600]   that are involved in flexible behavior,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.120]   sort of considering different options.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.600]   Like I could do A or I could do B.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.400]   I could say this to them or I could say that.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.560]   I could say it in that way or I could say it in this way.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.480]   This might be a little more tactful.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.640]   Those brain areas basically shut down entirely
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   and people just tend to say what they want to say.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520]   So the key thing to understand is that when people drink,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.120]   the prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.400]   That is habitual behavior and impulsive behavior
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.040]   starts to increase.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.120]   Now, what's interesting is this is true in the short term.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.600]   So after people have one or two,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.200]   maybe three or four drinks,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.960]   but it's also true that the more often that people drink,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.480]   there are changes in the very circuits
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.300]   that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.
