[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.480]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.200]   also building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.560]   On today's show, I welcome back past guest of Radical Personal Finance, James Wesley
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.280]   Rawls.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.760]   Jim is an author, most famously of the largest survival website on the internet called Survival
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760]   Blog.com.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.120]   He's also written a series of novels.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.360]   He comes from a military background and also has a deep level of expertise in survivalism
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360]   and preparedness.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.480]   But he also, most interestingly for today's show, has a deep level of expertise on the
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.240]   subject of firearms.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.880]   Specifically, I've invited him on today to discuss how to invest in guns, how you can
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.240]   diversify your investments by purchasing, owning, trading, investing in guns.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.680]   I'm really excited to bring this show to you because I think it will be practically useful
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.960]   to those of you who wish to pursue this course of action.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.640]   It will also be theoretically interesting to those of you who are just interested in
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.040]   considering investment markets.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.720]   I think guns are a unique asset class.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   This episode advances one of my major agendas with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.840]   Over time, my hope is that I can change the way that people in general think about investing.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400]   Over time, I'd like to undo a lot of the marketing work of the financial world.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.560]   Today, if I say "investment" to the average person on the street, they automatically think
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.520]   of something like a mutual fund held within a retirement account.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.840]   Now, although that is one perfectly valid way to think about investing, that's primarily
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.240]   a concept that has been sold to you systematically by the financial industry over the last few
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   decades.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   That's not the only way to invest, and it's not even necessarily the best way to invest.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.120]   It's simply one way to invest that has certain attributes, certain characteristics, but there
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.560]   are many other ways to invest.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.520]   I like to profile some of those different approaches to investing, which is why I'm
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.560]   excited to bring you today's episode.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.360]   Guns are unique, and I love thinking about the marketplace from an investment perspective
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.520]   because of some of the underlying characteristics.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.560]   So before I play the interview, I want to talk with you about seven interesting characteristics
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.280]   of the firearms marketplace that you should consider and consider how they apply to your
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.760]   own situation with possibly your interest in investing in guns or how they apply to
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:30.920]   other types of marketplaces that you see around you that might be more familiar to you.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.040]   First thing I'd like to discuss is the underlying value and floor of an investment.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.500]   One fear that many people have about investing in certain types of assets is that somehow
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.520]   the marketplace could disintegrate and the value of that asset could be driven to zero.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.860]   Now a lot of times this fear is unfounded.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.680]   For example, if you invest in the assets of a company through purchasing shares of its
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.760]   stock, it's a rare company which would actually fall to a value of zero in the marketplace.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.920]   Most companies have some level of equipment and physical plant and equipment, things that
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.560]   could be sold at a bankruptcy auction to have some underlying value.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   Not all companies.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.960]   Some companies are simply primarily their value is composed of intellectual property
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.720]   rights and if for some reason those intellectual property rights become worthless, well then
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.280]   theoretically the value of the stock could plummet to zero or perhaps as the investor
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.800]   and owner of a company, the company could acquire so much debt that the creditors would
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.740]   take any value of the company before you were to receive any residual value.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.320]   So it is possible that stocks can decline in value to zero but it's unlikely for most
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.320]   well-run companies.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.720]   But it's often hard for people to visualize this when thinking about paper-based assets
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.640]   like stocks and bonds, things like that.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.480]   But there are many other ways where you can see the underlying floor and this is one very
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.940]   attractive feature of firearms.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.820]   Guns have today and as far as I can tell will always have some underlying intrinsic value
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.200]   as a tool.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.080]   That tool might be for the purpose of hunting food, defending yourself from physical attack
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.640]   or simply a tool for fun by engaging in various aspects of the shooting sports.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.200]   But that underlying value as a tool, the intrinsic value, leads to their having a fascinating
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.480]   price floor because of their utility.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   Now this is a unique characteristic and it's something I think we should pay attention
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.320]   to when considering investments.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.280]   There are other items you could invest in that have that feature.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.560]   For example, a functioning automobile is always going to have at least a certain value.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.120]   I don't know what that market value is in your area but where I live, if a car works,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.840]   you can always sell it for at least 500 bucks.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.800]   If it gets you from point A to point B, who knows how long it's going to do that.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   But if it gets you there, it's going to be at least worth 500 bucks.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.960]   In Florida, bonus points if the AC works, that adds another 500 bucks to your value.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   A car with a working AC has a price floor of 1,000 bucks.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   It doesn't matter how ugly, how reliable, you can sell it for 1,000 bucks if it has
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   a working air conditioning.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.020]   But automobiles generally tend to degrade over time.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.760]   There are other things that you could do as well.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.320]   I've always been fascinated by the market for physical coins.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.280]   One of the benefits of some aspects of the coin marketplace is you have an underlying
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.760]   floor of value based upon the currency value of your investment.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.560]   For example, if you're purchasing US currency pre-1965, US silver dimes, quarters and half
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.580]   dollars, well, the value of those coins is primarily going to be driven by the melt value
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.000]   of the silver marketplace.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.580]   But if the value of silver were to plummet to effectively zero because all of the demand
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.780]   for silver disappeared, those coins have an underlying floor of value based upon their
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.160]   face value.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.120]   A dime is always going to be worth at least 10 cents as long as the US economy and world
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   economy is functioned and denominated in terms of dollars.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.780]   Or today, some people invest in physical nickels for the same purpose.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.560]   They have a melt value of a certain number based upon the value of the physical nickel
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.720]   as a commodity, but they always are worth at least five cents as a currency.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.020]   This is an interesting floor.
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.520]   This is not only applicable to coins or guns.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.600]   You could do this – you could find this in land and buildings.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.680]   When you own a rental house, that rental house always has a certain value based upon its
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.360]   utility as shelter, either shelter that you can rent or sell.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.040]   As long as people need or want shelter, it's going to have a certain value.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.800]   If you own a warehouse, it's going to have a certain value as large shelter for a business
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   that needs a warehouse.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.920]   Raw land might have a basic value partly judged by the marketplace, its desirability in a
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.240]   certain climate, what's going on in the local economy.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.120]   But if it has timber on it, there's a certain value simply based upon your being able to
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.820]   harvest and sell the timber.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.020]   You can apply this to other types of tools.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.640]   A snap-on wrench to a mechanic is always going to have some certain residual value as a high-quality
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   tool.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.220]   I was fascinated a few years ago when preparing for the birth of our first baby.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:35.040]   My wife and I were buying cloth diapers and I couldn't believe that a used cloth diaper
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.780]   has an incredibly high residual value.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.540]   Blew my mind.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:48.400]   Used cloth diapers have an extremely high residual value when measured against their
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.020]   new purchase price.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.020]   Amazing.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.360]   If you want to cloth diaper your kid, you can sell all your diapers out at the end of
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.240]   your kids using them for a very high value proportionally speaking.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:08.740]   So this fundamental underlying value is something we should look for and guns have that.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.060]   They have that historically.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.300]   Historically guns are the great leveling influence in human society.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.500]   A gun is what makes a weak 80-year-old woman capable to defend herself against an aggressor
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   or a young lady.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.700]   A gun makes her powerful against a stronger male attacker.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.120]   If you look at the history of liberty and freedom throughout the world, widespread gun
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.820]   ownership promotes a healthy respect for the general population by those who wish to be
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.100]   a part of the ruling class.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.620]   It's a fascinating historical study when you go and study different cultures as they've
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.620]   developed.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:46.020]   So there's a long market and even today, guns will always find a ready market value
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:52.660]   at some price at the gun shows or pawn shops or back alleys of every city of the world.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.060]   This is unique as an investment attribute.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.380]   It's kind of hard to walk into a pawn shop and sell a few shares of stock, but it's
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:08.860]   pretty easy to walk into a pawn shop and get a low but practical price on the sale of any
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.420]   firearm.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   Guns are also interesting.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.040]   My second point in that they have a unique and incredible durability.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.740]   As a physical item, they have an incredible durability.
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.780]   When cared for and prepared properly for protection against the physical elements, a gun is a
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.860]   physical item that can be sealed up in a vault for 100 years or more and that gun will emerge
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:35.540]   as fully capable of its intended purpose as it is today.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.780]   I own a pistol that my grandfather wore on his belt every day as a rancher in the mountains
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.860]   of Colorado 75 years ago and it shoots just as well today as it did then.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.340]   I own a rifle that he used to harvest deer for, feed his family, and it functions every
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.060]   bit as reliably today as it did then.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.980]   If I want to take it out hunting, it will work just as well.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   Interesting thing, there is a subcategory in the gun marketplace of machine guns.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:07.940]   Most of these fully automatic machine guns are decades old, but their values is huge.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.340]   Their values are huge simply based upon the legislation that governs them.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:18.140]   Third point about investing in guns is there are many ways to access the gun market for
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.420]   investment purposes at various dollar amounts.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.580]   Just no matter how much money you would actually like to invest in guns, in today's interview,
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.380]   you're going to find out some ways to do it.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.940]   Rawls discusses in today's interview how you can speculate on – if you'd like to
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:40.180]   speculate, you can speculate on the impact of future government legislation of paramilitary
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.980]   style semi-automatic sporting rifles with the ownership of a $19 part.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:52.220]   So if you want to invest 100 bucks and speculate on what the US government will do with regard
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.300]   to gun control legislation, you can get into it for 19 bucks.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:03.540]   Now if you think that – so if you predict future more restrictive gun laws, you might
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.220]   want to pay attention to that way of doing it.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.700]   Or if you've got more money to work with, you could easily invest a few thousand bucks
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.980]   just into purchasing some rifles or you could put tens of thousands of dollars to work in
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.180]   the ownership and trading of fully automatic rifles and machine guns if you're willing
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.220]   to deal with the paperwork requirements of them.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.400]   Another interesting feature to guns is they can be very compact and portable.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.520]   You could relatively easily store $50,000 or $100,000 worth of firearms in a large home
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.500]   safe in your spare bedroom.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.740]   If needed, you could transport that high dollar value of property in the trunk of a large
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.780]   car or the back of an SUV or a pickup truck.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:47.100]   It's a little bit different as far as the compactness of wealth than say purchasing
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.320]   a house.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.240]   So there's an interesting dynamic to the portability and the compact nature and ability
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.140]   to store wealth.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.480]   Fifth, guns have an almost infinite level of specialization.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:08.420]   So as a marketplace, it's fascinating to consider it in the aggregate as far as guns,
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.260]   which is a somewhat nondescriptive term, versus certain types of guns.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:19.180]   It's a perfect market into which you can apply specialized knowledge to gain a competitive
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.740]   advantage.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:27.860]   Sixth, guns have the unique feature of generally always being in high demand.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.600]   Personally, it's a rare gun owner that I know who owns only one.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.300]   So there's always a strong market among existing gun owners.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.100]   I know some of you are international listeners and the markets in your country are different
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.660]   than they are in the United States of America.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.540]   But there's generally a strong market.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.760]   Although I'm sure they must exist somewhere, I've never personally met anyone who, after
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.860]   owning a gun or multiple guns, generally voluntarily becomes a non-gun owner.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.900]   Sure, people get rid of guns.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.760]   But if you look at the weapons collected in gun buyback programs, you usually find some
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:09.260]   intelligent business people trading in worthless, inoperable hunks of junk to their local police
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:14.060]   department in exchange for some very useful cash or gift cards if that's what they're
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060]   using.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.340]   So here's a little market tip for you.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.460]   If you ever hear of your local police department holding a gun buyback program, get some cash
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.020]   together and set up – grab a table and go use it.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.820]   See if you can make some money.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.700]   What a lot of gun owners do is when the local police department is having a gun buyback
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.580]   program, they'll come down and set up a table and offer people cash, more cash than
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.820]   the local police department is offering for their – for the gun buyback.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.980]   So you can often – if there is anyone selling in a weapon that actually works or is worth
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.860]   having, you can usually get it at a nice price and get yourself a good gun at a great discount.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.180]   Plus, you can consider yourself to be doing your patriotic duty by getting that gun off
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.300]   the street and safely sequestering it into your safe, keeping it out of the hands of
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.140]   criminals.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:07.600]   Or another little interesting marketplace thing, if the police department is offering
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.860]   a lot of money, sometimes it can be worth it to go buy cheap guns from a different market
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.460]   and sell them into the buyback program in order to make some money.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.980]   There are some great stories of that happening at an Oakland, California gun buyback program
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.740]   back in 2008 where a bunch of gun owners went and purchased guns at another market for cheap
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.540]   and they were – I think they were paying 250 bucks for them and they sold them all
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.600]   to the police department, 250 bucks, and took some nice cash.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.500]   So just pay attention for those little markets.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.540]   As in anything, there's always interesting times to buy and to sell.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.780]   Seventh attribute of the gun market, which I think is very fascinating, is it's a market
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:49.220]   that's subject to external influence, specifically legislative influence.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.040]   Jim and I discussed this at the very beginning of today's interview, which is why I wanted
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.780]   to release this interview to you now in a timely manner because it will make a fascinating
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.580]   case study as we watch what happens in the next year or so.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.580]   Now as with any marketplace, you should pay attention and think about the gun marketplace
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.960]   as a way to analyze the risks.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.820]   For example, if you go out and buy guns, you have to know what you're buying.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.740]   You have to build and rely on your own knowledge and skill or you have to establish a relationship
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.820]   with a trusted broker, somebody that you can count on to help you with their knowledge
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.220]   and skill.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.020]   You have to physically protect your investment.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.420]   This is something that we're not generally accustomed to thinking of.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:36.580]   We only think of it when our bank gets hacked or our brokerage company gets subjected to
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.420]   a criminal operation that's trying to deal with them.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.040]   But you have to physically protect your investment.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.420]   You have to know the market and there are very large market risks.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.140]   For example, you might misread the legislative direction in your country.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.140]   What's the trend?
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:58.060]   Is it toward tighter restrictions on gun ownership or looser restrictions on gun ownership?
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.700]   You would have to calculate technological changes.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.180]   Certain types of guns might be more valued in the future than others or you'd have to
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.220]   calculate the impact of 3D printing on your investment portfolio.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.220]   A decade from now, maybe a little more, maybe a little less.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.420]   I'm just speculating on the timing but probably a decade from now, any of us who desires to
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.900]   can mass produce our own guns on the 3D printers in our spare bedrooms.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.940]   So how will that impact the market value of your investments?
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:33.860]   A more typical question, how will that impact the market value of your guns or any of your
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:41.320]   investment portfolio, any asset class simply as it adjusts the political tone of the world?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.980]   How does 3D printing impact the control and imposition of tyranny by governments around
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.980]   the world?
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   I have no idea.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.740]   You have to figure that out.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.260]   So some of these features are unique to the gun market and some are not.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.900]   I'll try to cover other interesting markets in the future.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.140]   I'm trying to get my mechanic to come on.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.820]   He's got a $180,000 Porsche sitting in the back of his garage and I want to talk about
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.220]   investing in classic cars and things like that.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.700]   There's all these interesting markets and whether or not you care to participate, I
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.300]   don't personally care to do anything with cars.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.360]   That interests me not the least.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.220]   Still study a market and then look around you and think about how you can apply that
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.220]   knowledge.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:29.140]   But today in light of the forthcoming presidential elections, I'd like to discuss with you how
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:36.380]   to diversify your investment portfolio by investing in guns.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.260]   Jim Rawls, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.260]   >>Jim Rawls: Thank you so much for having me on.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.260]   >>Aaron Powell, House of Representatives Spokesman>>
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.340]   So we're going to tackle a topic that I think is very exciting and is sure to anger some
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.980]   people and sure to intrigue many.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:55.100]   But I want to talk about guns, specifically the topic of investing in guns.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.900]   Although I've owned guns and shot guns for a very long time, I'm an absolute neophyte
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:05.420]   when it comes to the ability to assess the value, the ability to understand the marketplace,
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.420]   etc.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.860]   In light of the forthcoming presidential election, I feel like this is an interesting time to
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:18.180]   tackle the topic because depending on what happens, it could affect the values of guns.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.380]   So I said, "Well, who better to discuss this topic than one of the most knowledgeable men
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.620]   I know, Jim Rawls?"
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.780]   So thank you for being willing to do this interview with me.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.780]   >>Jim Rawls: Sure.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.500]   I'm happy to be here to do this.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:36.140]   I want to start out with the caveat that nobody knows what's going to happen at the upcoming
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:44.500]   presidential conventions, the campaign conventions for the two major parties.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:51.060]   I think that it's very likely that Hillary Clinton is going to get nominated despite
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.260]   the fact that she should really be in prison.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:20:01.100]   If she does, I can predict that immediately after she's nominated, there will be a realization
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.860]   nationwide that she will probably win the election and that when she gets in office,
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.020]   she's going to try to enact a lot of so-called gun control measures.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.340]   I like to refer to them as civilian disarmament measures.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:23.140]   So I have a feeling, it's just a gut level feeling and it's based on many years of experience
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:34.740]   as a firearms trader, that the price of most black rifles and their magazines and the ammunition
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:44.620]   in those primary battle rifle calibers like 5.56 NATO, 7.62 NATO, 7.62 by 39, which is
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:52.540]   the AK-47 cartridge, and 5.45 by 39, which is the AK-74 cartridge.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.940]   Basically everything is going to double in price and the availability will become very,
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.940]   very limited.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.420]   There will be basically a run on everything.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:09.140]   The stores will get cleaned out, at least of all the military calibers and the main
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.540]   defensive handgun calibers.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:19.820]   High capacity or what I refer to as standard capacity magazines will be very hard to find.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.860]   And again, basically across the board, I think prices are going to double on selected items.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:32.820]   So it's wise, if I was in a situation where I was a stock picker and I knew for certain
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.860]   that a company was going to be releasing a new product and it was going to double the
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.420]   value of that stock, I would want to publicize it, right?
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.540]   Well, of course, I'd want to invest myself first.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.420]   And then publicize it.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:54.500]   And I'm kind of in that situation right now with firearms in that I can see the handwriting
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   on the wall.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.540]   I've seen what's happened in the past when there have been crises where it has the Democrat
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:07.140]   Party and the mass media, their buddies, all screaming for more gun control.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.860]   The first thing that happens is that everybody rushes to the gun shows, they rush to the
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:16.900]   gun store, everything gets cleaned out, prices get jacked up, and people are frantic.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.980]   So in my line of business, which is the preparedness business, I like to say panic now and avoid
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   the rush.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.180]   And instead of really panicking, people need to very dispassionately just think about what
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.740]   they need for their own families, think in terms of both your immediate family and also
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:44.540]   your future, your progeny, the future generations, what your descendants are going to need and
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.180]   stock up accordingly.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.060]   And then with any extra money that you have for investing for guns that you plan to actually
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:58.100]   turn over, try to buy guns that are going to be in the highest demand and the shortest
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.380]   supply.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.380]   It's just common sense.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.420]   So before we go to the specific practical application, I want to talk a little bit about
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420]   the market.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.660]   And for the sake of the record, you and I are recording this on April 22, 2016.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.540]   So as you said, we don't know anything about what's going to happen at upcoming political
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.540]   conventions.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.660]   We don't know what's going to happen with the presidential candidates.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.340]   We don't know what scandals are going to emerge.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.700]   We don't know if the FBI is going to announce their findings on Hillary Clinton, all these
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700]   things.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:34.620]   I'll tell you, I think that if anyone could ever be elected president while under indictment
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:40.460]   or after conviction and a presidential pardon, it's probably Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.820]   I believe it.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.720]   So I have been – I mean for quite a while, I've simply assumed personally for the sake
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.740]   of my own purposes, I've assumed that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.860]   And who knows what will happen with the political makeup of Congress and of the Senate.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860]   But I've just assumed –
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.780]   Yeah, the Supreme Court.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.480]   But I've assumed for my own planning purposes that Hillary Clinton will win and at the moment
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.800]   I have no reason to assume anything else.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.640]   But I also recognize that I could be wrong and that's where I want to talk about because
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:19.460]   in my mind, the firearms marketplace demonstrates exactly the challenge.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.260]   Here's what I see as a layperson and I want to ask you this question.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.200]   On the one hand, it would seem easy for me to predict that, OK, if Hillary Clinton wins
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:35.160]   the presidency, then there will be a barrage of new restrictions and gun laws, et cetera,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:41.960]   which would lead to additional restrictions on the acquisition of certain types of firearms
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:47.420]   and therefore because of the decreased supply, the demand will rise and thus the price will
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420]   rise.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.620]   But the major concerns that I have are threefold.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.380]   One, historically, we've gone through these ebbs and flows.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.840]   So I'm only 30 years old.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.500]   So I went back during Bill Clinton and the Brady campaign and things like that.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.420]   I was not practically aware.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:10.140]   I studied those things as a matter of history rather than as a matter of actual experience.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.840]   But it's been difficult for me to discern the actual historical record.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.060]   On the one hand, it seems like many people are constantly clamoring for additional restrictions
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.380]   on firearms ownership.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:27.900]   But when you actually look at the facts, specifically the best example on Wikipedia, there's a great
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.140]   animated map of – for example, the spread of the concealed carry laws.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.100]   It's just a march of freedom.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   Exactly.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.580]   So you've got this steady overturnment of laws.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.460]   When I look at the last eight years under President Obama and I just observe what has
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   happened, it's hard for me to imagine a political candidate who is – would like
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.200]   to do more.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.620]   But yet in practical reality, I'm not aware of any major substantive restrictions that
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.980]   have actually been put in place.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.140]   So I feel like most of what we see is political posturing.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:07.060]   So what if even though Hillary Clinton – let's assume she were elected, how do we know anything
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.540]   – how do we know she could actually do anything?
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.540]   Right.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:16.340]   Well, she could do a lot of things by executive order and that's completely absent any input
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.920]   from Congress or the courts.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.260]   So why hasn't President Obama done that then?
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.060]   I think Obama has been reluctant to do too many executive orders.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:35.820]   But I'm not sure if Clinton will have that same reluctance because she has an outlook
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.500]   on life that's very proactive.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:47.460]   If you look at the way she was involved behind the scenes with the predecessor of Obamacare,
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:53.220]   in the very first year of the Bill Clinton – the first Bill Clinton presidency, she
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:27:01.820]   was chairing the committee for a socialized medicine plan for the United States.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:08.820]   And in fact, the minutes of all those meetings have never been released.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.900]   But she was apparently very proactive.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.220]   She wanted it immediately and she was horribly disappointed when it didn't happen.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.620]   So I think that's her basic outlook.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.380]   She's proactive and I think she will push as hard and as fast as she can with executive
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.380]   orders.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:33.180]   Now, the executive orders will primarily involve imports because obviously she can't get involved
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.980]   because of the commerce clause and what goes on inside of each state.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.840]   But for importation, the presidential power is tremendous.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:50.560]   So for anyone who owns any European-made semi-automatic firearms, I strongly recommend that if you
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.100]   want a spare parts set, you order it now.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:00.620]   If you want any extra magazines, if you own a gun like a Steyr AUG or an Israeli Tavor
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:07.300]   or whatever, you need to get your spare parts and your extra magazines laid in soon because
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:13.260]   by executive order, Hillary Clinton could ban the importation of any magazine over ten
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.320]   rounds except for law enforcement purposes.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   That could very well happen.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.040]   So you're saying that I should encourage a relative of mine who's been lusting after
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.060]   the new Tavor bullpup to go ahead and pull the trigger and get one?
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   Yes, you should.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:30.900]   You can get one of the new X95s which is the Tavor with the improved trigger.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.020]   That's the gun to buy.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.340]   And right now, they're about $1,900.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   Stock up.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:44.220]   If he can afford to buy two or three, he really should because by buying just two of them,
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:49.140]   if the parts for those become import banned and they can no longer assemble them in the
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.740]   States, instead of a $2,000 rifle, it's going to become a $4,000 rifle.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.400]   He can then sell one of those two rifles and then be able to keep the other one effectively
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   for free.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.900]   So how confident do you feel?
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.740]   So let's say – and we're going to talk about this.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.740]   Don't worry.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.540]   I'm not just going to willy-nilly follow your advice.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.580]   But let's use me as an example.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.900]   Let's pretend that I'm not worrying necessarily at this point.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   We'll come back to this.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.200]   But I'm not planning to – I'm not planning and trying to prepare for the end of the world
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   as we know it.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.020]   I'm not trying to create an armory of many rifles of common things.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.220]   I just want to speculate on the gun market.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.580]   How confident would you feel in saying, "Hey, Josh.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.780]   We'll consider going out and buying a couple of the Tavor bullpups," and for those who
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.860]   aren't familiar with firearm nomenclature, this is a scary black rifle that shoots lots
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:43.340]   of bullets, which is extremely compact and extremely valuable for those who like to shoot.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.260]   Is that an accurate assessment?
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.300]   How confident would you feel in that investment advice?
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.380]   Josh Woodruff: I'd say that's a pretty good investment strategy, although in terms
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.260]   of absolute bang for the buck, in terms of things that will more than double in value
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.740]   if there is a perceived crisis, and I think there will be coming out of the Democratic
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.780]   Convention in the third week of July, starting the third week of July.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:13.420]   The thing to buy actually is, if you can find them, is stripped AR-15 lower receivers.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.780]   Right now they can be had for as low as $29 a piece.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:24.100]   During the last crisis, which was after the Sandy Hook shootings, they were going for
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100]   $250 a piece.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   That's a lot of money.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.100]   That's a lot of money.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.100]   It's not a large piece.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.100]   It's not a large piece.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.100]   It's not a large piece.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.100]   It's not a large piece.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   That's the most valuable.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.020]   The lower receiver on an AR-15 actually is just a trigger group.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.420]   It really isn't a receiver, but that's the part that many, many years ago, Eugene
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.300]   Stoner decided to stamp the serial number on and he referred to that group, which most
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.780]   people would refer to as a trigger group, as the lower receiver.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:55.820]   Technically, under the federal law, that receiver constitutes the firearm because that's
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.620]   the piece that carries the serial number.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:06.380]   You can build an AR-15 yourself without any special tools just from that lower receiver.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:12.020]   You can buy a complete barreled upper receiver and just slap together the gun.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.560]   The critical component, the one that's going to be in greatest demand, will be that lower
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   receiver.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:22.860]   Traditionally, they've sold for anywhere between $25 and $75 a piece, depending on
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.980]   the maker.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.620]   The supply has been very, very spotty.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:38.300]   During the 1994 to 2004 federal firearms ban, lower receivers were very hard to find.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:46.880]   Technically, with that ban, you would have to have assembled a gun before that law went
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.520]   into effect in 1994 to be able to legally possess it.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.960]   What a lot of people would do is just take ... They'd buy a bunch of lower receivers
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.220]   and then slap the same upper on that lower, lay it down on a newspaper and take a picture
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.220]   of it.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.380]   This is even before the days of digital photography.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:13.320]   With both the serial number showing and the date of the newspaper showing.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.560]   That was their proof that they had assembled that lower receiver before the law went into
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.680]   effect.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:28.800]   In this case, if we could end up with another ban on battle rifles, you could do something
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   very similar.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.240]   But the crucial item to have is that lower receiver itself.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.800]   Now, if you don't mind signing for them doing the federal paperwork, you can get them for
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.920]   as low as $19.95 a piece if you order them 10 at a time.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:50.160]   If you look around, you can find a local transfer dealer with a federal firearms license who
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.040]   will do transfers for 10% over cost.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.200]   That's very little money to do a lot of paperwork.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:05.960]   Say you wanted to invest $2,000 in 100 AR-15 stripped lower receivers.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.120]   Even if you don't have a federal firearms license of your own, you could probably get
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.880]   them for around $20 a piece.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.600]   If you're a real speculator, you'd go out and buy 100 of them.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.960]   Go ahead and sign for them.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.680]   I know you're developing a huge paper trail by doing this.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.480]   But the upside is if there is another buying frenzy following the Democrat convention in
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.280]   July of 2016, the price of stripped lower receivers will probably jump to somewhere
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.880]   between $200 and $300 a piece.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.920]   You would then, during the height of that frenzy, sell them back into the market and
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.240]   recoup a huge profit.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:56.480]   Paul Matzko: For some reason, one of the nice backups of that idea is if my recent
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.200]   experience over the last five to ten years with the firearms market is any indication,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:08.840]   all you need to do is – even if let's say you weren't gambling on election campaigns
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.440]   and let's say that – I don't know what.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.240]   I guess Ted Cruz were to win the presidency.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   Michael Munger: It's still like fixed inflation.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.560]   Paul Matzko: Yeah, you still have something that's valuable and then all you have to
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.080]   do is just simply wait for the next terrorist attack, the next mass shooting, whatever it
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:27.040]   is that the next thing which will come around every few years which will drive the market
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.200]   demand up and then you have a good floor.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.440]   Michael Munger: Yeah.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:38.160]   That's one of the beauties of free market economics is the ability to buy low and sell
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.120]   high and in my estimation, there is no such thing as hoarding.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:49.200]   If you're buying now when supplies are plentiful of anything, whether it's food, wheat grinders,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.600]   guns, ammunition or whatever, if you're buying now and the pipeline is still full,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.760]   then you can never be accused of hoarding.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.240]   There really is no such thing as hoarding in a true free market.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.120]   There are only buyers and sellers at a price point.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:11.200]   Trevor Burrus: I like the strategy you've outlined simply because even on the flip side,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.160]   let's say I bought 10 or 20 lower receivers.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.240]   I could systematically over time simply take those receivers and even if there were no
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.200]   resale value, even if I never wanted to sell them out, I could just over the course of
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.560]   coming years, use those receivers to assemble my own armory.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   Michael Munger: Sure.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.520]   Or you could set them aside for your future grandkids or whatever when they wouldn't be
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.160]   available without any paperwork.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.440]   Of course the ideal situation is to try to go to gun shows and find them laying on gun
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   show tables.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:49.160]   Occasionally, you will find complete lowers, even more rarely stripped lowers available
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.840]   on secondary sales with no paperwork but that is a rarity.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.200]   You're probably going to end up having to fill out a federal form 4473 which is the
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   dealer acquisition and sale form to take possession of those.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.640]   Now I want to kind of back up a little bit and encourage your listeners to get smart
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.360]   about the firearms market.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.640]   In a lot of ways, the firearms market is similar to the rare coin market and that is it's the
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:28.600]   savvy, the really astute buyers that make the most money trading in these commodities
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:36.840]   and the ignorant sheeple who are late to the market and not well informed, the sheep get
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.360]   shorn basically.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:47.400]   Those sheeple are not going to be well positioned to have the knowledge it takes to make a lot
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.320]   of money with firearms.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.800]   So I recommend that people get smart about firearms.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.400]   If you go to my website, it's survivalblog.com.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:01.720]   In the left hand bar, you'll see a list of links of static pages.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.840]   I have one that's titled "Book and Video Shelf".
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:13.560]   If you click on that, I have several recommendations for books that are available through amazon.com.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.720]   One of them is called "Flederman's Guide to Antique Firearms and Their Values".
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.680]   Great big fat book that gets updated once every two or three years with a tremendous
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.240]   wealth of information about antique guns.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.640]   Anybody who's considering buying a pre-1899 antique gun for investment purposes needs a
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   copy of that book.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.760]   For modern guns, I would recommend that you get the latest edition.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.440]   It's also at my bookshelf page.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.720]   It's called "The Blue Book of Gun Values".
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:53.880]   That is kind of considered the bible of firearms collecting for modern guns.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:38:00.080]   If you go to gun shows, you often see a copy of that laying right on the tables being used
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.280]   as a reference by the firearms dealers as they're assessing guns that are handed to
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.440]   them for potential purchase.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.520]   Again, "Flederman's Guide to Antique Firearms and Their Values" and "The Blue Book of Gun
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   Values".
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.120]   Those are the two key references that everyone should have.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:24.280]   Jim, why would somebody want to buy a 117+ year old gun?
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:36.000]   Okay, well, also at my website, I have a static page called "The Pre-1899 Antique Firearms
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   FAQ".
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.840]   It was a piece that I co-authored about the amazing little loophole, in fact, I really
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.480]   shouldn't even call it a loophole, the feature in American firearms laws that exempts firearms
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.160]   that were made in or before 1898.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.200]   So you can have two identical guns.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.440]   Say you have a Winchester 3030 lever action, a Model 1894, the classic that everybody knows.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:09.720]   The ones that were made in the first four years of production from 1894 to 1898 are
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:18.000]   already worth about 30% more than ones that were made just a year later, 1899 and later,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.240]   because under federal law, any gun or just its frame or receiver that was made in or
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:34.120]   before December 31st of 1898 is not considered a firearm, it's considered an antique.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:41.240]   And as an antique, it is outside of federal jurisdiction, which means that, you know,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.400]   earlier I was talking about the paperwork you have to fill out when you buy a modern
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   gun.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.840]   Well, if you buy an antique gun, there's absolutely no paperwork, it's outside of federal jurisdiction,
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.780]   there's no federal nexus.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.320]   That gun can go across state lines legally without going through a federally licensed
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.160]   dealer with no paper trail.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:06.840]   And a lot of astute firearms collectors know that and they are actively looking for cartridge
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.080]   guns that were made in or before 1898.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.320]   In the FAQ piece that I wrote, again, it's available free at my website, survivalblog.com.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:26.220]   In the left hand bar, click on the link that's marked FAQ, or FAQS.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:33.060]   And if you open up the FAQ file that I have on pre-1899 guns, it describes in detail the
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:39.680]   legalities, and I also have some very extensive lists of the serial number breaks.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:45.040]   Say you're at a gun show, you see a really old Winchester and you're wondering, "Could
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.440]   this be one of those ones that was made in 1898 or earlier?"
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.360]   If you have a printout of that FAQ article that I wrote, I have the serial number breaks
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:41:02.400]   that will show you that if, with a particular serial number, for a particular make and model
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:08.320]   of gun, what the break is for pre-1899 versus post-1899.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.520]   It's a pretty valuable reference, and again, I make it available free at my website.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.960]   The guns, the antique guns that I recommend buying are the ones from the 1890s that shoot
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.200]   modern cartridges.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.960]   They're not muzzle loaders, these are repeating cartridge guns, usually lever action, pump
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.040]   action, or bolt action.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.840]   Again, they're completely outside of federal jurisdiction, but they will shoot a deer just
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.200]   as dead as a modern gun at the same range.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.280]   In fact, you can legally sporterize one of these guns and put a modern scope on it, and
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.920]   even put it in a modern Kevlar graphite stock if you want to.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.520]   They're perfectly capable guns, but if you buy ones in the right serial number ranges,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:57.120]   they'll be made before 1899, and they'll be chambered in a cartridge that's still factory
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   made.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.360]   The ones that I recommend are things like the Swedish Mausers that are chambered in
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.680]   6.5x55 Swedish Mauser.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:11.320]   They're dated right on the receiver ring, 1898, 1896, whatever, right on the receiver
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.120]   ring, so there's absolutely no doubt when those guns were made.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.240]   I recommend Mauser bolt actions that were made in or before 1898, Smith & Wesson top
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:29.360]   break revolvers, particularly 38s and 4440s that were made in or before 1898, and also
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.000]   Winchester Model 1897 pump action shotguns that were made in the first two years of production.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.080]   There's only about, I think there were about what, 35,000 made, but you can still find
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.920]   them at gun shows if you look around, or you can find them of course just by the mail order.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:54.360]   If you search at gunbroker.com or gunsamerica.com, they usually, in fact they even have a separate
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.480]   section just for pre-1899 guns.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:03.560]   If you want to invest in a couple of antiques, especially if you're politically paranoid
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:10.320]   and you think that we may ever have a nationwide gun registration, that would be a really good
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:17.800]   category of guns to invest in, because right now, pre-1899 guns sell for about a 30% premium
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:25.400]   over an absolutely identical model, identical condition gun that was made in 1899 or later.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.520]   I think in the long run, they'll be at as much as a 100% or 200% premium on those guns
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.200]   if we ever have nationwide gun registration, because it'll only be those guns that are
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.600]   outside of federal jurisdiction and exempt from registration.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:48.400]   But couldn't the new, if we did, let's say, okay, we're going to have a national gun registration
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:57.160]   system, couldn't that law and that legislation simply include pre-1899 firearms as well?
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:06.320]   But that 1898 threshold hasn't changed since 1968, so the pool of guns out there, the available
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.880]   supply of pre-1899 guns is actually gradually shrinking.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:19.120]   In the eyes of the typical DC beltway politician, they really consider them a non-issue.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.440]   Unless one was ever used in a really high profile event, and here we're talking Lee
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.400]   Harvey Oswald or something like that, unless one was horribly misused, I don't think they're
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   ever going to get around to including those in any federal laws.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:44.680]   And in the eyes of the courts, it's a really, really long stretch to come before the Supreme
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:51.920]   Court and say, "Oh, Mr. Supreme Court Justices, these guns that were made in 1898 or earlier
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.200]   are still engaged, are still part of interstate commerce.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:04.040]   These guns have been out of interstate commerce for 117 years, so you really can't claim federal
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   jurisdiction."
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.160]   I don't think the courts would hold that up if they ever tried to bring them into federal
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.560]   jurisdiction at this point.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:18.400]   Again, that very arbitrary 1898 cutoff date has been set in stone since the passage of
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   the Gun Control Act of 1968.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:25.600]   Technically, they really should have just defined "antique" as a gun that is 100
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:31.680]   years old or older, and then that threshold would have rolled forward one year each December
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.920]   31st.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:39.080]   But instead, they arbitrarily locked it in as December 31st, 1898, and it's been frozen
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.680]   there ever since 1968.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.200]   So I think, again, in the eyes of the politician, they consider them a non-issue, and I think
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:55.000]   that exemption will continue at least for our generation or maybe even future generations.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.720]   What are some of the other interesting little value wrinkles in the gun marketplace, little
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:05.200]   corners of the market where you get an unexpected premium based upon certain characteristics?
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:12.080]   Well, the rarity of a particular gun is, of course, the main driving factor.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.960]   One of the guns that I've liked to collect over the years were the semi-auto battle rifles
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:22.760]   made by a Finnish company called Valmet, V-A-L-M-E-T.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   They have been out of the firearms business since about the year 2000, and there have
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   been none imported into the United States in military configuration since about 1992.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   So the supply of those guns is fixed.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.120]   There are new collectors coming out of the market constantly.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:49.920]   Ten years ago, I was buying Valmets for around $2,000 a piece.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.720]   Right now, they're between $4,000 and $6,000 a piece, and the sky's the limit because,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.400]   again, they've frozen the supply.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   And in fact, the tooling for the Valmet rifles actually was destroyed after a corporate merger.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:14.360]   The same corporation that Valmet became also acquired HK, Heckler & Koch, from Germany,
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.000]   which is also a very well-known battle rifle maker.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.480]   And apparently, the executives at HK did not like the idea of having competition within
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   their own company, and they asked the corporate management to destroy the tooling for the
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.800]   Valmet firearms.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:35.560]   So there will be no more Valmets ever made, unless they somehow magically recreate the
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.180]   tooling.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.980]   So I think that Valmets are one particularly good for the really high-end collector who
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:49.440]   already has a pretty complete battery of firearms, and they're looking to diversify.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:56.000]   I would say either Valmets or another good category would be the accidental import FN
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   FALs.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.160]   An FN is a .308 battle rifle.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.800]   It's a big, long, black rifle with a 20-round magazine.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.340]   The early ones were brought in by Browning Arms, and there were several other importers
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.940]   since then.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.580]   They're no longer imported.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:20.040]   There are some domestically made FALs, but the supply of original Belgian-European-made
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.760]   FALs is essentially frozen as well.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.280]   And the early, early ones are what's called a G-series FAL.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.920]   Those were considered an accidental import, because if they were imported now, they would
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:37.400]   be legally considered a machine gun, because they have a cut in the lower receiver for
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.520]   an auto sear, and they wouldn't be importable in that configuration now.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.520]   You don't have to register them as a machine gun, but everybody knows that they're a gun
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.480]   that would be easy to convert to full auto, and people are willing to pay a premium for
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.480]   them for that reason.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.280]   Again, that's called a G-series FAL.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Tim, the reason I broached this topic on radical personal finance is I teach people to invest
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.440]   in what they know.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.720]   I think as a background of a financial advisor, professional financial advisor, I think that
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:19.640]   we as financial advisors do the public a disservice, wherein we primarily shuttle people directly
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:24.920]   into mutual funds, and that's the extent of our investment knowledge.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:31.120]   But as I've interacted with lots of rich people, what I've found is that many people have insider
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.680]   knowledge on a specific marketplace, and they've been able to exploit that marketplace for
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.000]   their own financial gain.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.200]   Now, for some people, this is local single-family houses.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.760]   For other people, it's large ranches.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.320]   For some people, it's guns.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.560]   For other people, it's Porsches.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.440]   For some people, it's collectible coins.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.480]   For other people, it's Barbie dolls.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:59.160]   Describe for me your development as a firearms investor, and tell us how this has impacted
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.600]   your financial life.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   Sure.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.360]   Well, I was born in 1960.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.440]   I started collecting guns as a teenager.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:14.640]   Immediately after turning 21, I got a federal firearms license while I was still in college,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.520]   and I guess in retrospect, I can safely say that I sold quite a few guns out of my dorm
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.240]   room with my federal firearms license, even though it was against the campus policy.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   I started attending gun shows about 1980, and have been attending gun shows pretty regularly
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   ever since.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.640]   So I'm a pretty savvy collector.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.160]   I've developed a lot of knowledge, but what I would recommend for your listeners is that
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:50.760]   they pick a particular area in the firearms market to study up on.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:59.040]   If you get smart and you master the knowledge of a particular maker or even just a particular
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:07.080]   maker and a particular model of firearm, and then you attend gun shows, you can walk through
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   a gun show.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.920]   In fact, you could scan a gun show very quickly just looking for that particular model gun
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   based on its outline.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:21.160]   You can walk through a gun show, hit all the aisles of a gun show in the first 20 minutes
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.600]   after a gun show opens, and then jot down the table locations or memorize the table
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   locations to go back and talk to those dealers.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:37.120]   Based on your knowledge of that particular model and paying very close attention to things
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.560]   like bore condition, you want to carry a bore inspection light with you.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.880]   It's a fiber optic light that you shine up a firearms bore so you can closely inspect
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   the condition of the bore, which is one of the crucial factors of firearms condition.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:58.840]   But based on your knowledge of that particular model, you can literally buy a gun at one
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:05.000]   side of a gun show from an elderly collector who's getting rid of a collection and doesn't
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.340]   realize what something is now worth.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.080]   You buy that gun, you walk it over to the other side of the show where you see a dealer
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:23.600]   who has a similar assortment of guns, and based on your market knowledge, turn around
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   and resale that gun at wholesale and still make a 20% profit.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.960]   The same kind of thing goes on in the coin market all the time with ungraded coins.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.320]   But there it's an even more arcane knowledge based on the Sheldon scale of coin grading.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.800]   I don't want to go into that, but I'm sure you've had other guests who have described
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   that.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.520]   It's a pretty arcane body of knowledge, but if you can master that knowledge, have that
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:57.480]   between your ears, that is very valuable knowledge.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.360]   I would recommend that, say if someone has an interest in Colt single action revolvers,
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:12.320]   or Winchester lever action rifles, or Colt AR-15s, or M1 carbines, or whatever.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.080]   Whatever guns interest you, do the research.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.880]   Nowadays you don't even have to go through back issues of magazines to develop that body
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   of knowledge.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:27.280]   All the knowledge you need is available on the internet, just with a lot of web searches
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.320]   and detailed reading.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:37.640]   If you can get smart about that particular type of gun, you can turn that to your advantage
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:44.320]   and you can make a handsome profit even in a market that's stagnant.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360]   In a rising market, you can make a tremendous amount of money.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:54.520]   I have a lot of buddies who have very nicely filled safes and they affectionately refer
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.800]   to them as their retirement plan.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.560]   I always doubted the authority of that statement simply because it's a rare gun collector that
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.400]   I've met who keeps detailed records.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.120]   I've never had a great deal of insight as to the actual appreciation and the value of
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   the gun market.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Two part question.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:19.400]   One, what's been the long term rate of return of firearms if we were just to pretend it's
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   an asset class?
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.880]   Two, do you have any sense whether you have detailed records or just a general sense,
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.560]   do you have any sense of your own personal investment rate of return of your investing
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.680]   activities with regard to firearms?
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   Sure.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:41.160]   I think we can safely say that guns as a whole have matched inflation.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:51.800]   High grade guns and guns with particular collector appeal have far surpassed the rate of inflation.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:55:00.680]   They haven't kept up with the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P in terms of decade in,
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.760]   decade out.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:09.280]   But it's still as an asset class a very good investment.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:17.120]   You're hardly ever going to lose money unless you do stupid things like store your firearms
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:22.600]   improperly, say you live in a humid climate and you don't oil your firearms and you don't
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.440]   leave them in a climate controlled gun vault.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.040]   You want to invest in what's called a golden rod.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.240]   It's an electric dehumidifier that sits in the bottom of your gun vault.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:40.160]   As long as you don't store your guns improperly, you're basically never going to lose money
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.160]   on guns.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:48.000]   And if you buy the right guns, you have the potential to make a very handsome profit.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I think my own rate of return has been above average because I've gone pretty heavily into
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:01.280]   what are commonly called black rifles which are essentially paramilitary semi-automatic
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   firearms.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:08.100]   They're guns that basically look like modern battle rifles but they're not capable of fully
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.100]   automatic fire.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.640]   They're only semi-automatic.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:19.200]   And by buying guns from makers like FN, from Valmet, from IWI, they're the makers of the
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.760]   Tavor in Israel.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:23.320]   Well, actually, they're assembled here in the States.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.860]   The parts come from Israel.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:34.000]   By buying particular models, my rate of return has probably averaged around 12 to 15% per
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.560]   year.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   And I've always been the type that's constantly improving my collection.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:49.080]   And although my collection has gotten considerably larger in recent years, I've mainly just been
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.720]   upgrading my collection with each trade that I make.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:57:00.360]   And by doing so, the net worth that I have in those gun vaults, and I use that term in
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:05.780]   the plural, I have several, has gone up substantially.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:13.440]   What I love about your guess or estimate of 12 to 15% rate of return is it demonstrates
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.640]   a practical way to approach preparedness.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:23.720]   One of the dangers that I observe of people who become concerned about catastrophic events,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:31.940]   whether it be economic collapse or various other events which could lead to global unrest
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:37.240]   and the end of the world as we know it, as it's affectionately called in prepper circles,
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:43.120]   it's easy to perhaps go overboard and only assume catastrophe.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:50.760]   And if your plans only assume a catastrophe or collapse of some sort, then perhaps you
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.600]   might not be able to enjoy the benefit of just the good life if things continue just
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.040]   about as they have for the last few decades.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:04.600]   And so if you've been able to achieve a nice financial return, not only do you have a well-armored
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:10.760]   household which has tremendous benefit if there is some sort of scenarios which involve
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.900]   the end of the world as we know it, but if that doesn't occur, then you've achieved a
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.720]   nice investment rate of return and you've had an enjoyable hobby.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.080]   It gives you something to do with your children, you get to go to gun shows, and that's something
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.000]   that I would assume you enjoy.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.720]   So it's a good illustration of managing both sides of the risk.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.160]   Yes, and I think that is a very well-reasoned approach.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   And I do recommend that people don't go overboard.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.980]   I often see with preppers, in particular, people who come from the medical profession
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:43.900]   tend to weigh overdue on medical preps.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:50.620]   And people who come from a firefighting background tend to weigh overdue on firefighting.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:59.740]   And people who are gun hobbyists tend to actually overdo on firearms themselves even to the
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.740]   detriment of not being able to provide enough food storage for their family.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:08.020]   So I believe in well-balanced preparations.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:15.380]   And if you buy quality tools, and I consider guns to be nothing more than a tool.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:22.140]   There's nothing magical about guns, although they do have a certain cachet.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   It's a tool.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:28.220]   And if you buy a quality tool, it's something that will last not just your own lifetime
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.540]   but into the lifetime of your grandchildren.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:37.020]   Right now, I'm in the process of diversifying my own collection and pushing into stainless
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.660]   steel bolt-action rifles.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:48.220]   In part as a hedge in the event that we end up with a future ban on semi-automatic rifles.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:55.620]   I'm hedging pretty heavily right now into modern black-stocked stainless steel rifles
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:59.540]   made by Ruger, Winchester, and Remington.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:05.340]   And I don't think I can go too far wrong with that because that's going to at least match
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:10.260]   the rate of inflation and because they're stainless steel, they're guns that are literally
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.540]   last four or five generations, maybe 10 generations.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:20.260]   You know, right now, it's a rarity to find a firearm with a nice bore that's 300 years
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:25.060]   old, especially because black powder was used in those days.
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:35.540]   But just the age of the steel and given the vagaries of maintenance by various family
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:40.460]   members, someone occasionally is going to leave a gun wet after firing it and it's going
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.980]   to end up with a rusty bore and then that means it's going to have a pitted bore.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.260]   But if you're starting out with stainless steel firearms, it's kind of hard to mess
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.620]   up.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:52.740]   So I'm actually pushing in that direction quite a bit.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:57.820]   And one of the other reasons I'm pushing towards stainless steel firearms right now is because
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.980]   there are now a number of exotic coatings available.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:08.580]   One is called Cerakote, it's C-E-R-A-K-O-T-E, that are available to go over the top of stainless
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.580]   steel.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:12.780]   If you don't like the reflective surface of stainless steel, you can just simply have
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.420]   it Cerakoted.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:21.740]   There's also a dazzling number of camouflage patterns that are available to be applied
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:28.500]   to any gun, including stainless steel guns, through what's called a hydro dipping process.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:34.380]   It's essentially like a decal that goes over the top of the finish of the gun.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.780]   They dip the rifle in a bath and it looks almost like magic when they come up there
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:43.700]   and camouflage coated from end to end.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:51.020]   And that finish can be peeled off and removed at a later date if need be.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:56.740]   But that provides a wonderfully protective finish for the gun and it will, of course,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:03.420]   if you can get a nice subdued color or a camouflage pattern, it will cover up the shiny reflective
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.820]   surface of stainless steel.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.380]   So I think with those finishes now available, stainless steel rifles are definitely the
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.380]   way to go.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.460]   Jim, you're a big advocate of not only purchasing the firearms themselves, but also purchasing
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.620]   the appropriate accessories, replacement parts, magazines, etc.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.780]   And I remember when I bought my first Glock, I went out and I didn't just stick with what
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.380]   did they come with, three magazines, I believe.
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.180]   I didn't just stick with the three that came with it.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.980]   I went out and purchased more.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:35.140]   And in retrospect, I wish I'd purchased more of the 33 round magazines when they were more
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.140]   widely available.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:42.700]   How do you balance that access there, especially from a financial perspective?
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.300]   I understand from a prepper's perspective, you want to have lots of magazines in case
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.060]   you need to use the firearms for a defensive purpose.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:57.020]   But from an investment perspective, how do you balance choosing to buy more firearms
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.580]   or choosing to buy more accessories?
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:03.180]   Because I think a strong case could be made, especially if one is predicting the end of
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.900]   the world as we know it, a strong case could be made that it's actually the magazines and
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:11.660]   the accessories which could be more valuable than the firearm itself.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.660]   Right.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.140]   For barter purposes, there would be nothing like having a shoebox full of Glock magazines
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:22.020]   of various calibers and capacities in a disaster situation.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.340]   There may come a day where people will just scoff at the idea of trading you silver or
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.100]   gold coins for food.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:33.820]   But boy, they will certainly be lining up to buy Glock magazines.
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:45.460]   And you're only 30, so you don't probably remember the gun ban of 1994 to 2004 very well.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:54.260]   But during that 10-year period, a Glock magazine went from $19 a piece to $80 a piece by the
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.180]   time the ban ended.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:01.060]   Thankfully, that ban had a 10-year sunset clause and it was canceled out at the end
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.060]   of 10 years.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.020]   Otherwise, we'd still be stuck with it.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:09.300]   And if we were, Glock magazines would probably be going for $200 or $300 a piece right now,
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.580]   just for a standard 13-round or 15-round Glock magazine.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:16.340]   And we're talking about a piece of plastic here.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:23.980]   When governments get involved and they artificially influence the free market, all manner of chaos
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.540]   results.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:32.540]   And with things like firearms magazines, that's an area where politicians could get involved,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:39.340]   where prices could go radically higher, and where even a small investment could reap a
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:47.940]   reward of anywhere from 100% to as much as 2,000% if a ban goes into effect, especially
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.180]   if it's a ban without a sunset clause.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:55.940]   You are also an advocate of accumulating appropriate amounts of ammunition.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.140]   I want to ask you about something.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.180]   I've just always wanted to ask you this.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.340]   You've been an advocate in the past of buying lots of .22 long rifle ammunition.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:10.420]   You affectionately refer to it as ballistic wampum, and in your novels, you talk about
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.900]   it being used as a point of barter.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.660]   I never bought that theory of yours.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.820]   I thought, "Okay, that's very cute.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.660]   Jim has this nice little turn of phrase.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:23.820]   It's very nice," until, what was it, a few years ago.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:28.860]   And you went to buy boxes of .22 long rifle, and even .22 long rifle was unavailable.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860]   So talk about—
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860]   Jim Collison: Right.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860]   It's so hard to find.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:37.940]   Steve: Yeah, so talk about the same market in ammunition and my kind of part-beeb, selfish
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   question.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.540]   Is there any historical evidence for your affection for .22 long rifle, or is that just
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   something that you—
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.700]   Jim Collison: No, it's just simply because it's ubiquitous.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:54.020]   It's used by so many different rifles and pistols, and it's a very common caliber.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:06:01.260]   .22 long rifle and, to a lesser extent, .22 magnum are very widely used.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.860]   And because there's such a huge installed base, as it were, there's always going to
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.740]   be a demand for that ammunition.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:12.780]   And from a barter standpoint, I can't think of anything better in a disaster with which
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.260]   to be able to barter, because not only is it very durable—if you keep ammunition in
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.660]   a sealed can, it'll last for generations—but one of the other key attributes of any good
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:30.180]   barter item is that it's divisible, what they refer to as a fungible asset.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:36.660]   And the divisibility of .22 long rifle in particular is tremendous, because it comes
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:43.740]   50 or 100 or in a bulk pack as much as 800 rounds per box.
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:53.140]   That's potentially—a box of 50 .22 cartridges is potentially 50 separate barter transactions
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.220]   for small items of food, for example.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:01.380]   You might be able to trade three or four .22 cartridges for a can of beans in a real disaster.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.980]   So it really does make an ideal barter currency.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.820]   I stocked up on it pretty heavily, and it was just kind of my dumb luck that I happened
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:15.680]   to notice a sale about, what was it, six or seven years ago.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:21.720]   There was a big sale from Sportsman's Guide, which is one of the large mail order catalogs.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.020]   And apparently they'd had trouble selling some bulk-packed ammunition made by the Federal
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.260]   Cartridge Company.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:36.460]   For years, Federal Cartridge Company had a bulk pack of 550 rounds of .22 long rifle
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.180]   ammo.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:44.700]   And about six or seven years ago, they switched to a 350-round bulk pack, and they didn't
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.460]   sell as well, because people felt somehow they were getting cheated, even though the
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:53.540]   per-cartridge cost was about the same, because they'd changed the quantity of the bulk
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.500]   pack.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:08:04.080]   So those bulk packs of 350 rounds went on sale by mail order by Sportsman's Guide
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.340]   for $16 for a bulk pack of 350 cartridges.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   Whoa.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:16.260]   I saw that as a bargain, because they had been selling the 550-round bulk packs for
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.020]   around $16.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.180]   So I thought, "Well, I'm getting a lot here."
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:27.300]   So a buddy of mine and I split a large order, and between the two of us, I think we gave
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.740]   the UPS driver back strain.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:39.700]   We bought, I believe it was somewhere around 30,000 rounds of .22 long rifle at that price.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:47.060]   Only a year later, the crisis that you described came up, where a shortage of ammunition started
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.220]   with the battle rifle cartridges, but then just kind of as an after effect, people thought,
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.980]   "Oh, I should buy some .22 as well."
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.260]   Well, did they ever.
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:01.940]   And you still can't reliably find .22 long rifle cartridges.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:09.340]   And those same bulk packs of .22 cartridges, again, they were 350 rounds per box, they
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:16.980]   were made by Federal Cartridge Company, now sell for between $50 and $70 per carton, per
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.100]   bulk pack.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:26.580]   And I can't think of any other investment that I've made that's had near the same level
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:35.460]   of return on investment as that particular bulk purchase of .22 long rifle ammo.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.100]   It turned out to be just kind of serendipity, but boy, I'm not regretting it at all.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.420]   So as an investor, have you sold most of it to reap your profit?
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:49.260]   Actually, I've sold back into the market about half of it, and I've done quite well with
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.660]   it.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.620]   But what I'm replacing it with is actually battle rifle ammunition.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:10:01.700]   I'm now buying .223 and .308 ammo in quantity with the proceeds from that in anticipation
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:07.300]   of a new shortage in the future of those battle rifle cartridges.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:12.580]   It's meant that I've had to buy a lot more ammo cans because that ammo is not quite as
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.060]   compact as .22 long rifle per cartridge.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:22.700]   But I think that in the long run, that strategy should pay off well for me.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.260]   What would be your advice?
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:30.300]   Pretend there's a listener who is just listening to this show out of interest, and most of
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:34.660]   the world does not have – here in the United States, a lot of us have lots of guns.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.420]   But much of the world doesn't have – firearm ownership is not nearly as widespread as it
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:45.940]   is, and there are still many people in the United States who don't own any firearms.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:54.940]   What would be your advice as far as a reasonable and thoughtful, rational way for a neophyte
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:01.300]   firearms buyer to approach building up their own collection?
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.020]   Well, it all depends on whether or not you're survival-minded.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:10.340]   If you anticipate a socioeconomic collapse, then you would need a battery of firearms
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:15.900]   that would be appropriate to defend a family and to put food on the table of a family through
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.780]   hunting and through slaughtering your own livestock.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:27.140]   And there I would recommend that you have one battle rifle for each adult member of
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:36.300]   the family, one modern combat high-capacity pistol in a man-stopping caliber, so that
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:42.460]   would be at least a 9mm, preferably a 40 Smith & Wesson or a 45 automatic for each adult
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:50.260]   member of the family, and then one .22 rifle for each member of the family, adults and
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:56.460]   children, and my favorite right now for that is the Ruger 10/22 stainless steel takedown.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:02.780]   It's one that can be disassembled into two pieces so it'll fit in a backpack.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:10.540]   And then one shotgun that could double as both a combat shotgun and as a bird hunting
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:19.700]   shotgun for each adult member of the family, and perhaps one long-range counter-sniper
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.700]   rifle.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:28.820]   Here I'm talking about a scoped bolt-action rifle chambered in .308 or .30-06 preferably
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:35.900]   that would be capable of taking down a man-sized target out to 1,200 yards.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.900]   You should have one of those at least for the family, preferably one for each adult
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.580]   member of the family.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:51.380]   Now if your main concern is just investing and you're not anticipating any kind of societal
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:57.780]   disruption, then perhaps you're better off investing all in pre-1899 firearms because
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:04.140]   they're the, like for example Colts, a Colt single-action revolver that you would have
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:13.860]   paid $30 or $40 for in the 1960s is now selling for $6,000, $7,000, $8,000.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:21.180]   It's just a matter of finding a make and model of gun that's of very high quality, that's
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:27.460]   sought after by collectors, and that's going to appreciate in value.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.180]   What about, final couple of questions and we're done.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:38.180]   Obviously with firearms, many of my listeners will be in living situations that make it
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:46.140]   perhaps more difficult to accumulate a collection, whether it's simply trundling ammo cans filled
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:51.700]   with ammunition up to the 30th floor of an apartment, that can be a little bit taxing,
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:59.340]   or simply coming and going with long rifle cases every day in many of our neighborhoods
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.860]   can raise some eyebrows.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.580]   Do you have any advice for people who are concerned about theft?
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:09.380]   Certainly I would say, I would lean toward collecting handguns, but there's a lot to
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:12.260]   be said for using musical instrument cases.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:21.460]   My favorites are guitar cases and trombone cases, or for example I just mentioned takedown
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.620]   rifles.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:30.300]   You can fit a takedown .22 or a takedown combat shotgun or riot shotgun in a trumpet
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:40.060]   case and to the untrained eye, unless you're wearing an NRA hat and carrying it around,
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.460]   it's just going to look like you're a musician.
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.760]   You might want to lean more toward handguns if you're an urbanite and you're looking to
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.620]   invest in guns and you're worried about the high profile of carrying gun cases around.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:03.580]   Musical instrument cases or Casio keyboard cases for example can cover all manner of
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.580]   investments.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.280]   I won't say sins, I'll say investments.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.380]   Why is gun collecting so addictive?
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:17.740]   I think part of it is the historical attachment that comes along with a lot of firearms.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:25.220]   When you pick up a Winchester rifle that has brass tacks pounded into it by some Native
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:31.780]   American from the 1850s and 1860s, you're literally holding a piece of history in your
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.400]   hands.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.160]   I often hear the phrase at gun shows, "If this gun could only speak about where it was."
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.820]   The same applies to military guns.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:47.060]   You say you have a Model 98 Mauser that was made in 1917.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:52.740]   Most of that gun probably was in the trenches of World War I or you say you have an M1 Garand
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:59.260]   that is in a serial number that dates it before 1945.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:05.660]   Chances are probably 99% that gun was actually carried by a combat infantryman in World War
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:11.340]   II in either the European or the Pacific theater of operations.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:18.340]   So you're literally investing in history and everyone really knows that when they see these
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.300]   particular makes and models of guns in particular serial number ranges.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.580]   For example, there's a whole bunch of people who collect nothing but trapdoor Springfield
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:33.380]   carbines in what was called the Custer era.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:39.180]   This is a single shot 45-70 carbine that was carried by cavalrymen and if you buy them
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:49.940]   in a particular serial number range, you're buying them before the Battle of Little Bighorn
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:53.660]   in 1876.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:17:02.900]   You're literally buying a gun that could have been carried by a cavalry trooper in the Custer
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.900]   era.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:12.500]   So for guns like that, there's a particular significance that's historical and I see the
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:21.340]   same thing go on with Japanese swords where just by seeing a particular maker's mark on
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:29.820]   the tang of a Japanese sword, you know that it's from the whatever era from like 1600
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:37.060]   or whatever and it could have been carried in whatever Japanese Civil War.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:45.340]   Those kind of things are going to be known by astute collectors and they will always
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:53.620]   put not just a premium but a multiplier on the value of that particular item versus one
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:57.460]   that's just as well made but in a different serial number range.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.380]   Aaron Ross Powell: Jim, this has been awesome.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:06.340]   Survivalblog.com is your website, probably if not the largest, one of the largest survival
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.820]   oriented websites.

[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.460]   My latest novel is called Land of Promise.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:21.740]   It's about the establishment of a libertarian Christian homeland nation following the establishment
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.780]   of a global Islamic caliphate.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.780]   It's set in the future.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.700]   I hope your listeners enjoy reading it.
