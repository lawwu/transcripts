[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.820]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.540]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.440]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.520]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.280]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.560]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.000]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.340]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   you will find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.560]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.660]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.400]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you to this episode.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.740]   We are gonna talk about character study.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.520]   And that sounds like a kind of a dry thing,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.660]   but something that we as parents are very interested in.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.360]   But we're gonna talk about character study
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.160]   from a different perspective,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.960]   maybe than you've ever considered before.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.400]   We're gonna marry that
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.320]   with a discussion of great literature.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   And why is it important to read books as a family
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.400]   and to discuss books with your children?
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.320]   And what can you do when you're talking about books,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.200]   besides just say, what was the story about
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.540]   and what happened in the story
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.440]   and what did you learn at the end?
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   Some of the best conversations come
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   when you dive into the characters that you love
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.720]   or the characters that you hate in a book
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   and try to pick apart what you can learn about yourself,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.080]   about human nature and about making better decisions
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.640]   by reading books together.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.120]   And I have a really great guest
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   who loves to think about all of those things
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.160]   and has been thinking about them for a long time.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.720]   I have with me today, Stephanie Meter,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.480]   who is the Curriculum Developer
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.880]   for the Exposition Strand
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480]   here at Classical Conversations Multimedia.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   Stephanie, welcome and thanks for coming.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.400]   - Thank you, I'm excited to talk about this.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   - You always like to talk about books, I know.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.680]   I can always count on you to have a good perspective
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.020]   and a really good story.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.320]   So I'm excited for our listeners to hear from you today.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.600]   I want you to tell me, you might have to go back,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.720]   not as far back as some of us would have to go,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   but who is the first character
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.980]   you remember meeting in a book?
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.420]   - So I don't know.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.680]   (laughing)
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.920]   - You have been reading books for a really long time, I know.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.960]   - Yes, and I don't really remember not knowing characters
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.880]   because books were such a part of just, you know,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   my infancy on all the way up.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   I can say that I remember Betsy in the Betsy Tacey series.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   - Yes.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.760]   - And Laura from "Little House on the Prairie"
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.040]   were some of my really early characters.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.380]   And then a little bit older,
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.120]   I was maybe like in first or second grade
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240]   when we read "The Boxcar Children"
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.400]   and "Jessie and Violet" really stuck out to me.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.640]   So I don't know if I could give you a first character,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   you know, when I was three or four, but Betsy,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.800]   Betsy maybe was four or five.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.220]   - Yeah, maybe.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.660]   That is really cool.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.400]   So you met these characters,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.560]   you met the first characters that you remember
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.160]   when somebody else was reading to you, is that right?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.000]   - Yes.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.600]   - Yeah.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.560]   - And it's kind of funny,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.120]   I was having this thought as you were asking me
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.260]   about first characters,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.220]   that the characters that stuck out to me the most
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.160]   were girl characters,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.840]   which is interesting because in modern movies and books,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.300]   I don't tend to love the female characters as much,
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.800]   but that's never been a problem
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.480]   with older and classic literature.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.600]   And now I have to think about that
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.900]   because what is it about classic literature
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.280]   that maybe the characters are just better developed,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.000]   but I always like those female characters
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.560]   more than any of the modern female characters.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.540]   So that's kind of a tangent,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.380]   but you may be--
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.200]   - Isn't that interesting,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   but that may come back into play.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.360]   'Cause I think in a few minutes,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   I want you to talk about why great literature,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.800]   what is it that we learn from great literature?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.320]   So put a pin in that thought,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.120]   'cause I wanna come back to it.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   I love that Betsy from the Betsy Tacey books.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.600]   And listeners, if you haven't read this,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.320]   this is a series by Maude Hart,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.560]   H-A-R-T, Lovelace,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.320]   about a little girl named Betsy
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.680]   who is born around the turn of the century.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.520]   And I mean the 1900s.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.200]   So she's born in the early 1900s.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.160]   And this series takes her from when she is
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   a really little girl all the way up through her marriage.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.120]   And so you can grow up with Betsy.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   I myself remember meeting Betsy and Tacey
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.760]   at the church library when I was a little girl.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.600]   Okay, so what did you think about these characters?
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.720]   What did you think about Betsy
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.980]   and about Laura from Little House on the Prairie?
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.400]   - I liked them.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.160]   I liked finding pieces of myself in them.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600]   I think especially when you're little,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.440]   you resonate with characters
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.240]   that remind you a little bit of yourself
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.560]   because you're forming your own identity.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.640]   And so when you see that reflection,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.880]   it gives you something to look at
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.240]   and then to aspire to or to use as lessons.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.160]   If you are similar to a character
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.080]   and that character makes some bad choices,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.600]   you can think, "Oh yeah, I would have done that as well."
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.240]   - Yes.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   - So I liked these characters
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.800]   because they reminded me a little bit of me, I think.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.040]   And then they were also often a little bit
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   better than me in ways that I just was noticing.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.840]   I think about, especially Laura
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.040]   from Little House on the Prairie,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.400]   just the daily tasks that they were asked to do
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.320]   and to participate in their lives.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.840]   I felt she had a really important role in her family
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.040]   and that was something that I could aspire to
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.040]   of doing chores or activities
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.080]   that actually helped her family survive.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.840]   I thought that was really cool.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   The same thing really with Jessie and Violet
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.960]   from the Boxcar Children,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.240]   because in that first book, the kids are on their own.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.920]   And so they have to figure out how to get food
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.080]   and cook food and schedule their lives
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   and get enough sunshine and exercise.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.280]   - Right.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   - Those were things that were inspiring to me.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.000]   So finding characters that reminded me of me
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.760]   but that were a little bit better
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   so that I could have something to reach toward.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.920]   - I like that, I like that.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.720]   I can remember,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   and I'm just gonna go ahead and say this
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.200]   because probably in some of the stories that we'll tell,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.000]   it's gonna come out or either be awkward.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.760]   Stephanie and I are related.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.040]   I'm actually Stephanie's mom.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.800]   And so I remember what she was like
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.600]   from my perspective anyway,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.720]   when she was being introduced to some of these characters.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.320]   So what I was gonna say, Stephanie,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   is that I can remember when you read the Boxcar Children
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.760]   that for months, if not years after that,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.400]   you and Sarah played Boxcar Kids.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.640]   You played that with everybody who came to the house
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.360]   and you played what would it be like
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.240]   if we lived by ourselves?
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.560]   How would we make it?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.040]   - Yes, I mean, the pine straw beds,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.160]   we had pine trees in our yard.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.040]   So the Boxcar Children made their beds of pine straw.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.160]   And I mean, that was a staple in our games for years.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.000]   - Yes.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.840]   I think, I found it interesting
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   that you learned how to do things from reading.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   I remember when you came in and asked for aluminum foil
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.960]   because you were making an oven
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.600]   with some bricks you had found in the woods.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.920]   And I remember thinking, how do you know these things?
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.000]   And so it was interesting to me,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   all the odd skills and odd bits of knowledge
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.280]   you seem to glean from the books that we read.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.920]   - Yeah, a lot of weird knowledge.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.680]   I can, well, I probably couldn't,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.640]   but I think I could have a chance at preserving ice
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.800]   using straw and shade thanks to Farmer Boys.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.440]   - It's so funny.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   I think it's beautiful the way that reading can give you
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.720]   scope for your imagination, as Anne Shirley would say.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.680]   But also practical knowledge
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.200]   that you might not just come upon
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.920]   in your everyday modern life.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.480]   So that's very cool.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.920]   So can you think of other memorable characters
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.480]   you've encountered in your reading?
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   And did you find yourself wanting to be like or not like?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.960]   Or maybe give us some characters you wanted to be like
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.560]   and why, and some characters you did not want to be like
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.480]   and why.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.000]   - Yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.560]   So interestingly, I think the characters that I wanted
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.720]   to be like stick out to me more than the characters
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.960]   I didn't want to be like.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.120]   I definitely have some in mind that I don't wanna be like,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.720]   but on the whole, I would say the characters that I did like
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.200]   and want to emulate stuck out to me more.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.640]   And thinking about this question,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.360]   what's occurring to me is that most of the characters
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.040]   that have stuck with me are either from books
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   that I read when I was very young,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.720]   or books that I got to study with a more fine tooth comb.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.760]   So either books that I read when I was like 14 years old
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.200]   or younger, or books that I read,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.920]   had to read slowly and talk about.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.680]   Those are the two categories that really stick with me.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.800]   Characters I wanted to be like,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.400]   I talked about that a little bit already,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.040]   but I also, funny that comes to mind is Beatrice
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.560]   from Beezus and Ramona.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.000]   - Oh, yes.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.320]   - And Beatrice is not even the main character.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.560]   She's like the sort of, she's the annoying older sister
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.840]   because she's so responsible.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   And I kind of wanted to be like that.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.200]   I thought she was really cool.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.320]   - Right, well, you were the older sister.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.480]   So you probably had some of those same tendencies,
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.280]   although I did not find you annoying,
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.000]   but I won't ask your sister if she found you annoying.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.240]   - Well, I think on the whole, I'm more of a Ramona,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.200]   but I kind of aspire to be (indistinct)
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.280]   - That's really good, I like that.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.360]   That in the books that we read with our children,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.200]   we can allow our children to find the people
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.920]   that they are like, and then the people
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.800]   that they maybe wish they were more like,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.240]   even if they are self-aware enough
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.800]   to know that they're not quite there yet.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.680]   - And then like older, I love Betsy and the Hiding Place.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   She's just sort of one
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.680]   of the ultimate aspirational characters.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.920]   I don't know how she managed to be both so good
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.280]   and so likable, because a lot of times characters
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.640]   that are really good to the nth degree are not likable.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.520]   They kind of, they remind us of all the things
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.600]   that we're bad at, and we find them annoying.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   But Betsy was not like that.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.520]   She's such an example of a Christian woman
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.920]   who is being Christ-like, but in a way that's endearing
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   instead of a turnoff.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.280]   So love her.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.200]   I also like Edward P. Dowd from Harvey.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   - Oh, yes.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.640]   - He has a line that has stuck with me since challenge one
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   that he says, he realized that he needed in his life
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   to be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.600]   And for years he was smart,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   but he thinks he prefers pleasant.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.280]   And that just has stuck with me the whole time.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.960]   Just, you can be smart, but being kind,
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.560]   and maybe kind is a better word for me than pleasant,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.720]   is a more enjoyable and effective way to be.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.600]   So he's stuck with me.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.880]   - Oh, that is lovely.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.040]   And that's one thing I wanna encourage you, parents.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.480]   Your children, you and your children
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.240]   are gonna happen upon these characters
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.000]   that are going to say or do something
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.360]   that might really change your thought patterns,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.720]   could change the trajectory of your life
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.000]   if you really take it to heart,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.320]   take some of those words to heart.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.240]   And that kinda leads me into the next thing
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.680]   I wanna ask you, Stephanie.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.840]   I know that you're the strand,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.040]   the exposition strand developer,
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.600]   and you're in charge of developing our curriculum
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.440]   with regards to reading and writing
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.120]   and shepherding our families as we learn about
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.320]   and learn from literature.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.240]   So here's a question.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.080]   Why do we read so much in the challenge years?
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.760]   We read a lot of books.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.960]   I can remember having students come back and say
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.640]   when they went to college that they talked to other peers
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.480]   who did not read a quarter of the books
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.600]   that they, the challenge students, had read.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.080]   Why do we read so much in challenge
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.040]   and what are we learning?
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.240]   - Yeah, well, the sheer volume is partly because
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.000]   there are so many great books out there.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.200]   I mean, we want to get a survey of some of the classics.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.040]   Reading a number of books also increases the chances,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.400]   I think, of students finding characters
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.040]   that are like them or that resonate with them
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.200]   and getting a wide variety of situations
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.080]   and questions answered and settings covered.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.520]   So just surveying a number of books
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.360]   is helpful for a lot of reasons.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.600]   And all of them can help you exercise
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.000]   your moral imagination,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.160]   which is something that we talk about a lot at CC,
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   just that idea of being able to think about
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.600]   tough decisions and tough situations
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.160]   and see what the character did
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   and imagine how that can apply to your life.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.800]   So that exercising the moral imagination
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.440]   is one of the things that we are learning
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   in all of these books,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   as well as learning how to read hard things.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.080]   Learning how to read things that are challenging
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.240]   either in the words or the content
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.520]   is a skill that you can apply for the rest of your life,
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.640]   whether you're continuing to read challenging things
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.680]   or just think about challenging things.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.960]   The way that your brain
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.840]   learns how to put thoughts together
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.960]   comes through what you're reading a lot of the time.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.600]   - I love that.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.640]   I really do love that.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.360]   And I love that we encourage our students
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   to come upon hard human struggles
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:39.920]   and human nature in all its shades.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.800]   We encourage our students to read all about
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.240]   all of those things,
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.920]   many of which are disquieting or even disturbing,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.720]   but we encourage those students to read those things
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.480]   while they are in the shelter of their family,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.440]   while their families are stewarding
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.360]   what they take from that.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.240]   And that's why it is so important
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   for families to read together and discuss together
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.560]   so that students don't carry necessarily
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   the burden of context and situations
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.240]   that are too hard for them or too heavy for them
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.000]   without help to process.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.080]   We have Challenge B students reading about the Holocaust.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.800]   That is a horrible thing,
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.280]   a horrible situation,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.400]   and the things that the Jews faced.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   And the situation itself is difficult.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.320]   And so to have students talk with their parents
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.480]   through that is very important, I think, Stephanie.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.000]   And it gives them kind of a safer space
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   to experience and process these things
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.560]   than having to encounter them head on in their actual lives.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.080]   - Yeah, I like that you brought up
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.400]   that a lot of the books that we read
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   help our students consider the questions of human struggle
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   and how their decisions have shaped them
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.680]   and how their circumstances have caused them
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   to react in certain ways
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.880]   and where they can find themselves
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.560]   and want to go that way,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.800]   and then where our students can find themselves
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.600]   and think, "I don't want to go that way."
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.520]   And being able to talk about that in the family
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.960]   is so very important.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.080]   I like that you say we are learning all of those things
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.000]   by reading a broad selection
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.120]   during the challengers of all kinds of things.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.640]   So we get a lot from reading books
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.880]   and we gain a lot from talking about books.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.720]   What can good literature teach us about writing?
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.480]   - Yeah, so thinking about that,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.360]   people who are excellent at any art,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.800]   so I mean, painting, dancing, sculpting, sports, writing,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.280]   first start by observing the masters who came before them
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.680]   and then imitating them
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.600]   and then eventually coming into their own.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.080]   So by reading and talking about great literature,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.960]   we can begin to identify the patterns
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.240]   and stylistic devices that great authors used
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.080]   and add those to our writing arsenal.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.760]   And so doing that, honestly, with study and practice,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.160]   I do think that most of us have the ability
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.920]   to become good writers.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.240]   - Oh, wow, I really did want to ask you that
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.280]   because so many parents that I've talked to
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.040]   through the years at practicums and at other events,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.240]   so many parents have said to me,
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.600]   "I don't know how I can help my child be a good writer
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.520]   "because I'm not a good writer.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.880]   "I was never a good writer.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.320]   "I'm not gonna be a good writer.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.280]   "I don't know how to help my child be a good writer."
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   So what you're saying is that we probably all can learn
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.520]   to be a good writer if we try
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.320]   and if we intentionally pick up
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.840]   on what these great masters were laying down
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   when they wrote these books.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.040]   - Yeah, I really do think that.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.480]   So, and I mean, obviously that doesn't mean
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.720]   that everybody is going to love writing
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.280]   or that writing will always become the thing
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.840]   that they're best at.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.720]   So just because everybody was created
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.640]   with different passions and strengths,
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.840]   writing isn't going to be it for every human.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.600]   But I think a good writer,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.640]   somebody who expresses themselves clearly and accurately
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.040]   and is able to keep a reader's attention,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   I do absolutely think that everybody
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.200]   has the capability of that.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.920]   - That is great.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.400]   What do you think you learned?
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   'Cause you were read to pretty much constantly
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   as a child until you could read to yourself.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.600]   And then you read pretty much constantly
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.200]   since you've learned to read.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.280]   What did you, do you remember
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.840]   what you learned from reading?
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   - I think a lot of what I learned was unconscious almost.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.000]   So I am a writer
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.280]   and I aspire to be a novel writer one day.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.880]   And I can notice that the quality of my writing
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.320]   is directly related to what I'm reading in my spare time,
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.040]   which is really interesting and kind of,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.400]   I don't know, humbling.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.240]   It's weird.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.400]   My writing quality definitely goes up
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.720]   when I read good books.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.400]   But the things that I learned from reading,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   I mean, I got a good grasp of basic things like grammar,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.240]   I guess.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.520]   But what's sort of interesting to me
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.200]   is that I think I got a good understanding
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.240]   of the shape of a story.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.360]   - Ooh, yes.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   - The pacing and the elements that make up a good story,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.120]   I internalized just because I was reading
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.880]   so many good stories.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.800]   And I drafted the first draft of the novel
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.960]   that I hope to one day publish when I was 12.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.760]   And I still go back to it.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.640]   I'm still working on it 18 or 19 years later.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.840]   But I actually still go back and reference that draft.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.240]   And the things that my editor is telling me
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.560]   about the shape of the story
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.240]   are things that I got more right as a 12 year old
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.320]   when I was reading stories similar to my story.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.160]   And I am now.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.040]   So just the way the plot beats hit,
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.240]   the way the elements happen,
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.520]   it's really strange.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.480]   So I think you learn a lot by reading,
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.080]   especially when you're young,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.000]   it just sort of shapes your idea of what a story is
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.480]   in a way that can be very helpful later.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.560]   - I think that's cool.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.280]   And it's almost intangible.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.560]   It becomes part of who you are.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.360]   Like you don't even know that you know it,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.480]   but you can feel what makes a good story.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.760]   I love that.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.800]   I remember, Stephanie, I remember,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.240]   I don't remember if you were eight or nine or 10,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.200]   but you were around that age.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.320]   And we went to the library one time
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   and I had in general been steering
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.920]   at least your selection of books
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.440]   because I wanted you to read what I knew was good
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   and not just trite and trivial and not well done.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.760]   And so I remember the first time you really pushed back
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.120]   and said, "Well, can't I pick my own book?"
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.480]   And I remember thinking,
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.000]   "Oh, I don't think I want to go here."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.200]   But I realized that you needed to stretch
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.440]   and you deserved a choice.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.320]   You were a voracious reader.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.880]   And so I let you pick a book.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.360]   And as you usually did,
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.280]   you started reading as soon as we got back in the car
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.600]   and you read all the way home.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.280]   And when we got home, you went upstairs and you read.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.160]   And it probably was not even 30 minutes later,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.800]   you came back down and put the little book you had chosen.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.280]   And I don't know if it was like "Pony Girl Club"
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.840]   or something, some little paperback book
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.640]   that had caught your eye.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.880]   And you stuffed it back in the library basket.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.760]   And I asked you about the book.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.800]   I asked you if you were done.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.560]   Do you remember this at all?
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   - I remember hearing about the story of it,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.240]   but I can't remember what the book was.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.600]   - Yes, I don't remember.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.680]   I can see the rack you pulled it from.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.840]   But I remember you telling me that it was not,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.680]   that, I think I asked you if you were done
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.320]   and you said, "No, you're not gonna finish it."
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.440]   And I asked you what was the matter?
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   And you told me that the story was not very well told
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.040]   and the characters were not very deep
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.400]   and the story was not believable.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.600]   - And there's still some pet peeves of mine.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.880]   (laughs)
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.080]   - Yes, and I remember,
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   and I just said, "Oh, okay, well just choose another book."
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.520]   And I remember being so happy
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.960]   that you had been raised with enough good books
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.360]   that those deficits jumped out at you,
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.080]   even as a young girl,
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.720]   those deficits jumped out at you
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   and sort of discounted the story.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.680]   You didn't feel compelled to finish it
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.080]   if it wasn't good to chew on,
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.160]   you weren't gonna finish.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.240]   And I was really happy about that.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.480]   I was really.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.440]   What do you think that good literature
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.840]   teaches us about words and emotions and places?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.520]   What does good literature teach us about human nature?
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.080]   - Oh my gosh, this is like my favorite question to answer.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:41.920]   - I love it.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.160]   Well, go on as long as you want to.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.040]   I wanna hear what you think.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.080]   - Well, I just think that almost anything
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.480]   you can learn in the real world
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.640]   and almost anything you can learn in the real world,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.960]   you can learn in part through stories
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.680]   just because stories imitate life.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.280]   And there's a little bit of storyteller in all of us
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.680]   because we're made in the image
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   of the ultimate original storyteller, God.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.240]   - Yes.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.560]   - And through stories, we can watch how decisions
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   and circumstances affect the characters
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.120]   and draw real parallels to our lives
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.360]   and the lives of others.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.680]   So like when you're little,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.600]   maybe you read a story about a character
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.400]   who loses a favorite toy and he's sad
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.280]   and the story maybe even uses the word sad.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.120]   And so you get to see what sad looks like
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.280]   and what causes the sadness.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.600]   And you realize that you've felt sadness before.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   And so you see yourself in that character
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.920]   and you more fully understand the word sad.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.600]   And now you have language for something
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.800]   that you have already felt or certainly will feel
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.520]   at some point as a little person.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.160]   And then maybe in the story,
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   you see how other characters come
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.120]   and help the main character sit with that sadness
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.240]   or look for the lost toy.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.760]   And you see how the community helps the main character
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.320]   and that sadness can be worked through
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.240]   and solutions found.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.760]   And so that character shows you
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.600]   that there's a way out of sadness.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.160]   And then when you feel sad in the real world,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.040]   first of all, you can name that feeling
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.520]   because you've read about it.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.120]   And second, you have a model for a way to work through it.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.600]   And so that's just an example
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.040]   of how stories might affect a young person,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.800]   but the same principles grow with us.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.320]   So when we read about character struggles,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.560]   poor decisions, good decisions, friendships,
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.320]   experiences with political or natural disasters,
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.600]   if we're reading good literature
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.760]   and talking about it with other people,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.080]   we're gaining a kind of experience ourselves
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.480]   that can lie in wait in our subconscious
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.880]   or and surface when we need it.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   So just, I mean, that's so powerful.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.480]   And then, you know, on a different note,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   they can, stories can be an effective way
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.600]   to learn about other time periods or cultures
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.880]   and information does just tend to stick better
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.760]   in our minds when it's woven into a story.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.200]   So like, that's true for the factual aspects,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.520]   but also those emotional beats.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.400]   Things just stick with us when they're through stories.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.280]   - Wow, that is so rich.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.400]   I could pick that apart
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.840]   and we could probably talk for half a day about that.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.880]   I love both of the things you said
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   that reading teaches us odd little bits of knowledge
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.280]   that we don't even realize that we are gathering
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.040]   and filing sometimes away.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.680]   I know if you play, if you read a lot and if you are,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.200]   you read lots of genres or you read about different places
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.320]   or different times, you are probably
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.400]   a really good trivia player
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   because you know a ton of archaic words
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   or odd customs or weird things
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   from different time periods or different places
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.720]   that you don't even know you know.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.120]   They were just like part of the setting
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.680]   or something that the character used
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.440]   or something that appeared in a story.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   So yeah, you will gather odd bits of concrete knowledge
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.400]   about the world as it is and the world as it was.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   But I love what you said that we gain knowledge
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.520]   about emotion and about struggle
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:34.640]   and about possibilities and about human nature.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.760]   I think my favorite thing that you said
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   was that we build knowledge that surfaces when we need it.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.840]   That is awesome.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.280]   What a great reason.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.720]   And what a great reason, listeners,
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.560]   for parents to provide good literature
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   and good characters and to talk about the situations
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.040]   with their student, for you all to talk about the book
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   so that you can find what the character is learning
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.080]   that might be a teachable moment
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.600]   for somebody in your family.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.320]   That is lovely.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.200]   So what kind of things do we learn
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.440]   from literary characters, Stephanie?
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.280]   How can, if we've got listeners today who say,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.040]   yeah, my student is a great reader
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.120]   and they can write some killer papers
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.080]   and their vocabulary is huge
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.000]   and they really are, they're really a good student.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.200]   And I've always wanted my child to be smart,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   but I also want my child to be honorable and truthful
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.080]   and a lover of beauty and merciful
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   and a man or woman of perseverance and honor.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.040]   How can parents use literature discussions
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.280]   as teachable moments for building that kind of character?
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.960]   Yeah, so this can kind of go back
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.440]   to what I was saying earlier, I guess,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.960]   but watching the struggles and decisions
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.240]   of characters gives us a lot to think about
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.680]   in ways that we can apply to ourselves
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   as well as the characters.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.560]   And that's often more comfortable and less impersonal
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360]   when talking about your own struggles
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.920]   or shortcomings directly.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.080]   So, I mean, being vulnerable is hard,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.960]   maybe especially when you're a challenge age student.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.120]   So it is easier to talk about why a character's decision
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.960]   was wise or unwise than it is to talk about
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.040]   the unwise decisions that you yourself have made.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.120]   But I think processing the cause and effect
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.440]   of a character's actions can forge trails
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.640]   in the mind that stick around.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.200]   So I'm a little iffy on suggesting
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.480]   that parents directly use literature
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.600]   to get to matters of the heart and soul,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.080]   just because, depending on the student,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.440]   they may scent what you're up to and-
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.920]   And rebel and not shut down.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.880]   Or sending literature with you
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.680]   trying to hack into their person.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.840]   Oh yes, it's the key to your psyche.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.720]   Yeah, but I do think that establishing the pattern
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.680]   of looking at a story or a character
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.000]   and asking, "Does this remind us
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.640]   of anything in the real world?"
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.840]   And vice versa, when situations come up
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.720]   in real life, establishing that habit of asking,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.400]   "Does this remind us of anything in literature?"
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.520]   can be helpful.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.360]   So maybe not ever directly calling out,
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.120]   "Does this remind you of this time
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.680]   you made this dumb choice?"
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.560]   Right, that would be so off-putting.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.400]   Oh my word.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.720]   Right, but just all the time,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.920]   even when you have nothing specific in mind,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.560]   continuing to forge that trail of looking at literature,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.800]   does that remind you of anything in real life?
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.720]   Looking at real life,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.960]   does that remind you of anything in literature?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.040]   And then, especially if you're going
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.600]   through those conversations
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.160]   and you don't have an agenda,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.400]   that can kind of start to become
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.680]   part of your student's inner voice
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.400]   and something that they're turned onto
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.040]   and analyzing just all the time.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.960]   I love that, part of your student's inner voice.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.640]   I really liked your reminder
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.360]   that when we're watching the struggles of a character
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.520]   and we're discussing that character
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.400]   and what she or he did or thought,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   and then, well, what could they have done
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.680]   or how did that work out well for them?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.800]   How did that work out poorly in the moment
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.440]   and provide a teachable moment for that?
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.080]   How did that character grow and change
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.320]   and maybe develop wisdom from that situation?
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   Talking about the character instead of your student
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.440]   gives your student freedom to think their own thoughts
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.040]   and learn and gain wisdom
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.600]   without feeling like they're under the microscope
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.840]   or feeling like you are heavy-handedly
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.920]   talking about them and some decision.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.080]   If you make a practice of talking about the characters
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   that you guys are reading about and saying,
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.960]   well, why do you think they did that?
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.160]   Do you think they were sorry?
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.680]   Do you think they were glad?
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.760]   What do you think they learned?
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.760]   Do you think if this situation happened again
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.640]   that they would do the same thing?
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.080]   Why does that seem like they grew from that?
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.360]   Did they gain wisdom from the experience?
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.640]   Did they just become harder from the experience?
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.800]   I think all of those things are really good.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.240]   I think that when we discuss the characters
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.680]   or discuss the situations that our students
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.280]   are reading about,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.000]   it can just be a conversational opening
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.600]   for matters of the heart or the soul,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   even if you're not putting it in bluntly personal ways.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:06.080]   You're talking about mercy in general
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   or integrity of this character in this situation.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   What situations is it hard for people of any age
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.920]   to be integrous, that kind of thing?
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.240]   Well, I know we just have a few minutes,
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.200]   but I want to give our listeners, Stephanie,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   some specifics.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   How do we do this thing that you're talking to us about?
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.880]   Let's talk about some of the characters
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.360]   that we meet while we're reading in "Challenge."
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   Now, I know that you were a "Challenge" student.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.760]   You went all the way through the "Challenge" program.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.440]   You have been a "Challenge" director.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.360]   So you have been both a student
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   and a facilitator of discussions about "Challenge" literature.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.680]   And so some of these, I know that you have still opinions
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.640]   about some of these.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.040]   What characters, who do you love?
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.320]   So what are some of the characters in "Challenge" literature
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   that you loved or love?
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.320]   Who do you love to hate?
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.960]   Who's the most complex character to you?
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.920]   And then I have one other question that I want to ask you,
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.000]   but answer those first.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.440]   - Okay.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.960]   So characters that I love,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.680]   I don't want to keep harping on it,
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.920]   but Betsy from "The Hiding Place," love.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.480]   Edward P. Dowd from "Harvey," I love.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   I also love Jane Eyre, and I have not talked about her yet.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.280]   So I love the character of Jane Eyre,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.360]   and I think she would probably also be one
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   that is the most complex to me.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.000]   Let's see, love to hate.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.280]   I mean, I love to hate Uncle Andrew
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.720]   from "The Magician's Nephew."
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.000]   Like, we all just, no one wants to be an Uncle Andrew.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.440]   - Oh, my gosh, yes.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.280]   - And then I also hate, it's a little less fun to hate,
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.760]   but Reverend Demsdale from "Husband and Wife."
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.640]   You know, he's got his own struggles.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   He's not just a straight, easily condemned character as much.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.280]   - Not totally without sympathy, mm-hmm.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.520]   - Yeah, but I respect for him.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.640]   And at the time, I remember not liking Crispin,
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.720]   but I haven't read that since I was very young.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.400]   So I think he's one of those characters
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.920]   that I just wasn't able to see his growth.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.400]   I think he probably grows a lot,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.120]   and I just had stuck in my mind the initial Crispin,
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.760]   who's a little bit of a coward.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   - Right, right, right, right.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   - I didn't like him as a student.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.600]   - Yes, yes, I remember that, yep.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.840]   - Yeah, well, and also St. John,
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.360]   which is spelled like St. John,
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.520]   if you are like me and didn't realize that,
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.160]   'cause it's pronounced St. John from Jane Eyre.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.280]   I don't like him either,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.080]   but I don't wanna get too deep into that
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.840]   because I want readers to be able
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.040]   to discover that for themselves.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.640]   But I also, I don't like St. John.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.960]   And you said Jane Eyre might be
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.920]   the most complex character to you, why?
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.280]   - She's so unusual as a heroine.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   Bronte wanted to write a heroine who was not beautiful
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.800]   and not particularly charismatic.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.280]   And to be able to do that
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.560]   and still have your character carry the story
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.600]   and be so engaging is very interesting to me.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.480]   And I mean, I think I would agree.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.840]   I mean, we're told that Jane is not beautiful,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   so check. - Right, right.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.280]   - Charismatic, she's not charismatic,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.160]   but she is likable.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.920]   - Yes. - She's interesting.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.280]   She's so interesting.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.560]   She's very observant of other people
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.480]   and her insights in other people are fascinating to read.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.240]   She's very incisive.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.520]   She paints really good character sketches
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.360]   of the other characters.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.960]   And a lot of what you get about Jane,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.080]   you get sort of indirectly.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.720]   She does sometimes straight up tell you about her character.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.760]   She says, "I am not this," or "I do not that."
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.880]   But a lot of what you get is indirect.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.720]   And you have to watch what she actually does
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.400]   and actually says to put together who she is.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.240]   And that's such a fun puzzle to work through
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.400]   just with the text
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.960]   and then also with conversations with other people.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.120]   - Yes. - People do tend
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.800]   to have very different opinions on Jane.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.520]   And I love to talk about that
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.960]   because she is someone that I'm very passionate about
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.240]   and I have a very specific opinion
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.520]   on a lot of aspects of her character.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.760]   - Yeah, yeah, she's a very deep character.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.160]   You know, I would agree with you that she's very engaging.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   She is not flashy.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.920]   So she's not a sparkly blue,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   but she is a deep, rich blue.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.520]   She's not sparkly, but she is steady.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:16.400]   She's not flashy, but she is substantial.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.880]   And her character draws you in over time.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.760]   I would agree with that.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.000]   I would agree with that.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.360]   So let me ask you this.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.520]   This might be really personal.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.960]   What, have any of the characters that you've encountered,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.760]   primarily in the challenge reading, but in any reading,
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   have any of the characters led to revelations about yourself?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.080]   - Yeah, tons.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.240]   I mean, short answer is yes, just a lot.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.600]   But one of the ones that comes to my mind
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.560]   is actually Satan from "Paradise Lost,"
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.000]   which is kind of a wild one maybe.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.320]   And this revelation really happened to me in college
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.920]   when I got to encounter the text for the first time.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.800]   But like most students,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.040]   I was fascinated by the character of Satan.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.680]   Milton gives him a lot of the really good lines
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.520]   and he is very charismatic.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.600]   He's basically, he's seductive,
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.480]   which is what he really is.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.720]   - Right.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.200]   - And like as a Christian initially,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.680]   I felt kind of nervous or even guilty
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.760]   about being fascinated with Satan.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.840]   - Yes.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.640]   - But I did want to analyze his character a little bit.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.440]   And so I began to analyze one of his soliloquies
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.640]   in book four of "Paradise Lost."
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.800]   And the paper assignment was to analyze
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   the how of the speech, so to get at the literary devices.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.840]   And so that's what I was doing.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.160]   But you can only look at the how of a speech
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.800]   for so long before you start the what he's talking about.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.400]   And what I realized in Satan's big speech
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.560]   was that he was wrong.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.400]   And I knew that, obviously Satan is in the wrong,
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.560]   like he's Satan, but he'd been really articulate
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.640]   and suave and reasonable in the poem so far.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.560]   But all of a sudden I noticed that his argument
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.880]   wasn't what he meant it to be.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.720]   He talks about not, he wants his freedom.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.920]   He doesn't want to submit to God.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.800]   And he and God are just at odds forever
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   because Satan wants freedom and God wants submission.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.680]   And so Satan's conclusion is that he says to himself,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.280]   "Evil be thou my good."
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.320]   And so he's gonna devote himself to evil instead.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.520]   And I realized that Satan,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.680]   he doesn't choose freedom in that moment.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.920]   He simply decides to make evil his master rather than God.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.360]   And so he's still submitting
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.440]   to something higher than himself,
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.320]   but he's choosing to submit to evil instead of God.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.680]   So he's, you know, God is the only good.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.800]   And when we try to circumvent him,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.000]   we'll only ever settle for something less.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   And so that's maybe a really big sort of lofty thing.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.520]   And I don't know if it's directly like about myself,
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.520]   but mostly I guess what I learned is
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.000]   a little bit more of who God is
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.160]   and who I can trust him to be with myself.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   So it was just a really revelation moment for me
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.280]   to see literature acting that way
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.640]   and making me think through something so big.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.880]   So, I mean, I learned about myself
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.480]   because initially I'm drawn to the evil,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.200]   like humans are, we have that in us.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.840]   But then being allowed to see that the true way
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.880]   of setting yourself free is through God was really cool.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.200]   - That's lovely.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.360]   Thank you.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.200]   Thank you for sharing that.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.400]   Thank you for sharing that.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   I actually think that will give lots of our parents hope
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:11.440]   because what you said is that you met
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.280]   this work of literature and challenge,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.560]   but it didn't leave you there.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.400]   You studied it again and you were able
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.440]   as you had grown and matured,
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.560]   you were able to use your knowledge of literature,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.320]   but your knowledge of logic
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.280]   and your knowledge of spiritual truth
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   to learn something about God and about yourself.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.200]   And that's what as parents,
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.480]   that's what we hope will happen.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.280]   Thanks for sharing that, Stephanie.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.240]   - All right, let me ask you this one last thing.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   There are lots of characters that we meet in literature.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:00.440]   And we can learn from the lessons
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.240]   that these characters learn.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.440]   We can either learn that we want to be like them
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.720]   or that we do not want to be like them.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   Maybe there's just one thing we learn from the character.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.640]   We learn resourcefulness from "The Sign of the Beaver."
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.960]   We learn hope, maybe.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.120]   There are a lot of books that we read.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.400]   We read "The Secret Garden"
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.720]   with our Young Challenge A kids
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.120]   and characters like Mary and Colin and Dickon.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.400]   And we read "To Kill a Mockingbird"
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.960]   and we learn what a really good parent is,
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.800]   a parent who struggles, but a parent who's good.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   And we read "Pride and Prejudice"
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.240]   and man, we learned a lot about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.400]   And even from Elizabeth's father, Mr. Bennett.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.040]   From "The Iliad," we can learn about Hector and Achilles.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.800]   I want you to pick a character that you met,
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.400]   that our students meet in challenge literature.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.920]   Tell us what might we learn from these characters.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.400]   - Oh my gosh, there's so many.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.640]   All of those that you listed are so good.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:17.360]   Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, like as a pair,
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   I think are really fun to talk about
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.040]   because they both learn something.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.840]   It's not just the main character who has to change.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.200]   It's also the secondary character.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.040]   - Yes.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.440]   - And they learned that they were both very similar
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.720]   in ways that needed to change
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.200]   and very different in ways that needed to change.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.840]   And I think we can see ourselves
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.600]   either in one of the two characters or maybe both.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.320]   - Yes, depending on the circumstances, you're right.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.000]   - Yeah, because Elizabeth is, she's the prejudice
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.560]   if we're going to do "Pride and Prejudice."
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.600]   She makes up her mind about Mr. Darcy really early
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.560]   and also he's rich and so he must be a little bit snobby.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.400]   - Right, right.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.560]   - And Mr. Darcy is too proud to explain
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.840]   that he's really just shy is the main thing.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.680]   - Yes, yes.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.920]   - So he had a lot of reasons, good-hearted reasons
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.840]   for doing the things that appeared bad to Elizabeth.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.880]   He's too proud to unpack that for her.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.440]   And so they both have these big character struggles
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.440]   and in the end, they work through both of those
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.200]   and they meet in the middle with so much joy.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.320]   Sorry, that's a spoiler, but I mean,
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.560]   you know where this was going.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.640]   - Yes, I believe that we do.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.600]   - With so much joy and I love that.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:45.120]   I love that to me, it's one of the really good love stories
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.520]   and love stories are not like my favorite type of story,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.480]   but it's such a good one.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.760]   And you learn how to be friends with somebody
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.480]   and help them to sort of shave off those rough edges
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.320]   and have your own rough edges shorn off a little bit.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   So their relationship and the way that Elizabeth
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   handles things is mature in the end, I think.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.680]   And even the mistakes that she makes along the way
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.720]   are very understandable.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.000]   She's not one of those heroines
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.920]   who does wildly ridiculous things that no one can relate to.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.960]   The mistakes she makes are relatable
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.440]   and make sense in the moment.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.000]   And that can remind us that the things that we do
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.640]   maybe did make sense in the moment,
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.680]   but we still need to reassess.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.080]   - Yeah, that's so good.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   There's so, and it makes for some really good discussions
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.000]   and really good talking points
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   and really good considerations.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.600]   Like, would you ever do that?
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.640]   Have you ever done that?
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.200]   Have I ever done that?
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.960]   Parents, when you're having literature discussions,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.120]   don't only put your student under the microscope,
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.760]   do a little self-introspection, maybe share.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.400]   - Yeah, I've made prejudice judgments just like that
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.240]   before I've judged somebody by what they looked like
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.000]   or what I thought they were going to act like
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.240]   or what somebody else said about them
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.840]   instead of getting to know the person
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.640]   or asking some clarifying questions of that person.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.720]   That's really good.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.560]   That's really good.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.640]   All right, I wanna give you a chance
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.440]   to pick one of your favorite characters from "The Iliad,"
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.240]   discuss one of those characters.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.640]   And what did you learn about human nature,
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.080]   about yourself, about life from one of those characters?
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.240]   - Ooh, "The Iliad" is just all about human nature
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.080]   and sort of through the gods as well, which is odd.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:49.480]   But I loved Hector when I read "The Iliad" and "Challenge."
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.080]   He was my favorite.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.320]   I mean, I held him on a pedestal sort of,
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.600]   and I don't love the name Hector,
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.640]   but I was like, if I liked the name,
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.160]   I would name a kid after this character.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.480]   Like, I just love it.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.360]   What I remember in "Challenge"
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.640]   is that he was very honorable and brave
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.680]   and charismatic and a good leader.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.920]   I recently reread "The Iliad"
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.840]   and did not have those same impressions,
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.800]   which is very interesting.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.000]   And I'm very glad that I never named a kid Hector.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.160]   (all laughing)
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.440]   The story has grown.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.680]   Well, the story's been the same.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.840]   That's the cool thing.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.600]   The story's been the same,
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.880]   but I didn't get those same beats.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.680]   And now I want to go back and read my "Challenge" notes.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   Like, where did I see the honorable, brave, charismatic?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.800]   I mean, there are some moments in "The Iliad"
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.400]   where I don't know how I took that away
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.880]   with what actually happens.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.480]   And that's so interesting.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.320]   - Yes.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.680]   - So what I learned about,
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.400]   well, I guess what I learned about human nature,
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.120]   A, is that it's multifaceted
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.000]   and it's going to look different at different times, kind of.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.240]   Human nature is a constant in some ways.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.840]   I mean, people are always going to be bent
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.640]   toward selfishness and self-preservation
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.240]   and want to make decisions that make them look good.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:17.880]   But also, human nature is change a little bit
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.160]   in that people do grow and mature
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.760]   and the decisions that you looked at one way
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.920]   at one point in your life,
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.840]   you can look at differently later.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.120]   And so really one of the things I learned
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.600]   from literature here is that you have to keep assessing
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.480]   and keep paying attention to books and to life.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.440]   You need to keep your priorities in line with the truth,
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.560]   with what God is revealing to you.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.200]   And some of that is going to shift
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.800]   as you hopefully become more Christ-like, so.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.520]   - I love that.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.920]   Oh, I love that.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.360]   Okay, very, very last question, I promise.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.360]   Why is a story such a grand vehicle for expressing truth?
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:10.560]   You were just talking about aligning our lives
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.120]   with the truth and finding the truth.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.320]   Why is story such a grand vehicle for expressing truth?
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.560]   - I mean, everything we've said so far,
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.000]   we're wired for stories
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.640]   because we're made in the image of God.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:30.400]   And so stories get into our hearts
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.960]   in a way that is just very human.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.880]   And it opens up the door for these conversations,
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.520]   for community, for introspection,
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.360]   little facts stick in your brain better
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.600]   when they are through stories.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.120]   It's such a grand vehicle for expressing truth
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.200]   just for all of the reasons,
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.040]   all of the ways that make expressing truth effective
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.880]   can be found in stories.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.800]   And that's why God speaks to us through the Bible
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.720]   and why He maybe spoke the world into being.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.400]   Yeah, stories are just very unique
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   in the way that they can speak deeply to all people.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.960]   - Yeah, yep, they get at your heart in a way.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.040]   And I think that's why Jesus taught
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.920]   using parables and stories.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.640]   They get at your heart in deep
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.200]   and sometimes very unexpected ways.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.280]   Stephanie, thank you so much for being with us today
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:33.160]   and helping us to explore characters in literature
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.560]   and how we can, as parents, have some really good,
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   deep, maybe life-forming discussions with our students.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.800]   I appreciate you sharing today, I really do.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.080]   - Thank you for giving me a chance
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.520]   to ramble about these things.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.840]   - Yes, I love it.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.720]   And parents, if you are looking
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.440]   to be a better everyday educator,
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.520]   let me invite you to check out
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   the 2025 Practicum event that's coming close to you.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:11.200]   Classical Conversations leaders host Practicums every summer,
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.280]   they're parent conferences that give an opportunity
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.400]   for new and experienced homeschool parents
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.360]   to gather and learn and practice the classical arts.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.640]   If you are interested in an opportunity like that,
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.400]   rubbing shoulders with like-minded home educators,
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.560]   maybe growing in your own use of the tools
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.560]   and skills of classical learning,
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   check out ccpracticum.com
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.600]   and you'll be able to find out
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.880]   when your local practicum meets.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.160]   That would be a great opportunity
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.520]   for you to maybe have some discussions
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.600]   like we have enjoyed having today with Stephanie.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.120]   Stephanie, thanks again.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.920]   Listeners, I will look forward to talking to you next week.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.760]   Bye-bye.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.680]   (gentle music)
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.740]   you
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.800]   you
