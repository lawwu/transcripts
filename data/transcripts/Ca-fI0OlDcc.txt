[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   meeting of intermediate biblical counseling. It's a great joy to be
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.060]   able to gather tonight and to be able to continue our study of God's Word. I trust
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.740]   that the Lord has been blessing you and blessing your studies and just look
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.780]   forward to a wonderful time tonight looking at a very important topic on
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.620]   common grace. And so I do want to wish you all a very happy Father's Day and
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:36.380]   trust that the Lord is blessing you as you appreciate our earthly fathers, but
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.380]   even more importantly, it's a day to celebrate our relationship with our
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.780]   gracious Heavenly Father who has sent His Son to die for our sins and to
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.860]   reconcile us to Himself. And so we do rejoice in our relationship with our
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.540]   Heavenly Father whom we can draw near to and the scripture says that we are
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.060]   indeed sons of God in Christ and that is a great joy to be able to celebrate that
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.980]   today. Well tonight, before I pray, I want to open our time with a devotion from
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.300]   Matthew chapter 5 verses 43 to 48 and if you have your Bibles you can go ahead
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.540]   and turn there. This is gonna be a key passage that we'll look at tonight as it
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.460]   relates to theology exam number 5 on common grace and I think it's also a
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.940]   good passage to encourage us in our walks with Christ and also has some
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.940]   implications for counseling ministry. So let me go ahead and read Matthew 5
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.140]   verses 43 to 48 for us and we'll use this as a time to prepare our hearts to
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.860]   our study tonight. Jesus said this, "You have heard that it was said you shall
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.300]   love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I say to you love your enemies and
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.320]   pray for those who persecute you so that you may be sons of your Father who is in
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.140]   heaven for he makes his son rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.560]   the just and on the unjust for if you love those who love you what reward do
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.740]   you have do not even the tax collectors do the same and if you greet only your
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.660]   brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the Gentiles do the
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.900]   same you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." I was
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.020]   teaching on the Sermon on the Mount this past Wednesday and reflecting on the
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.780]   Beatitudes which open the Sermon on the Mount, "Blessed are the poor in spirit for
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.420]   theirs is the kingdom of heaven," and just reflecting on this whole idea that the
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.940]   principles of Christ's kingdom are so radically different from the kingdom of
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.340]   man or the kingdom of this world. In the kingdom of man you have pride and
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.300]   self-sufficiency, you have personal retaliation, you have an eye for an eye,
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.460]   tooth for tooth, you have this unrelenting desire to be right and never
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.980]   to be wronged, and if you look at the principles of Christ's kingdom in
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.100]   Matthew 5, the values are so very different, they're the very opposite.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.320]   "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven, blessed
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.140]   are the humble, blessed are the gentle, the meek, those who have power under
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:40.780]   control, blessed are those who mourn over sin and a desire to be right with God," and
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.820]   you just see how the principles of Christ's kingdom are so radically
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:52.180]   different from the kingdoms of this world, and that makes sense because Jesus
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:02.620]   said in John 18 verse 36 that my kingdom is not of this world. So Jesus continues
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.060]   this theme of how his kingdom is so different from the kingdom of this world
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.540]   in verse 43, and basically what he says in this passage is that the subjects of
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.820]   his kingdom are characterized by grace in their relationships with others. They
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.740]   don't treat others the way that others deserve to be treated, they treat others
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.700]   according to the principle of grace, they give unmerited favor to others. Subjects
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.940]   of Christ's kingdom don't only love their friends, they love their enemies,
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.140]   they don't only love those who love them, subjects of Christ's kingdom love
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.260]   those who persecute them and who are their enemies, and Jesus says in
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.940]   Matthew 5 verse 43, "You have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.500]   and hate your enemy," and by the way, that's not what the Word of God said.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.380]   Leviticus 19 verse 18 says, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," but then
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.580]   Jewish tradition added that statement, "You shall hate your enemy," and we can
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.900]   understand why a man would turn that into a standard like that because that's
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.700]   basically the natural operation of the human heart is to love your friends and
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.660]   hate your enemies, and Jesus is drawing a contrast between the principles of man's
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.380]   kingdom with the principles of his kingdom. He says, "You have heard that it
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.620]   was said you can hate your enemy," but verse 44, "I say to you love your enemies
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.020]   and pray for those who persecute you." So I just want to, this passage is going to
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.460]   be key to our essay tonight, but I also just want to make some practical
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.940]   applications and draw out some counseling implications for this passage.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.340]   What we face in counseling often is helping people to reconcile. I mean, that
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:18.340]   would be a lot of marriage counseling, which is probably about 50% of or more
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.100]   of counseling is marriage counseling, just helping husband and wife to
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.220]   reconcile, to forgive, to love one another. There's also reconciliation
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.380]   between fathers and sons and daughters and neighbors and even reconciliation
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.380]   between church members, and that's a lot of what we do in counseling is helping
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.220]   people to make peace, and I think the fundamental truth that we're trying to
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.380]   communicate in our counseling ministry is that if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.580]   you don't just love your friends, you love your enemies, you don't just love
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:03.180]   people who love you back, but you love people who don't love you back, and when
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.420]   you begin to adopt that kingdom mentality of grace in your relationships,
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:14.740]   of showing favor to those who don't return anything in response, then you are
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:22.260]   living out the principles of Christ's kingdom. In marriage counseling, oftentimes
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.540]   husband and wife come in, and the husband does an incredible job of confessing the
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.820]   wife's sin, and he confesses the wife's sin with clarity, with accuracy, with
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.460]   perfect memory, with records, dates and times, and specific examples and
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:48.020]   illustrations, and then the wife confesses the husband's sin and does the
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:57.500]   very same thing, and we work with people in teaching them from the Bible that you
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.100]   are called not only to love your spouse if your spouse loves you
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.500]   back, but even if your spouse does not love you back, to be a subject of Christ's
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:16.540]   kingdom is to love, is to pray for those who bless you, is to not revile those who
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.060]   revile you. If a husband's saying my wife is disrespectful, she's unsubmissive, she's
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:32.540]   selfish, she undermines me, it's helping that person love with the love of Christ.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:41.060]   Verse 45, Jesus says, gives us the reason why we are to love in this way. He says,
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:46.980]   "So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, for he makes his Son
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:53.460]   rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.740]   This is the perfect verse for Father's Day. It's a great word that we are sons
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.340]   of the Father who is in heaven, and essentially, Jesus says here that
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.660]   subjects of his kingdom are characterized by grace in their
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:16.180]   relationships because they are children of a Heavenly Father who shows grace to
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:25.940]   the just and to the unjust. This is just something that I pray we will celebrate
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.320]   about our Heavenly Father. If you stop to think about it, that our Heavenly Father
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.060]   is filled with grace toward his enemies. He shows goodness and kindness not just
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.980]   to people who love him, but he shows his goodness and kindness to people who hate
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:53.500]   him, and our Heavenly Father is gracious toward his enemies, and that's gonna set
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:00.020]   the table for our discussion tonight on common grace. What common grace is, is
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:08.740]   God's unmerited favor toward both believers and unbelievers, and you
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.460]   realize this every day that unbelievers wake up every morning, they hate God, they
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.900]   blaspheme God, they want nothing to do with Christ, they don't worship the true
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:28.940]   and the living God, they despise his word, they despise his law, and yet for even
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.500]   the unbeliever, God causes the sun to rise in the morning, God feeds them with
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:41.420]   food, God shelters them with a roof over their heads. For many unbelievers, God
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:47.900]   even gives them a good job that they can go and make money and prosper. God
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.740]   continues to show kindness and goodness not just to believers in this world, but
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:59.620]   he shows kindness to unbelievers, and that's the theological category of common
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:08.340]   grace. It's God's unmerited favor toward believers and unbelievers. God is
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.860]   gracious toward believers in that he gives them saving grace, and he gives
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.220]   them forgiveness of sins and eternity in heaven, status as being an adopted child
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:26.140]   of God, and all of that he gives to believers. But even to the unbeliever
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:32.500]   whom God has not saved, at least up to this point, even to the unbeliever living
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:39.780]   in darkness, God feeds that person, God shelters that person, God withholds his
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.460]   judgment, and he shows kindness. And that's what theologians call "common
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:53.060]   grace." And what Jesus is saying in Matthew chapter 5 is that when you see
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.140]   God being gracious to people who hate him, to his enemies, when you see the sun
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:06.260]   rising every morning on unbelievers who hate the Lord, and God continuing to
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.780]   preserve their life and give them health and give them even enjoyable things to
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:19.340]   do in this world, that ought to drive you to reflect the same image, to reflect the
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.860]   same likeness, to be sons of the Father who is in heaven. And you ought to see
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.420]   how gracious God is toward people who hate him, and that ought to cause you to
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:39.820]   love your enemies. Now, I share this devotion tonight, and the great thing and
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.980]   the hard thing about any devotion on personal relationships is it requires
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.380]   immediate application. All of us are gonna have the opportunity this week, and
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.780]   some of us are gonna have the opportunity tonight to put this into
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:04.500]   practice, and to come across a person who is unkind, who is disrespectful, who is
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:13.860]   hurtful, who maybe doesn't like you, who gets in your way, who maybe even insults
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:20.220]   you, and you and I are gonna have a choice at that point whether to live
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:29.660]   according to the principles of man's kingdom and retaliate, or to live
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.180]   according to the principles of Christ's kingdom and to love our enemies and to
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:41.300]   do good to those who who do not do good to us. And that's gonna set the table for
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.140]   our essay, but also for our own personal application. We can't help counselees to
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.280]   live in this way if we're not living this way ourselves, and so let me just
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.900]   challenge all of us and to encourage us to love our enemies, to do good to those
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:05.820]   who do not do good to us, and so reflect the character of our gracious Heavenly
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.900]   Father who shows his kindness to both believers and unbelievers. So let me pray
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.300]   for us, and we'll go over our essay topic tonight. Father, thank you so much for
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:24.580]   your amazing grace. We tend to celebrate most often your saving grace, and
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:31.100]   rightly so, for you are a saving God who has delivered us from the domain of
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.180]   darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of your beloved Son. But Father,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:42.220]   help us tonight to understand your common grace, to understand the
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:49.620]   astounding truth that you show your kindness even to the unbeliever, even to
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:57.820]   the person who hates you. You treat them not according to what they deserve, but
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:04.780]   you withhold your judgment. You give time and space to repent. You give food and
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:13.620]   shelter. You give enjoyable pursuits in life, and you just show kindness, Lord, to
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:21.540]   the unbeliever. We just pray that we might understand your character and that
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.860]   we ourselves might reflect that in our own dealings with others, that we would
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:32.260]   be gracious and kind and merciful, that we would love our enemies, pray for those
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:41.180]   who persecute us, and bless those who revile us, and so be sons of our Father
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:47.140]   who is in heaven. This Father's Day, we thank you for our earthly fathers, but
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.580]   Father, we thank you most of all that you are our Heavenly Father, and you are
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.980]   gracious to us as your children. So bless us tonight as we look at your word, and
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.620]   we pray all this in Christ's name, amen.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:08.060]   Okay, well, we are looking at tonight the subject of common grace. I hope you all
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:17.580]   can see the slides, and I've got this Zoom thing working okay. So, common grace.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:27.040]   This is the subject of tonight's topic, and the question on theology exam number
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:34.020]   five is to explain the doctrine of common grace relating the doctrine to
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.140]   the ability of secular psychologists to understand true information about the
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:45.740]   human condition. So that's page one on your handout. We have the doctrine of
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.140]   common grace. There's two parts to this question. The first is to explain common
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.060]   grace, what is common grace, and what are the passages of scripture that speak to
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:02.100]   common grace, and then you have a second part of the question to relate that
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:08.060]   doctrine to the ability of secular psychologists to understand the human
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:17.340]   condition. So basically, ACBC wants you to interact with the integrationist
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:25.360]   perspective that a secular psychologist under common grace can understand who
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.180]   man is and help man with his problems. So let me give you a slide here that I
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:39.220]   think will explain what we're looking at here. That's a little bit later on, but
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:46.340]   here we go with the grace of God. What we're looking at here under the broader
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.780]   category of God's grace. God's grace can be defined as his unmerited favor, and
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:58.340]   there are two categories of God's grace. There's common grace, which is God's
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.900]   unmerited favor extended to all men, and that's believers and unbelievers, and
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.660]   then there is saving grace, which is God's unmerited favor extended to
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:16.640]   believers only. As I prayed, we tend to focus in on saving grace, and a lot of
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:23.340]   our songs and hymns and messages, sermons, celebrate the saving grace of God and
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:30.280]   Jesus Christ, celebrate our forgiveness of sins, our standing in his unmerited
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.940]   favor, our peace with God, our reconciliation to God, all of that
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:40.780]   focuses in on saving grace, but I would ask you this question. When is the last
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:50.340]   time you've heard a sermon or a message on common grace? It's kind of an area of
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.280]   theology that we don't often focus on, and yet I think if we understand God's
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.060]   common grace, we'll be equipped to love the Lord and to celebrate an essential
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:10.500]   aspect of his character. Common grace is God's grace given to all men, believers,
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:20.700]   and unbelievers, so the truth is that you and I ought to wake up every morning and
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:29.820]   be amazed by God's common grace. We ought to be amazed by his grace to believers
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:38.100]   and unbelievers. We ought to be astounded by the fact that so many people in this
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:47.420]   world hate the Lord and trample upon his word, and yet God continues to show
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:55.660]   kindness to them. It really ought to be a truth that amazes us, that every day man
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:02.140]   does things that would invite the judgment and the wrath of God. Every day
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:12.580]   man disobeys God's Word, and yet God continues to show his kindness to them.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:18.900]   The average unbeliever in America wakes up every morning, the sun is shining,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:25.700]   there's food to eat, gets in a car, drives to work, enjoys productive labor, comes
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:34.300]   home to a family, has shelter, a roof over his head, and then on the weekends goes
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:41.540]   hiking or goes to the ocean or goes to the beach and enjoys some recreation. You
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:47.260]   and I ought to look at that and say, "Amazing grace, that is amazing grace, that
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:54.900]   an unbeliever who hates God is shown such kindness." I became a believer
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:04.780]   in February of 1992, so don't do the math here, but that means for 20 years I was
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:12.740]   a recipient of common grace. I lived as an unbeliever, I hated the Lord, I
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:20.980]   blasphemed his name, I made fun of Christians, and for 20 years God kept my
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:29.060]   heart beating, God kept me alive, God put me in a nice family, God gave me
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:36.740]   educational opportunities. The fact that the first time I blasphemed the Lord
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:45.900]   Jesus Christ, God didn't strike me down and allow his fiery wrath to consume me.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:51.740]   The fact that my my lungs kept breathing and my heart kept beating is evidence of
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:57.580]   God's common grace. Just the fact that he endured with my sins so long and gave me
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:07.780]   time and space to repent is an expression of his common grace. And then
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:14.420]   in February 1992, I trusted in the gospel, gave my life to Christ, and at that point
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:21.660]   I received saving grace. And so I have received both common grace and saving
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:30.380]   grace in my life, and that astounds me. I mean, the grace of God ought to astound us.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.980]   We ought to be astounded by common grace, and as I rehearse my testimony, I'm
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.740]   celebrating common grace. I would not have had the opportunity to repent and
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:48.380]   believe in Christ if God had struck me dead when I first blasphemed his name.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:59.580]   But God has shown me his common grace in giving me time and space to repent. I'm
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.660]   gonna make an application to food at this point because I am Korean and we
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.500]   have some pretty good food. Oh, that's an understatement. We have really good food.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:17.140]   Korean barbecue is, I think, one of the marvelous expressions of common grace in
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:25.100]   this world. And I took my wife out for her birthday back when the restaurants
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:32.220]   were all open, and we went to this amazing Korean barbecue restaurant. The
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:38.940]   restaurant was filled with smoke and just slabs of meat being barbecued, and
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.220]   everyone in that restaurant looked happy. They looked like they were enjoying
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:50.180]   themselves, and I remember saying to my wife that night on her birthday that
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:55.620]   there is an amazing concentration of common grace in this room tonight
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.340]   because I don't think all of these people are believers. In fact, I would
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:05.260]   guess that many of them are unbelievers, and yet the fact that God is feeding
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:11.980]   them with such amazing food is an expression of his common grace. He's not
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.480]   treating them according to what they deserve because what they deserve is the
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.660]   wrath of God because of their sins. So all that to say, you and I ought to be
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:32.140]   amazed by common grace. This is from Donald Gray Barnhouse. He writes, "You are
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.440]   not a believer in Christ, and yet you are still out of hell. That is the grace of
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.380]   God. You are not in hell, but you are on earth in good health and prosperity. That
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.340]   is the common grace of God. The vast majority of those who read these words
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.140]   are living in comfortable homes or apartments. That is common grace. You are
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.620]   not fleeing as refugees along the highways of a country desolated by war.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:02.420]   That is common grace. You come home from your job and your child runs to meet you
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.840]   in good health and spirits. That is common grace. You're able to put your
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.000]   hand in your pocket and give the child a quarter or a half dollar for an
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.820]   allowance. It is common grace that you have such abundance. You go into your
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:20.780]   house and sit down to a good meal. That is common grace. On the day that you read
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.500]   these words, there are more than a billion and a half members of the human
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.040]   race who will go to sleep without enough to satisfy their hunger. The fact that
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.380]   you have enough is common grace. You do not deserve it, and if you think that you
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.940]   do deserve anything at all from God beyond the wrath which you have so
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:42.740]   richly earned, you merely show your ignorance of spiritual principles." And
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:49.340]   then this quote from Chuck Swindoll and Roy Zuck. They write, "Every human has been
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:56.460]   graced by God with the sense of sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Even though
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.340]   the world is under the curse of sin, it is replete with opportunities to enjoy
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.540]   viewing the power of Niagara Falls, the massive depth and colors of the Grand
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:12.020]   Canyon, or the quiet fragile beauty of the Olympic National Rainforest. How
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.760]   pleasant it is to enjoy the soft touch of a baby's hand, and who does not enjoy
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:26.700]   the aroma and taste of culinary delights." So moving to page two of your handout, we
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:33.260]   want to ask the question, "What is common grace? What is common grace?" And you have
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.180]   there on your handout a number of definitions by theologians. Wynne
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:43.100]   Grudem writes that, "Common grace is the grace of God by which he gives people
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:50.580]   innumerable blessings that are not part of salvation." So you notice here that this
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:57.860]   is non-saving grace. Common grace does not make a person a Christian. This is
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:05.580]   the grace of God that gives many blessings, but not salvation. It does
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:13.020]   not bring anyone into Christ's kingdom. It does not reconcile an unbeliever to a
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.900]   holy God, but there are many blessings that are not part of his salvation.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.220]   Charles Robby writes, "The common grace may be defined as the unmerited favor of
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.620]   God toward all men displayed in his general care for them." And then Heath
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.620]   Lambert has an entire chapter, I believe it's chapter three, of "A Theology of
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.220]   Biblical Counseling," and you will want to read that entire chapter for this
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:45.740]   essay because he does go into some great depth of what is common grace and how
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   does it relate to the ministry of biblical counseling. It says, "Common grace
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.620]   is the good kindness of God that he shows to all people regardless of
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.560]   whether they have experienced the salvation that comes through Jesus
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.580]   Christ. It is called common because it comes to all people, believers and
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.740]   unbelievers alike. It is referred to as grace because this kindness of God is
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   undeserved." So we mentioned Matthew 5 verse 44 to 45, "The father who is in
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:21.940]   heaven makes his son rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:28.500]   and the unjust." Luke 6 verse 35, "But love your enemies and do good and lend,
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.340]   expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great for you will be
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:40.620]   sons of the Most High, for he is kind," note there, "he is kind to the ungrateful
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:46.900]   and the evil." I don't know how many people went out of that Korean barbecue
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:56.280]   restaurant thanking and praising God for his kindness in Jesus Christ, but they
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:03.900]   all ate the same food. And so even to the ungrateful, God shows his his kindness
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:10.300]   and his goodness. Acts 14 verse 16 says, "In past generations he allowed all the
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.620]   nations to walk in their own ways, yet he did not leave himself without witness,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:20.940]   for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:30.620]   your hearts with food and gladness." Psalm 145 verse 9, "The Lord is good to all and
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:36.580]   his mercy is over all that he has made." Verse 15, "The eyes of all look to you and
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:43.260]   you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, you satisfy the
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:51.860]   desire of every living thing." Wayne Grudem writes that, "Unbelievers continue
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.620]   to live in this world solely because of God's common grace. Every breath that
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.700]   people take is of grace, for the wages of sin is death, not life. The beauty of
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.460]   multicolored flowers, of grass and woodlands, of rivers and lakes and
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.900]   mountains and ocean shore still remains as a daily testimony to the continuing
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.420]   common grace of God. Unbelievers deserve to enjoy none of this beauty, but by God's
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:23.740]   grace they can enjoy much of it for their whole lives." So just a note here
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:30.420]   that unbelievers show their lack of gratitude for common grace and the fact
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:41.860]   that when common grace is withheld, they howl injustice. They say God is unjust if
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:52.260]   common grace is withheld, when the reality is that God treats them not
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:02.180]   according to their sins, and it is his right to withhold grace. He is not unjust.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:08.620]   He does not need to show grace. He's under no obligation to treat people
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:18.500]   with undeserved favor, and I think that's true of all of us that at times when God
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:26.020]   withholds his grace, we can indict God's character in saying he's not fair, when
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:32.180]   in reality if he gave us what was fair, then all of us would be in hell for our
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:39.220]   sins, and he has been very gracious to us. So I just encourage you to take this
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.540]   opportunity as you study this essay to once again be amazed by God's grace. Now
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   let's move to some elements of common grace. You have here physical blessings.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:57.460]   These are, as Paul ends, writes, "Those general blessings such as rain and
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.260]   sunshine, food and drink, clothing and shelter, which God imparts to all men
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:07.020]   indiscriminately, where and in what measure it seems good to him. God gives
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.140]   sunshine and rainfall to the atheistic farmer that enables him to harvest his
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:18.860]   crop just as he provides for the Christian farmer." So my wife and I went
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:27.620]   to Target because we live the high life in our household, and this was I
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:33.140]   think a date night that we went to Target, and we were in search of chocolate,
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:40.580]   and whenever we go to Target to search for chocolate, my wife always texts our
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.660]   kids and says, "What kind of chocolate do you want?" and they all text us, you know,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.620]   they want dark chocolate, they want milk chocolate, they want chocolate with
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:55.460]   peanuts, chocolate with almonds, chocolate in bunny-shaped sizes, big chocolate,
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:01.980]   small chocolate, I mean there's all sorts of chocolates that they want, and we were
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.220]   in Target and we could find every variation, almost every variation of
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:12.060]   chocolate was there in the aisle, just this abundance of chocolate. I mean take
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:17.220]   your pick of dozens of types of chocolates that are available not at a
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:24.300]   chocolate store, but at just a regular Target. You don't have to be a
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:33.980]   believer to go into Target and enjoy that incredible bounty of blessing of
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.420]   all these abundant blessings in Target. You can be an unbeliever and you can
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:46.300]   walk in there and that is an expression of God's common grace that you can have
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:54.580]   every type of dessert and every type of chocolate that is available in America.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:34:02.460]   If you and I can walk into a Ralph's or pavilions or a Costco or 7-eleven and
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:10.780]   not be amazed by common grace, then we need to do some some theology. We need to
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:17.140]   be amazed once again at the fact that unbelievers are given so many physical
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:24.300]   blessings. Let me move to a second element which is the withholding of judgment, the
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:31.180]   withholding of judgment. This is Genesis 6 verse 11. God judged the world through
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:39.860]   the universal flood in the days of Noah and destroyed the life of
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:45.220]   man and living creatures. Genesis 19 verse 24, the Lord rained on Sodom and
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.220]   Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.620]   cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.900]   on the ground. But Lot's wife behind him looked back and she became a pillar of
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:05.060]   salt. As Billy Graham has famously said, if God doesn't judge America, then he's
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:15.260]   going to have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah. We are a sinful nation. Romans
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.340]   1 verse 29 says they were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.820]   covetousness, malice. They're full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.780]   They're gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.620]   evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, and ruthless. And
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:45.460]   yet God has shown his common grace to America. I love my country and I plead
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:54.460]   for God's grace upon this country and God has been gracious to America and yet
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:59.220]   I understand that this is according to his grace. It's not because of our moral
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.900]   superiority. It is just the fact that he has shown common grace to us as a
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:13.580]   country even though we have mostly unbelievers in our country. So this is a
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:20.220]   little bit like if you have a teenager who lives in your house and you love
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:26.040]   that teenager, you feed him, you care for him, and every day that teenager wakes up
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:32.820]   and says, "I hate you, mom and dad," and you continue to feed and to care for
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.620]   that teenager and every day he wakes up and says, "I hate you even more. I despise
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:46.100]   you. I hate you," and you continue for years to love and to care for that
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:55.060]   teenager and your love for that teenager does not make the hatred go away. In fact,
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:03.260]   it just increases that teen's hostility. What kind of patience would it take for
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:09.260]   you as a parent to wake up the next day and to continue to love that child?
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:16.460]   That's an illustration of what unbelievers do to God every day. They
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.260]   say, "I hate you," and yet God every day continues to show his kindness and his
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.820]   goodness. That's the withholding of judgment and 2 Peter 3 says he
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:32.780]   does this because he wants to give men space to repent. And then you have a
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:38.100]   letter C, the restraining of sin. All hearts are evil, but not all hearts
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.380]   express the full extent of their depravity. God puts a limit on the
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.540]   expression of men's sin, sometimes through laws and government, sometimes by
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:53.220]   limiting the opportunities to sin. God protected Cain, though Cain was a
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:38:00.860]   murderer. God limited Satan's activity in Job's life. 2 Thessalonians 2 verse 7
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.180]   says, "The mystery of lawlessness is at work. Only he who now restrains it will
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.740]   do so until he is out of the way." So the Holy Spirit restrains the full
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.260]   expression of man's sin, but in the seven-year tribulation that is to come,
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:20.860]   that restraint will be removed and you'll see man give full expression to
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:30.180]   the depravity that is in his heart. The fact that our planet in this nuclear age
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.220]   has not been consumed with nuclear war is an expression of common grace, that
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:43.180]   God has withheld the full expression of man's sinfulness. And so there is a
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:49.940]   restraining of sin that is an element of God's common grace. And then letter D is
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:55.780]   really to our point in why we're writing this essay. There are intellectual
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:05.220]   blessings with common grace. So let me just say on one hand at this point that
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:14.860]   from one perspective, unbelievers are really smart. I mean, we just have to
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:21.180]   affirm that, that from an intellectual perspective, unbelievers do some amazing
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:27.060]   things with their minds. They build bridges, they design smartphones, they
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:34.100]   build cars, they design spaceships that go to the moon and back, they solve
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:41.420]   calculus problems, they design pharmaceuticals, and they build
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:48.340]   skyscrapers, they write literature, they write music that is
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:55.340]   beautiful and amazing. So from an intellectual perspective, man does do,
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:01.660]   even without the Holy Spirit, just on a purely intellectual level, there are
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:07.580]   some really smart unbelievers in this world that, you know, I have to concede
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:13.340]   that there are many, many unbelievers who are just much smarter than I am in terms
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:21.100]   of their intellectual capacity and their intellectual ability. No one in the
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.540]   biblical counseling movement is saying that unbelievers lack intelligence.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:31.300]   That would not be a true statement. Unbelievers have intelligence because
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:38.580]   they're made in the image of God. What we are saying is that the unbelieving mind
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:47.420]   is so affected by sin that the unbeliever will use that intelligence to
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:54.620]   argue against the true and the living God. The unbeliever will take all of the
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.420]   intellectual capacity that has been given to him by God and then use that
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:08.060]   capacity to argue against God and to attack God. And so unbelievers are
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:15.260]   intelligent but they are not neutral. The unbeliever is hostile in mind toward
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:21.500]   God. But the point of this letter D is to say that unbelievers do have intellectual
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:27.380]   blessings. I mean, unbelievers will, every time you turn on the radio and listen to
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.020]   a nice piece of music written by an unbeliever and enjoy that piece of music,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:40.420]   you are witnessing to the common grace of God. So Wayne Grudem talks
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.980]   about this, the intellectual blessings. This is under letter D. All science and
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.260]   technology carried out by non-Christians is a result of common grace, allowing
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.460]   them to make incredible discoveries and inventions, to develop the earth's
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.300]   resources into many material goods, to produce and distribute those resources,
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.220]   and to have skill in their productive work. In a practical sense, this means
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.580]   that every time we walk into a grocery store, or ride in an automobile, or enter
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.620]   a house, we should remember that we are experiencing the results of the abundant
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:15.760]   common grace of God poured out so richly on all mankind. And as Heath Lambert
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.820]   writes in chapter 3 of Theology of Biblical Counseling, saved and unsaved
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:30.860]   people are able to know correct information. So this is, in an algebra
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:37.540]   class, you can have a, or any math class, you can have an unbeliever who says 2
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:46.220]   plus 2 equals 4, and that unbeliever would know correct information. And then
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.140]   you have a believer who's filled with the Holy Spirit, and that believer might
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.380]   say, you know, to the glory of God and for the glory of Christ, 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.780]   But the answer would be the same. Both saved and unsaved people are able to
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:07.460]   know correct information. And so under common grace there are intellectual
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.180]   blessings. I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful every time I drive on the
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.300]   freeway, or get in a car that was made by an unbeliever, I'm thankful for common
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.420]   grace that this car, probably designed by an unbeliever, is able to drive on a
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:36.180]   freeway and be safe. So why is ACBC asking you to write this essay? Let me
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:48.140]   back up and look at last week's essay. Last week we saw that ACBC wanted you to
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.780]   write an essay on general revelation and special revelation, because they wanted
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.940]   you to respond to the integrationist argument. The integrationist argument is
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:02.580]   basically that God has given us general revelation in creation, and special
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:08.380]   revelation in scripture, and that we should use both to help people change.
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.220]   And so they would classify secular psychology under general revelation,
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:18.120]   scripture under special revelation, and make the argument that we have to use
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.380]   both general and special revelation to help people change, and so we should
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:28.980]   integrate secular psychology and scripture. And last week ACBC wanted you
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:36.540]   to respond to that idea, and the basic response is that no unbeliever accepts
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:45.540]   general revelation. No unbeliever, from a secular perspective, looks at general
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.100]   revelation and comes to accurate conclusions. So under the left-hand
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.780]   column, if you're looking at secular psychology, you're gonna have a very
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:00.380]   distorted understanding of general revelation, if you are looking at
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.340]   revelation from a purely secular view. And if you try to combine that with
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:09.800]   scripture, you're gonna come up with a hybrid that is flawed and faulty. But
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.500]   that was the general integrationist argument that ACBC wanted
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.540]   you to respond to, that our focus is on special revelation, scripture, because
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:27.220]   only scripture has the power to convert the soul. So with that in mind, today's
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:33.220]   topic is similar. The integrationist argument is basically that we should use
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:40.100]   both common grace and saving grace to help people change, and they would
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:45.700]   classify secular psychology under common grace, scripture under saving grace, and
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:52.260]   make an argument for integration saying that we should use both. We should use
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:57.420]   the intellectual discoveries of unbelievers in psychology, and we should
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:04.900]   use scripture and bring them into a type of hybrid. Now you would look at that, and
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.860]   I guess from a conceptual standpoint, you might look at that and say, "Well, that
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.420]   makes sense. You should use both. You want all of the grace of God, right? And so
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:16.220]   maybe we should integrate secular psychology and scripture." But what's
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:25.180]   wrong with that argument? So very, very quickly, what this argument does not, what
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:31.800]   this doesn't capture is the fact that common grace has limitations. Common
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:39.100]   grace, as wonderful as it is, has limitations. And if you don't understand
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:44.740]   those limitations, you're gonna come up with a flawed understanding of an
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:51.820]   approach to counseling. So what are the limitations to common grace? The first
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:57.660]   limitation under letter A is that common grace does not save. Common grace does
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.260]   not save. Common grace does not lead anyone to the saving knowledge of Jesus
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:07.580]   Christ. You need saving grace to become a Christian. So common grace does not save
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:12.540]   anyone. Common grace is for unbelievers and unbelievers. Saving grace is for
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:19.300]   believers only. Common grace delays judgment for time. Saving grace satisfies
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:25.980]   judgment in Christ. It doesn't just delay it. It satisfies God's judgment in Christ
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:31.240]   so that we no longer bear the judgment of God. Common grace gives physical
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.060]   blessings, but only saving grace gives spiritual blessing, and not just some
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.980]   spiritual blessings, but every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:47.340]   Christ. So saving grace is what caused you to be born again and what causes
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:52.780]   your heart to become alive to the knowledge of Christ. Common grace, as
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:58.240]   wonderful as it is, does none of that. Does not bring forgiveness of sins, does
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:05.700]   not bring the knowledge of Christ, does not bring understanding of God's Word. So
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:13.600]   there are limitations here. I have some language on your handout on, if you read
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.060]   Paul Enns, his Moody Handbook of Theology, you'll find that he interchanges, he uses
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:27.180]   the term efficacious grace to describe saving grace, and don't get lost there.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:31.860]   He's referring to the same concept, but using the term efficacious grace, he's
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:39.700]   really highlighting the idea that anyone who receives saving grace does not fail
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:44.140]   to come out of darkness into light. No one receives saving grace and then
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:53.660]   stays an unbeliever. Saving grace is Jesus saying to Lazarus, it's like that
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:58.460]   scene where Jesus said to Lazarus, "Lazarus come forth," and Lazarus came
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.740]   alive. So that's what he's doing when he uses the term efficacious grace, but he's
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.280]   referring to the same category of saving grace. So the first limitation of common
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.860]   grace is common grace does not save. What's a second limitation of common
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:19.180]   grace? And I think this is really important here, letter B. Common grace
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:26.500]   does not overcome sin's effects on the mind. Common grace does not overcome sin's
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:31.820]   effects on the mind. So I'm going to introduce this phrase here, and then
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:37.860]   we'll do some more work on this next Sunday, but the phrase is the noetic
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:44.260]   effects of sin. You'll have, if you read chapter 3 of Heath Lambert's Theology of
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.660]   Biblical Counseling, you'll find he talks a lot about the noetic effects of sin.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:53.620]   What does he mean by that? The term noose comes from the word mind, and so when
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.220]   we're talking about the noetic effects of sin, we're simply talking about sin's
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:07.500]   effects on the mind. Sin has effects on the intellect of the unbeliever. It doesn't
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.820]   remove their intelligence, but what it does is it biases the unbeliever's
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:18.340]   intelligence so that the unbeliever will always argue against God and use his
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.900]   intelligence against God. So unbelievers are intelligent, but they're not
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:31.020]   objective. They're biased against God. The unbeliever is not neutral. You can't just
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:36.060]   hand an unbeliever a list of evidence of why God exists. The unbeliever will look
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:40.380]   at this created universe and the galaxies and the stars and all that God
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:46.060]   has created and conclude that it all came out of a Big Bang and nothing
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:54.420]   created something and order came out of chaos. That's not objective reasoning. It
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:59.780]   may be intelligent reasoning, but it's not objective reasoning. It's very biased,
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:07.500]   and this is what the unbeliever does with his intelligence is he uses it to
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:14.260]   argue against God. Ephesians 4 over 17 is a key passage talking about the noetic
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:20.300]   effects of sin. Paul says, "Now this I say in testifying the Lord that you must no
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:26.620]   longer walk as the Gentiles do in the futility of their minds." Once again, the
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:32.580]   intellectual capacity of an unbeliever does not produce any spiritual fruit.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.460]   There is a futility in their thinking. Paul says they are darkened in their
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.920]   understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.420]   them due to the hardness of heart. Colossians 1 verse 21, "And you who once
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:49.700]   were alienated, hostile in mind." That phrase ascribes me when I was an
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:56.340]   unbeliever. When I first came to church in college, I was hostile in mind. I
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.500]   listened to the pastor sermons and I wrote down copious notes of all the
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.740]   reasons why he was wrong and the Bible was wrong, but because I was a college
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:13.860]   educated person, my notes had good punctuation, good grammar that had
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:21.220]   orderly logical flow to it, but all of that intellectual ability was being used
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:27.180]   to argue against the Bible and to argue against the truth. I was hostile in mind
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:33.580]   and the grace of God was evident in my life and that God saved me and turned
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:40.420]   that hostility into a love for scripture. But common grace cannot overcome the
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:47.540]   noetic effects of sin. So the ACBC Standards of Doctrine, this essay is
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.100]   so important. They have an entire section there. I would encourage you to look that
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:59.460]   up at the ACBC website and they have an entire section on common grace. They
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.340]   write, "The chief manifestation of God's grace is the salvation of sinners by the
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.500]   blood of Jesus Christ. To all who believe, common grace cannot overcome the
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.060]   corrosive effects of sin upon human thinking without the special saving
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:17.780]   grace of Jesus." Continues, "This reality guarantees that though unbelievers can
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.180]   know many facts, they will misunderstand information that is most central to
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.420]   human life, which includes information about God, the human problem, and a
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:30.480]   solution in Christ. Because the central elements of counseling include God, the
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.340]   nature of the human problem, and God's solution in Christ, the counseling
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.660]   methods of secular people are ultimately at odds with a uniquely biblical
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:45.420]   approach to counseling." And so Lambert writes in Theology of Biblical Counseling,
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.460]   "Common grace makes it possible for unbelievers to know facts, but the
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:53.620]   noetic effects of sin make it impossible for them to embrace the most important
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:54:01.680]   facts." So let me show you how this works out in a counseling method. Lambert
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.320]   writes, "The closer unbelievers get in counseling to issues having to do with
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:11.840]   God," so note that really carefully, "The closer unbelievers get in counseling to
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.560]   issues having to do with God, the ultimate meaning of life and the
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.200]   problems that plague humanity, the greater will be the impact of the noetic
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:25.000]   effects of sin on their thinking, and the more cautious Christians must be in
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.520]   accepting the information they produce. The closer you get to the real ultimate
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:36.440]   issues of life, the more the noetic effects of sin are seen. The unbeliever
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:44.040]   gets more hostile toward any discipline that is close to the discipline of
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:52.400]   theology because the unbeliever is hostile in mind." And so let me give you a
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.360]   third limitation here. "Common grace does not enable unbelievers to understand the
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.400]   root of human behavior," which we covered in year one. The root of human behavior
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.080]   is what is going on in the heart. It is out of the heart, the flow of the issues
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.400]   of life. The heart is always relating to God in a worshiping relationship, whether
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:17.200]   that is a disordered worship relationship or whether that is a true
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.280]   worship relationship. The heart is always worshiping something, and that is the
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:27.680]   root of human behavior. So as Lambert writes, and this should be reviewed from
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.560]   year one, there are three levels of psychology. There is observation of
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:39.840]   seeing how men are behaving, what are the words, the actions, the emotions that are
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:46.320]   observable from an external perspective. There is interpretation, which is the
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:52.540]   question, why does man behave in this way? What is the root issue that is giving
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:58.640]   rise to man's behavior? And then once you have interpretation, you have
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.680]   intervention, which seeks to address the issue that is at the root of the problem.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.360]   And Lambert talks about in chapter 3 of Theology of Biblical Counseling that
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.640]   when it comes to observation, a secular psychologist and a biblical counselor
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.960]   will pretty much come up with the same observations. If a person has an anger
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.920]   problem, both a biblical counselor and a secular psychologist will observe that
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:29.480]   his heart rate goes up, his face turns red, he raises his voice, he says certain
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:35.560]   words, and they will pretty much agree under common grace they can make the
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.480]   same observations, whether you're an unbeliever or a believer. I've often said
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:45.920]   that, you know, if someone's designed an experiment of how many people get angry
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:52.440]   when they're on the freeway and there's traffic on the freeway, a secular
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.480]   psychologist and a biblical counselor would pretty much make the same
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:06.120]   observations, that 90% of people who are on a traffic-clogged freeway tend to get
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:12.160]   angry when a temperature reaches a certain number of degrees. Under
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.600]   observation, under common grace, secular psychologists tend to make pretty
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.680]   accurate observations. It's really in the issue of interpretation that the road
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:28.640]   diverges. A secular psychologist cannot make a correct interpretation of that
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:36.040]   external data because they cannot understand who man is, that it is out of
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.680]   the heart that flow the issues of life. The reason why a person is getting
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:47.920]   angry is because he is relating wrongly to the true and the living God, and it is
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.200]   that interpretation that is inevitably flawed under the study of secular
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.160]   psychology, and if, as Lambert writes, if your interpretation is flawed, your
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:07.440]   intervention will be flawed as well. So here's how we would draw this out as an
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.680]   illustration. Here's a person who's behaving a certain way. Let's say the
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:16.820]   issue is anger. Under observation, the question would be how is this person
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:21.240]   behaving? What are the actions and words that are coming out of this person's
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:26.840]   mouth? So I think a secular psychologist and a biblical counselor would make the
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.400]   same observations at this point. They would say that this man is saying a lot
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:42.520]   of bad words, he's saying them very loud, he's agitated in his emotions, he's
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:49.040]   getting sweaty and his face is turning red. Those are some external observations
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.240]   that would probably be the same under a biblical counseling system and also a
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:01.920]   secular psychology system. It's at the level of interpretation that the road
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   diverges. Interpretation asks the question why is this person behaving in
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.600]   this way? Why is he angry? Why is this husband, let's say for example, why is
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:20.360]   this husband being angry with his wife? And secular psychologists cannot answer
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:26.600]   that question because a secular psychologist cannot understand the heart
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.720]   of man, which is spoken of in Scripture. The thoughts, desires, and motivations of
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:37.480]   a man's heart are always relating to God and it is the overflow of that
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:44.340]   relationship to God that expresses itself in observable actions. So it's
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:48.760]   really under interpretation that a biblical counselor and a secular
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:54.120]   psychologist will have a widely divergent interpretation and that's
[00:59:54.120 --> 01:00:01.800]   where the issue needs to be dealt with. Under common grace, we would say that a
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.360]   secular psychologist can make a correct observation under common grace. They can
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.880]   observe behavior, but where common grace is limited is that a secular psychologist
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:18.600]   cannot make a correct interpretation because they don't include the knowledge
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.200]   of God in their system of thought. I hope that makes sense to you. So under
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:31.120]   secular psychologists, the intervention will be out in the realm of actions and
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.800]   words, a lot of behavior modification. The secular psychologist will go to the
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.320]   angry person and say here's some tips and techniques to manage your anger, you
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.520]   know, here's a ball to squeeze if you get upset, here's, you know,
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.680]   learn to count to ten or, you know, things that give that modified behavior but
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.240]   don't deal with the heart issue. The biblical counseling model intervention
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.040]   is in the heart. Hebrews 4 verse 12. We're after the thoughts and the intentions of
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.880]   the heart and we have only one tool to get there and that is the Word of God
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.080]   because only the Word of God can discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:20.920]   So I hope that that makes sense to you of where the differences are. Okay,
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.560]   let me let me end with this and I'm gonna run a little bit over time here,
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.360]   but I think this will be helpful and set us up for next week. So I put in your
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:40.760]   Dropbox folder George Sipioni's articles called Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe and it's an
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.200]   excellent article. I encourage you to read it all, but if you don't read all of
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:52.520]   it, the gold is really in footnote 24 and so search through the entire essay and
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.640]   get down to footnote 24 and he gives probably the best illustration I've come
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:05.720]   across as to how the noetic effects of sin increase the closer you get to the
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.480]   knowledge of God. And he has this diagram. You have these disciplines of
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.000]   knowledge. You have math, physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.800]   sociology, psychology, and theology. And basically his point in footnote 24 is to
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:31.120]   say that if you are left on this diagram, you have a lesser amount of the noetic
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.960]   effects of sin because the discipline is not as close to the study of God as some
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.660]   other disciplines. The more right you go on the diagram, the more you will see the
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:50.560]   noetic effects of sin on the unbelievers mind because you are getting closer to
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.680]   the study of the knowledge of God. So the more right you go, the more you see the
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.200]   hostility of the unbelievers mind manifesting itself in that realm of
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:09.440]   study. So I'll quote Scipione here. He says, "As we go from left to right, we move
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.200]   from the abstract non-personal to the concrete personal aspects of the
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.520]   universe. As we move to the right, the noetic effects of sin is multiplied at
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.320]   an escalating pace, distorting the observation of data and the conclusions
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.440]   drawn from that data. The distortion grows as we move right until we find
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.880]   clearly rival theologies that openly, self-consciously reject the true and the
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:45.400]   living God." And so here is the issue as it relates to the counseling discussion.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:53.120]   You will find the most distortion of the noetic effects of sin in the study
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.600]   of psychology, the study of man. Why is that? Because Genesis 1 verse 27 says
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:05.720]   that man is made in the image of God. The more right you go, the closer you are
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.120]   getting to the study of God. And when you get to the study of man, you are as close
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:17.920]   to the study of God as you can be because man is made to reflect God's
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.520]   likeness and he's made to live in relationship with God. So you are gonna
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:30.960]   see the most distortion, the greatest effect of sin's effects upon the mind in
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.320]   the study of psychology because you are as close as you can get to the study of
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:45.960]   theology. So back to the question. With all that said, how do you write this
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.480]   essay? Explain the doctrine of common grace relating the doctrine to the
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.640]   ability of psycho-psychologists to understand true information about the
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:05:01.680]   human condition. Well, first you need to explain common grace. Just start off with
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.960]   what is grace and then give the categories of common grace versus saving
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:13.200]   grace. Draw the distinctions between common grace and saving grace and just
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.480]   give verses and good quotes from established theologians that explain the
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:25.680]   doctrine of common grace. The second part of the essay is you need to explain how
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.800]   does this relate to the ability of secular psychologists to understand true
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:35.320]   information about the human condition. Under that basic framework of Lambert
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:42.480]   gives you under observation, interpretation, and intervention. We
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:49.040]   would expect the secular psychologists to be able to make some true observations
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:55.360]   about human behavior under common grace because the psychologist, the
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.960]   psycho-psychologist has intellectual ability. We would not discount the fact
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:09.000]   that those observations may be accurate. The issue comes, as I mentioned, under
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.440]   interpretation. A secular psychologist is not able to accurately interpret that
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   data and understand the true condition of man. A secular psychologist can't
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.680]   understand the root of the issue, which is the heart. A secular psychologist
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:30.920]   can't relate to that data of observable information to how a person is relating
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.880]   to the true and the living God. Therefore, a secular psychologist cannot
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:44.000]   give the proper intervention to deal with the heart issues because he does
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.760]   not understand the interpretation of the data. Under the second part of this
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.840]   essay, you want to work through Lambert's categories of observation,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:02.360]   interpretation, and intervention. I think the basic framework is that common
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.800]   grace allows a secular psychologist to make accurate observations, but the
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.320]   limitations of common grace keep the secular psychologist from making
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:18.440]   accurate interpretations. Therefore, the interventions are flawed. That
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.280]   leads us to just embrace the fact that as biblical counselors, we minister under
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.240]   saving grace. We minister saving grace. We want our
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.920]   counselees to be saved, first of all. We don't want to just modify their behavior.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.840]   We want them to come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and then we
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.760]   want our counselees to experience that grace of God, which conforms them into
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:51.080]   the likeness of Christ and makes them more and more holy. So a lot there, but I
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.640]   hope that's helpful, and this is a real crucial issue as it relates to your
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:01.960]   essays and to biblical counseling. Okay, what I'm gonna do, I've gone over time, so
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.160]   I'm gonna pray for us, and you can be dismissed and enjoy a nice Father's Day.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.420]   I'll hang on for five or ten minutes if any of you have questions on the
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.280]   material or in any of the essays, but you're free to go if that's
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.760]   sufficient, and let me pray for us and close our time. Father, thank you for
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:25.840]   your amazing grace, both common grace and saving grace, all of the expressions of
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.240]   your grace. We just praise you and thank you that you are a gracious Heavenly
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:37.640]   Father. Thank you that under saving grace, we have the ability not only to observe
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.160]   how people behave, but we can diagnose the true condition of the heart through
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.240]   your word, and so we pray that you would help us and make us into effective
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.280]   biblical counselors who minister to the thoughts and intentions of the heart
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.360]   using your word, and we trust in the sufficiency of your word for life
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.000]   change. Thank you for each student here. Thank you for their dedication to this
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.560]   training. May you bless it. May you give it much fruit. May this be a clarifying
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:12.360]   process for each one, and help us to dig deep into your word that we may be
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.000]   useful to you and be able to minister your word to others, and we just thank
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.200]   you and praise you in Jesus' name, amen. Okay, amen. You are dismissed, but I'll
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.400]   hang on for five, ten minutes. If any of you have any questions, I'll be happy to
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:31.720]   answer them, or we can also be free to go. Okay, Lord bless you.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   [silence]
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   [silence]
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:10:03.720]   [silence]
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.760]   Okay, question is, do we need to retype the questions at the beginning of each
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:15.540]   essay? Essays are kind of long, and this would help me save space. So, a great
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:21.840]   question. We would want you to use the template at biblicalcounseling.com,
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:30.240]   and I believe the template has all of the questions listed at the top, so yes,
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.480]   the questions should be at the top of each essay if you follow the template. I
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.160]   don't know if ACBC is going to be super strict on that, but that is kind of the
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   template that they've given us, is to put each question at the top. So, it's a good
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.400]   question. I'm encouraged to hear that you have more material that you need to cut
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.800]   down rather than less material, but that's good news. So, editing is always,
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:03.880]   it's always a difficult thing. So, may God bless you as you seek to edit
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   your essays down to a page and a half.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:13.120]   Question is, do you ever go through common grace and saving grace to lead to
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:20.080]   sharing the gospel to a counselee you think is unsaved? That's a great
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.080]   question. I think common grace is, it's very fair to go to explain common grace
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:33.680]   to a counselee because it's part of the inspired Word of God, and I think it
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:41.000]   illustrates God's holiness, His justice, His wrath, all of those concepts are
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.880]   directly relevant to the unbeliever. As always, you would want to move from
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   common grace to saving grace to the person and work of Jesus Christ, and make
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.600]   sure that is the focus of sharing the gospel, but absolutely, you can use common
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.600]   grace to minister to a counselee because it's part of God's truth, but always
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.920]   keeping in mind that a person is saved when they come to place their trust
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:16.120]   in the person and work of Jesus Christ and His full atonement on the cross for
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.080]   their sins, so make sure you get from common grace to saving grace in your
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.360]   presentation of the gospel, but great question.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:37.160]   All right, wonderful. Okay, well, Lord bless you all. If there's not any more
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.000]   questions, I'm gonna sign off, and I think I'm gonna go to Father's Day, some kind
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.400]   of Father's Day celebration. We'll see what my kids want to do.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.520]   One more question is, "Can you expand on your counseling example you gave at the
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.200]   beginning about reconciling between spouses and parent, kids, and church
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:06.680]   members?" Yeah, I just think the goal--great question, Steve--and I just think the goal
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:14.000]   of counseling, when you're doing a marriage issue, for example, is you want
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.080]   to help the person to become more like Christ, and becoming more like Christ
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:26.120]   means not loving your wife when she is respectful to you, but loving your wife
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   when she is disrespectful to you, or, you know, vice versa. For the wife, it's
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.440]   loving your husband when he leads you well and loves you well, or loving him
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.400]   when he's selfish and aloof and doesn't seem to care. Becoming like Christ is
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.640]   learning to love your enemies. That's how Christ loved us. Christ loved us when we
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.000]   were his enemies. He died for us, and I just think that that's the powerful
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.440]   truth that biblical counseling offers that no other counseling system can
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.320]   ever offer. No other counseling system can offer a
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.360]   counselee the hope of becoming more like Christ. I mean, you can do behavior
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.280]   modification, you can do some tips and techniques to put a band-aid on the
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.880]   marriage, but you can't offer the hope of becoming more like Christ, and that's
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.640]   where our counseling method differs from the secular method, because a
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:27.320]   biblical counselor will tell the husband that your wife does not need to change
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.000]   for you to become more like Christ. You can become more like Christ today,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.320]   regardless of how your wife behaves or doesn't behave toward you, because being
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.720]   like Christ is loving those who are disrespectful and those who don't love
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.600]   you in response. So that's my criticism of Gary Chapman's "Five Love Languages." My
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.040]   critique of that, I did that in year one, is that book is basically holding out a
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:01.200]   model of love others so that they will love you. Learn your spouse's love
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.000]   language so that your spouse will learn your love language, and a biblical
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.320]   counseling approach is much deeper than that. You need to love your spouse,
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.240]   and you do so for the glory of Christ, and because it makes you more like
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:21.920]   Christ, not so that you will expect something in return, and that's just a
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.880]   whole different issue. When a husband gets a hold of the idea
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.840]   that he is to be like Christ regardless of how his wife behaves toward him,
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.320]   that's a powerful life-changing element that brings hope and help into the
