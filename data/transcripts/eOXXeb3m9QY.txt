[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   - Well, if you recall from our last session together,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.300]   we talked a lot about how every man is a leader.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.480]   And that assignment started at creation
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.780]   in the Garden of Eden before sin entered the world.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.860]   The privilege and responsibility of male leadership
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.040]   was not the curse.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.900]   It was a key feature of God's perfect creation.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.720]   Man was created to lead,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.640]   to exercise dominion and authority.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.600]   Satan's first and successful attack
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.260]   was against that authority.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.660]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.540]   Today's chaos surrounding the concepts
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.820]   and the principles of male authority and leadership
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820]   is a continuation of Satan's efforts
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.480]   that began in the Garden of Eden.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   The resulting confusion and rebellion
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.420]   against God's design results in either really bad leadership
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.500]   or none at all,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.100]   with all of the consequences that come from that.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.180]   Secular leadership, we learned last time,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.620]   is vastly different than spiritual leadership.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.280]   We spent a fair amount of time in our last session
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.420]   contrasting secular leadership and spiritual leadership,
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.160]   and you may recall, even as we looked at
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.700]   the transformation of the Apostle Paul
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.500]   and the leadership transformation that he went through
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.160]   as a result of the gospel.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.500]   Well, tonight, we address the reality
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.600]   that with leadership comes authority.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500]   The definition of authority in Webster's dictionary
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.820]   is the power to influence, to command authority,
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.360]   command thought, opinion, or behavior.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.820]   Authority and power go together.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.180]   Webster says so.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780]   Your experience confirms that,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.580]   and the Bible says so also.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.460]   Back in Genesis 1, God described the authority and power
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.320]   that he gave to human beings as he was creating them.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.260]   Genesis 1, 27 and 28 says God created man in his own image.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.480]   In the image of God, he created him.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.240]   Male and female, he created them.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.100]   God blessed them, and God said to them,
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.780]   be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth,
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.160]   and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.520]   and over the birds of the sky,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.420]   and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.800]   You're very familiar with those verses.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.860]   In those verses, God establishes authority and dominion.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.740]   That words subdue and rule speaks of the use of force.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.520]   It means domination, bringing into bondage,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.400]   to bring under dominion.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.600]   And here's God's plan laid out in verses 27 and 28.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.160]   One, he created you, he rules the world.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.280]   And then it goes on to say that God's perfect design
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.880]   for you and I was to get married,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.240]   have babies, grandbabies,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.340]   enjoy the bounty of the earth,
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.500]   and to rule over the earth,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.340]   the fish, the birds, and every living thing
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.700]   that crawls on the earth,
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.580]   with full authority from the creator.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.180]   Satan's plan, as evidenced by our current culture,
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.220]   is don't get married.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.760]   But if you do get married, don't have babies.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.780]   And if you do have babies, don't have very many,
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.880]   'cause we're gonna overpopulate the earth, don't you know?
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.760]   And you need to be a vegetarian,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.720]   because animals are people too.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.520]   Don't enjoy the bounty of the earth,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.960]   don't exercise dominion and authority over the earth,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.620]   rather celebrate Earth Day.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.960]   Worship the creation over the creator.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.160]   Why is this Satan's plan?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   Well, it may not be his plan,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.000]   but here's the consequence.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.560]   When we do not faithfully lead
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   and rule where we have been told to lead and rule,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.060]   Satan steps in and takes the lead.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.980]   That's what happened with Adam and Eve in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.040]   We saw that in our last time together.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.920]   Adam stepped back, handed over the leadership
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   and the authority over his wife to the serpents.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.320]   That in itself was sin.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.400]   And it resulted in sin,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.000]   because Eve, being deceived, went on to sin.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   The result of weak or absent leadership is sin.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.520]   Forfeiting authority that God has given you is sin,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.040]   and it's sin that harms people
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.440]   that have been entrusted to your leadership.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.000]   This should lead all of us to a question.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.200]   What is the authority that comes with leadership,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.600]   and where do I find the answer to that question?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.460]   The question of authority wielded by leadership
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.400]   is foundational, and it's extremely important.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.760]   Some men aspire to leadership because of authority.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.820]   They want that authority.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.040]   They may not know what the authority or the power is,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.180]   but they want it.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.980]   This thinking tends to lead to overstepping authority,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.800]   overstepping the God-given bounds
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.880]   and the limits on authority.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   Some men don't aspire to leadership
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.720]   because either they don't want to,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.400]   they don't want to do the work required,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.880]   or they're focused on their own failings and weaknesses.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.280]   This is often a false humility that masks fear and pride.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.440]   These are the men that say, and believe, I'm not a leader.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.960]   They tend not to exercise authority,
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.920]   and in their disobedience, their people suffer.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.760]   In fact, men who do not lead is the classic formula
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.360]   for messed up homes, churches, and societies.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.760]   Then there's men who, because of strong natural abilities
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   or being in the right place at the right time,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.160]   find themselves in positions of leadership,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.120]   and they've never really thought about
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.160]   what is the authority that I should be exercising
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.680]   or should not be exercising.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   They just follow the example of others.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   Well, my prayer is that in tonight's session,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.840]   you're reminded of the call on your life to lead,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.760]   and in the exercise of that leadership,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.860]   you've been given authority,
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.120]   and that authority must be understood
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.400]   and very carefully applied.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.800]   This is an area of obedience in every way
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.380]   like any other clear command in Scripture.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.160]   We need to explore what the Bible says about authority,
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.840]   and I think you're gonna leave here
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.560]   with some really clear direction and principles.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.560]   How a man views authority
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.200]   in the context of his leadership says a lot
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.960]   about whether that man is an effective leader
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.480]   and to take it a step further,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.600]   whether he's qualified for more leadership.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.080]   An example of that is in 1 Timothy 3.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.600]   Paul is describing the qualifications
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.060]   of leaders in the church, elders, pastors.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.180]   And he says this, "He must, the elder or pastor,
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.640]   "must be one who manages his own household well,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.200]   "keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.020]   "But if a man does not know how to manage his own household,
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.360]   "how will he take care of the church of God?"
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.420]   There's two principles there related to authority.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.720]   There's a lot of principles there,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   and we'll be coming back to these verses in future sessions,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.260]   but when we're talking about authority,
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.960]   there's two things to note here.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.300]   One is the authority of a husband and a father
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.620]   is different than the authority of an elder in the church.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.580]   A man who serves as an elder
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.040]   exercises different authority as an elder
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.100]   than he exercises as a father and a husband.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.580]   The family, the church, the state, or government,
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.700]   have very different purposes,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.020]   and therefore, the authority delegated to the leadership
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.820]   of those three institutions is very different.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.180]   You see some of that difference in those terms.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.780]   He manages his household well,
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.460]   and he cares for the church of God.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.220]   We'll come back to that in another session.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.900]   The second principle related to authority in those verses
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.100]   that's very interesting is that the demonstrated exercise
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.820]   and proven understanding of his authority in the home
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.140]   is a must.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.700]   You see that, right?
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.740]   He must.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.700]   That is a must before a man can be appointed an elder
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.820]   or other leadership in the church.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.020]   So note, it doesn't say to look at his success
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.740]   or strength of leadership at work.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.820]   That's not in the Bible,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.140]   and it shouldn't be in our thinking.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.180]   Paul points to the home as evidence
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.220]   and a predictor of whether a man understands
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.300]   and faithfully exercises the God-given authority.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:48.820]   Men in leadership always should want to know
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.140]   what their authority is.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.780]   A biblical leader wants to be very careful
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.260]   to be obedient in his leadership
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.820]   and never overstep or understep the authority
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.260]   that's been delegated to him.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.060]   A secular leader wants to push the limits of authority
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.140]   to assume more power and control.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.860]   In fact, in a secular environment,
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.500]   the successful secular leaders
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.580]   are those who amass the most power.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.140]   We're seeing that in our country right now.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   Successful spiritual leaders, though,
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.980]   and that's who I'm talking to,
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.620]   are those who faithfully and carefully exert
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.620]   the authority that's been given to them by God
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.020]   no more and no less.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.260]   We must start with a very big picture,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.940]   and I want to go through a survey now of Scripture
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:53.580]   to look at the authority of God as a starting place,
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.420]   and then we'll bring it down
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.140]   to a very practical implications for you and I
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.860]   as we establish the question, or the answer to the question,
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.700]   what is my authority as a husband, as a father,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.260]   as a leader in the church, or anywhere else?
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.820]   A survey of authority in the Bible, I think,
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.620]   brings a lot of clarity for us.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.620]   So first, God is God, and we are not.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.380]   In Genesis chapter two, God establishes,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.620]   just like he did in Genesis one, his authority.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.180]   Genesis 2-7, we looked at this already.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.500]   Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.900]   and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.780]   and man became a living being.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.220]   What you create, you control.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.700]   What you create, you have all authority over.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.980]   Right?
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.260]   Later in the Old Testament, in Isaiah 40,
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.220]   one of my favorite chapters in all of the Bible,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.300]   it says this, starting in verse 21.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.100]   This is a description of the Creator's total authority.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.900]   Do you not know?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.980]   Have you not heard?
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.420]   Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.780]   Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.620]   Let me stop.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.780]   There's a series of questions there.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.360]   Isaiah does this a lot in chapter 40.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.660]   The answer to all these questions is yes,
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.300]   so you could read it this way.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.140]   You know, you've heard.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.300]   It's been declared to you from the beginning.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.020]   We saw that in Genesis one, Genesis two, Genesis three.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.820]   You've understood from the foundations of the earth, what?
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.700]   Verse 22, that it is God who sits
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.860]   above the circle of the earth,
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.380]   and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.060]   What a contrast.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.820]   I see grasshoppers.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.980]   God sits above the circle of the earth,
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.860]   and it says he stretches the heavens like a curtain,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.780]   and he spreads them out like a tent to live in,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.460]   and now he addresses his relationship
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.140]   to authority on this earth.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.820]   It is God who reduces rulers to nothing,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.780]   who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.440]   Scarcely have they been planted.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.580]   Scarcely have they been sown.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.460]   Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth,
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.580]   but he merrily blows on them, and they wither,
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.540]   and the storm carries them away like stubble.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.500]   To whom then will you compare me
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.700]   that I would be as equal, says the Holy One.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.980]   And then, Christ, God sends his son,
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.300]   Jesus Christ, to the earth to live a perfect life,
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.260]   fully God, fully man.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.300]   He's crucified, he's murdered by his own creation.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.260]   For our sake, for our redemption,
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.620]   he raises from the dead on the third day,
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.460]   and he's about to give the great commission
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.740]   to his disciples, and he starts with this statement
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.220]   in verse 18, and Jesus came up and spoke to them,
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.380]   saying, "All authority has been given to me
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.500]   "in heaven and on earth."
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.060]   All means all.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.140]   Christ has all authority.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.980]   In fact, Paul references that in Ephesians one,
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.140]   as we continue our survey of the Bible
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.220]   on the topic of the authority of God,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.340]   Paul says in verse 20 that God raised Jesus Christ
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.460]   from the dead, seated him at his right hand
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.700]   in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.780]   and power and dominion, and every name that is named,
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.260]   not only in this age, but in the one to come.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.940]   God is far above Jesus Christ, is far above all authority.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.780]   He's not far away.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.060]   We're gonna see that.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   He's far above, but he's not far away.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.300]   He's not disconnected.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.860]   God is God, and we are not.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.380]   God is authority.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.860]   Christ has been given all authority.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.420]   He has authority and dominion over everything,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.220]   including the state, the church,
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.620]   the family, and even Satan.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.500]   That is the starting point for understanding authority.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.860]   He never steps aside from his authority.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.380]   He never diminishes his power and authority ever,
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.980]   but he does delegate earthly leadership and authority.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.160]   That's where you and I enter the equation.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:41.820]   We already saw the rule and dominion over the earth,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.900]   fish, animals, everything that lives on the earth
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.180]   was assigned during the seven-day creation.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.180]   We read that in Genesis 1.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.020]   But what about authority over people?
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:57.220]   Through institutions that God has ordained,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.660]   that authority has also been delegated.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.540]   God delegates authority.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.620]   In Genesis 2, we saw last time that authority
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.780]   over the family has been delegated to you,
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.540]   men, husbands, fathers.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.100]   You were created by God as a man to be a leader.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.100]   Your leadership was a divine act and a divine assignment.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.780]   It wasn't by chance, and it has your name on it.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.020]   God delegates authority.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.260]   In the church, Acts 20, Paul's talking to the elders
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.580]   in the church at Ephesus, and he says,
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.020]   "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.460]   "among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.780]   God delegates authority through Christ
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.580]   to elders and pastors.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.580]   And then there's Romans 13.1.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.540]   I know you're familiar with this.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.780]   There is no authority except from God,
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.820]   and those which exist are established by God.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.180]   It could not be more clear.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.740]   And I love that this was read already tonight,
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.660]   but Christ is on trial in John chapter 19,
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.140]   and I don't want you to miss this,
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.820]   so I'm going to read it again.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.540]   Christ is on trial by his own creation.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.420]   Pilate has left the room, and it says in verse nine
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.220]   of John 19 that he enters back into the Praetorium again
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.220]   and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?"
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.180]   And Jesus gave him no answer.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.980]   So Pilate says to him, "You don't speak to me?
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.660]   "You don't speak to me?
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.220]   "Do you not know I have the authority to release you
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.860]   "and I have the authority to crucify you?"
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.860]   And you heard Christ's response.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.420]   Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over me
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.780]   "unless it had been given you from above."
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.740]   God is sovereign over all authority.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.020]   Never forget that.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.500]   And he in his perfect will and his perfect providence
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   delegates all authority, including to Pilate.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.920]   The dominion and rule of Christ even includes Satan.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.860]   The Bible establishes in Ephesians 2,
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.500]   among other places in the Bible,
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.340]   that Satan has been given authority.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.780]   He's called in Ephesians 2 the prince of the power
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.420]   of the air and the spirit that is now working
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   in the sons of disobedience here on earth.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.220]   He does so at the pleasure of
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.060]   and accountability to Jesus Christ.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:51.620]   If you're familiar with the story in Job 1 and chapter 2,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.340]   Satan actually enters the presence of God in heaven,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.080]   in the courts of heaven, and asks for authority
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.660]   to test and to try Job.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.660]   That authority was granted with limits, with limits,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.100]   and you might know the rest of that story.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.460]   If you've never read that story,
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.900]   read Job chapter 1 and Job chapter 2.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.580]   So let's review.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.100]   God is the creator and the supreme authority.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.940]   He's given all authority to Christ,
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.620]   who sits at the right hand of the Father.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.500]   Christ, while still and always being above all authority
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.700]   and the head of all, has delegated authority
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.680]   and leadership on this earth to men.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.140]   That means if you have any authority at all,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.300]   it was given to you.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.660]   And not just given to you, but it was given to you
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.780]   by the ruler over all authority.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.420]   And what's been given to you can also be taken away.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.820]   And we need to talk about that.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.500]   Authority is given by God, and it's taken away by God.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.860]   And we have to think about that,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.340]   because there's a lot of reasons why God removes authority
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.660]   from leaders, or removes leaders.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.420]   There's oppressive leadership.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.540]   There's ungodly and disobedient leadership.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.480]   There's absent leadership,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.180]   not using your God-given authority.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.220]   And there's so many examples in the Bible,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.500]   but I went to one of the more dramatic.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.560]   Numbers chapter 25.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.940]   I'm gonna read from about verse two, or verse one.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.900]   "The people began to play the harlot
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.860]   "with the daughters of Moab, for they invited the people
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.860]   "to the sacrifices of their gods.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.260]   "And the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.780]   "So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor,
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.060]   "and the Lord was angry against Israel."
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.700]   This is a mess, isn't it?
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   Verse four, "The Lord said to Moses, 'Kill all the people.'"
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.300]   That's not what it says.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:09.720]   "The Lord said to Moses, 'Take all the leaders of the people,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.860]   "and execute them in broad daylight before the Lord,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.240]   "so that the fierce anger of the Lord
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.140]   "may turn away from Israel.'
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.280]   "So Moses said to the judges of Israel,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.300]   "Each of you slay as men who have joined themselves
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.680]   "to Baal of Peor.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.060]   "The leaders didn't lead with the authority
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.440]   "they were given.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.000]   "The result was sin.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.680]   "The people sinned.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.800]   "And there may have been consequences for the people,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.260]   "but God had held the leadership accountable
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.120]   "in a very public way."
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.080]   You see, what God gives, he takes away.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.300]   Daniel chapters one through four,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.180]   the story of Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.880]   Nebuchadnezzar was perhaps the wealthiest,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.420]   most powerful political leader,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.260]   maybe in the history of the world.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.980]   He held the power of life and death
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.760]   simply by the words he spoke.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.240]   He used that power and authority to build enormous,
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.020]   almost unimaginable wealth and more power.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.540]   And God removed him from leadership.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:22.200]   Daniel 4.32 says, "You will be driven away from mankind.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.900]   "Your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field."
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.060]   He's talking to the most powerful ruler
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.100]   on the face of the earth.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.760]   You'll live with the beasts of the field,
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.220]   you'll be given grass to eat like cattle,
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.440]   and seven years will pass over you until you recognize,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.560]   why is God doing this to Nebuchadnezzar?
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.240]   Because he wants him, it says,
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.040]   to recognize that the most high is ruler
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.880]   over the realm of mankind and bestows it
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.900]   on whomever he wishes.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.340]   God gives authority and he takes it away.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.300]   And by the way, it happened to Nebuchadnezzar
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.500]   and after seven years,
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.340]   Nebuchadnezzar was actually restored to leadership.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.780]   Who can do that other than God?
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:15.820]   The Lord does both as he wishes and if he wishes.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.460]   Daniel 1 through 4 is not primarily about Daniel
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.260]   and it's not primarily about Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.120]   It's about the power and the authority
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.980]   and the providence of God in the affairs of man,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.900]   particularly men in leadership
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.580]   with significant authority and their accountability
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.760]   to the one who gave them that authority.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.720]   I mentioned that Christ even has authority over Satan.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.060]   In Revelation 12, now we're looking to the future.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.100]   Revelation 12 describes when Satan is thrown out of heaven.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.180]   I've already established from Job 1 and 2
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.960]   that he is in heaven making requests of God.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.260]   It says in Revelation 12 verse 9,
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.380]   the great dragon was thrown down,
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.860]   the serpent of old who's called the devil and Satan.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.860]   There's three descriptions of Satan.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.500]   Helps you interpret Old Testament
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.700]   to know when it's talking about the devil,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.260]   the great dragon, the serpent of old,
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.220]   the devil and Satan who deceives the whole world.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.700]   He was thrown down to the earth
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.000]   and his angels were thrown down with him.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.700]   Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.380]   now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.660]   and the authority of his Christ have come.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.380]   God allows authority, he takes it away.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.500]   And to further emphasize Christ's total control of Satan
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.780]   and his authority.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.460]   Later in Revelation 20, again, this is eschatology.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.420]   This is what's going to happen in the future.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.900]   The description is that Christ lays hold of the dragon,
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.260]   the serpent of old who is the devil and Satan, same person.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.300]   And bound him for a thousand years
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.700]   and he threw him into the abyss
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.180]   and shut it and sealed it over him
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.100]   so that he would not deceive the nations any longer
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.180]   until the thousand years were completed.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.980]   And after these things, he was released,
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.000]   will be released for a short time.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.460]   There is a thousand years when Satan is put away.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:33.340]   And then later in Revelation 20,
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.260]   it says that Satan is released from his prison
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.740]   to deceive the nations one more time
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.460]   only to be finally utterly conquered by Christ.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.820]   And then it says he's thrown into the lake of fire
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.500]   and brimstone forever.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.740]   That is the power and the authority of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.900]   He allows Satan to have authority, he removes it,
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.780]   he gives it back and then he takes it away.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   If you struggle, by the way, with believing that
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.980]   about Christ having total control over Satan,
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.460]   please understand that Satan doesn't have a hard time
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.700]   believing that.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.400]   In fact, James 2:19 says that he and his demons
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.180]   know all of this and they shudder.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.260]   So I've spent some time tonight
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.580]   displaying the ultimate authority of God
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.980]   through some history, some biography,
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.800]   and even looking to the future.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.940]   Because we must understand that the giver of authority,
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.620]   we must understand the giver of authority
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.000]   before we consider any authority we might have been given.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.460]   Thus, we approach what's ahead of us tonight
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.460]   with a discussion about authority and power on this earth
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:00.260]   with tremendous humility, I pray, and accountability.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.860]   So how do you fit into this?
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.220]   Let's drill down now into a very practical application
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.740]   of all of this and as with everything else,
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.900]   God doesn't just say you're in charge.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.420]   He describes his expectation.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.380]   If you've got your handout,
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.460]   we're gonna work through the grid that's on,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.540]   I think on the front page there.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.140]   And we're gonna fill this grid in
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.180]   and I think it's gonna be helpful to you.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.380]   What's on the screen is what goes in that first column
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.180]   if you're taking notes.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.740]   If you don't have a handout, they're out there somewhere.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.340]   I really want you to fill this in.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.180]   I wanna show you a pattern in Scripture
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.180]   that once you see it, as they say, you can never unsee it.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.920]   When the Bible talks about authority over people,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.540]   it says seven things every time.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.180]   It tells us seven things about that authority.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.740]   First, it tells us that all authority is delegated by God.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.020]   The Bible always defines the authority.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.020]   The Bible always answers the question,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.460]   what is my authority?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:30.900]   The Bible always discloses what the focus
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.640]   and the purpose of that authority is.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.520]   The Bible always limits that authority
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.780]   and describes the limits on that authority.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:49.080]   Fifth, there is always the warning and the command
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.600]   that that authority is to be exercised
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   in accordance with God's word, with God's instructions.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.160]   Sixth, authority over other people is never,
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.600]   catch that, never for personal gain.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.920]   And the flip side of that is that delegated authority
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   is always, always for the benefit of others.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.360]   So that's kind of giving you the bottom line
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.560]   before I show you, and now I wanna show you
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.640]   from two passages.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.680]   We're gonna look at Matthew chapter 10.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.520]   And again, I think once you see this,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.620]   it will fall right into place for you.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.340]   Matthew chapter 10.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.820]   Don't have to give a lot of background
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.860]   because it tells the story.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.940]   Jesus summoned his 12 disciples and gave them what?
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.980]   He's about to delegate authority.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.660]   Authority is always delegated from God.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.920]   That's the source of the authority.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.540]   Jesus summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.300]   And what is the authority?
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.900]   He gave them authority over unclean spirits
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.020]   to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.300]   and every kind of sickness.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.380]   That's extraordinary power.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.980]   That's extraordinary authority.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.460]   It goes on in Matthew to name all 12 of the disciples.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.660]   Verse five, these 12 Jesus sent out after instructing them,
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.380]   do not go in the way of the Gentiles
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.600]   and do not enter any city of the Samaritans,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.680]   but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.260]   And as you go, preach saying,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.500]   the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.300]   And here's another recitation of the authority.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.180]   Heal the sick, raise the dead,
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.860]   cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.260]   Freely you received, freely give.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.940]   Do not acquire gold or silver or copper for your money belts
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.580]   or a bag for your journey or even two coats or sandals
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.440]   or a staff for the worker is worthy of his support.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:10.620]   In that passage are all seven elements of authority.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.180]   We saw it in verse one, authority is delegated from God.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.260]   We saw what the authority is.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.140]   It answers the question, what was their authority?
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.260]   The third question is, what was the purpose of the authority?
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.880]   Well, the purpose of the authority is in verse seven.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:34.220]   As you go, preach saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.420]   What does that have to do with the authority?
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.260]   It always goes together.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.380]   The purpose of the authority explains what the authority is
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.980]   and the authority that's given explains the purpose.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.360]   They were to preach that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.420]   They were to show through their authority
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.300]   what they were talking about.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.380]   People think in terms of earthly kingdoms.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.460]   They're to preach about Christ's kingdom
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.980]   and they're to show them through this authority
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.400]   that Christ's kingdom, unlike any earthly kingdom,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.500]   is sovereign over physical realms, sickness,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.720]   spiritual realms, the effects of sin,
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.780]   and even the efforts in the reign of Satan.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.940]   Their preaching was to preview the future.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.620]   What I read you from Revelation 20,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.500]   that Christ has authority over Satan.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.260]   That was the purpose of the authority.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.580]   The authority was limited.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.420]   The authority was limited.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:44.420]   You see it by who was sent and who they were sent to.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.940]   And by the way, Matthew 10 is a proof text
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.740]   for a lot of faith healers these days.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.460]   They're completely missing the point of Matthew 10.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.380]   Matthew 10 could not be more explicit
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.700]   on the limitations of this authority
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.880]   that Christ authorized how many people?
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.220]   12, even named them.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:11.180]   That's the limits on that authority.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.480]   That's to whom the authority was given.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.940]   Who were they to go to?
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.360]   Well, it says in verse five,
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.600]   Jesus sent the 12 out after instructing them,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.200]   don't go to the Gentiles, don't go to the Samaritans,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.100]   but go to who?
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.160]   The Jews.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.480]   He calls them the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.920]   That is the limit on their authority.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.240]   Authority's always based on the word of God.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.680]   You know, if you walk around culture raising the dead,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.580]   healing the sick, doing all these things,
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.520]   people are gonna ask you to weigh in
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.680]   on all kinds of things
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.820]   because you've got power nobody else has.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.880]   Christ was very clear.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   As you go, preach, preach, preach.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   Not politics, preferences, or personal opinions,
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.000]   but they were to speak the word of God.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.560]   And then the tail end of Matthew 10,
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.380]   that passage you see the principle
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.560]   that authority is never for financial
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.600]   or other earthly personal gain
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.060]   of those who have the authority.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.560]   It is for the benefit and blessing of others.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.920]   He says, freely you received, freely give.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.260]   And he makes very clear
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.480]   that they were not to put this authority up for sale.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.000]   Let's look at another example.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.140]   Romans 13.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.780]   We already read Romans 13, one,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.420]   that all authority is from God.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.380]   And again, we're gonna go through this pretty quickly
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.220]   so you can fill in this grid,
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.220]   and you can see that God delegates authority,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.380]   that he explains his authority.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.060]   He defines it.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.420]   He explains the purpose of that authority.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.100]   He limits the authority.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.020]   He makes clear that it is to be used
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.340]   in accordance with the Bible
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.520]   and it is never for personal gain,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.620]   always for the benefit of others.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.640]   Romans 13, I'm gonna start reading in verse three.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.700]   For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.880]   but for evil.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.540]   Rulers, we're talking about government authorities.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.420]   Whether you call 'em kings, presidents, governors, mayors,
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.760]   whatever they are.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.860]   They've all been delegated by God,
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   and they are not a cause of fear for good behavior,
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.220]   but for evil.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.860]   Do you wanna have no fear of authority?
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.540]   Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.060]   For it is a minister of God to you for good,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.740]   but if you do what is evil, be afraid.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.940]   For it does not bear the sword for nothing.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.460]   It is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.620]   on the one who practices evil.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.900]   Therefore, it is necessary to be in subjection,
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.580]   not only because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.780]   For because of this, you also pay taxes
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.860]   for rulers or servants of God,
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.100]   devoting themselves to this very thing.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.060]   There's two authorities given to government there,
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:16.900]   by the way.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.320]   One is the sword, and the other is taxes.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.420]   We're not gonna talk about taxes tonight.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.820]   But it's very clear.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.080]   You know, in a parallel passage, or principles,
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.080]   Peter's letter, 1 Peter 2, 13 and 14,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.400]   talks about submitting yourselves to government authorities,
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.620]   whether to a king or as to one in authority,
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.660]   or to governors as sent by him
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.140]   for the punishment of evildoers
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.340]   and the praise of those who do right.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.260]   Well, let's fill in the grid.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.420]   Authority's always delegated by God.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.980]   In fact, government authorities are described
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.260]   in this passage as ministers of God and servants of God.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.700]   It couldn't be more clear.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.680]   What's the authority?
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.780]   Already mentioned it.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.380]   It's bearing the sword.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.180]   Government has been given the authority
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.260]   by the God of the universe over life and death.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.340]   What's the purpose for bearing the sword?
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.020]   It is the punishment of evildoers.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.260]   The punishment of evildoers.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.500]   And the flip side of that is the praise
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.940]   of those who do right.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.620]   The fourth element.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.500]   Authority is always limited.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.880]   The U.S. government has no authority in England.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.540]   There's a limit.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.600]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.500]   The government of Columbia has no control
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.360]   over what happens in the United States.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.740]   That's one obvious limit on that authority.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.700]   But the government also has no authority
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.080]   in the church or in your home.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.780]   Those of you who did the pre-read,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.300]   if you did it, you read Christ, not Caesar,
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.380]   is the head of the church.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.300]   That was in your reading.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   That's why that's in your reading.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.900]   This was the core of the conflict
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.300]   between Grace Church and the state in 2020
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.080]   as it has ever been in the church.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.460]   Government always strives to overreach on their authority.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.260]   I think in the future, those of you who have young families
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.860]   are gonna understand this more and more
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.540]   that the government is overstepping their authority
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.340]   in controlling and trying to control
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.860]   what happens in your home.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.900]   You see, if authority is not explicitly given,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.100]   it's out of bounds.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.660]   Authority for government is limited.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.060]   Authority is always defined by
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.120]   and consistent with the word of God.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.340]   It's very clear that government is to punish evil
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.900]   and to reward good.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.020]   The definition of evil isn't what the government says,
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.900]   it's what who says, God says.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.300]   And good is defined by the Bible.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.500]   And a government that strays from those definitions,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.940]   looking at through history, in the Bible,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.780]   are governments that do not stand.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.020]   You see, God delegates authority.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.940]   And he defines that authority.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.140]   He states the purpose.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.500]   He limits that authority.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.140]   And that authority is to be used
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.180]   in accordance with Scripture.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.100]   And it's always for the benefit of others,
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.300]   never for personal benefit.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.380]   So what does all of this say about your leadership?
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.980]   By the way, I skipped over that.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.140]   Government are servants.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.260]   It's for your benefit, they work for you and God's economy.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.980]   Don't say that to the police officer
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.700]   that pulls you over to write you a ticket, by the way.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.580]   Doesn't work well.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.780]   What does all of this say about your leadership?
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.020]   Your leadership involves the exercise
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.860]   of authority over other people.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.620]   And in the coming sessions,
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.480]   we're gonna dive into the specific authority
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.580]   that you've been given by Jesus Christ
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.620]   as the head of your home and a leader in the church.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.980]   And if you have signed up for the pre-read,
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.660]   there is this time going to be some pre-work
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.820]   where you need to fill in this grid
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.300]   regarding leadership in the church.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.860]   Find passages in Scripture and you will find them
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.980]   to define these seven elements of church leadership.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:50.660]   But there are some very practical applications
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.140]   based on what we've seen so far.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.860]   As you consider your leadership
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.580]   and whatever role you have
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.860]   and the people God has put under your leadership,
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.140]   there are some profound implications
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:06.700]   that are drawn from an understanding of authority.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:12.220]   And I want to go through those quickly as we wrap it up.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.660]   There's seven or six implications.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.660]   There could have been more, there could have been less.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.820]   These are what came to me
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.800]   as I was wrapping up my preparation.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.200]   The first is humility.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.780]   Humility, remember that God is God and we are not.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.820]   Humility is not rooted in our weaknesses
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.340]   and failures, by the way.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.060]   Our humility flows from an understanding
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.740]   of who God is, not who we are.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.820]   He sits above the circle of the earth
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.720]   and we are like grasshoppers.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.300]   God is above all authority, he delegates all authority
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.540]   and therefore, any leadership or authority that you have,
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.100]   you have it because God gave it to you.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.180]   Don't ever forget that.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.560]   It's not because you are better,
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.940]   more qualified or good at it.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.580]   1 Corinthians 4, seven says,
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.520]   "For who regards you as superior?
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.240]   "What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.580]   "And if you did not receive it,
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.020]   "why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.020]   Remember the story of Paul when he was Saul?
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.060]   All his prior leadership as Saul,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.060]   and it was extraordinary for a young man,
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   was of absolutely no use when Christ called him to salvation
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.980]   and Christ called him to extraordinary spiritual leadership.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.100]   God did that.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.500]   A man who understands biblical authority,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.460]   his leadership is gonna be marked by humility.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:00.500]   Another mark of a man who understands authority
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.380]   is that his leadership is gonna be marked,
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.520]   his exercise of authority is gonna be marked by courage.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.460]   I hope you understand that God knows your weaknesses,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   he knows your frailties, and in spite of all of that,
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.060]   and maybe because of all of that,
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.120]   he made the sovereign, providential decision
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.980]   to grant you authority.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.600]   He puts you into service as a leader.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.900]   You can say that you're not qualified,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.380]   that you're not capable, or you're not up to the task,
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.220]   but by saying that, you're either rebelling
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.820]   against the purposes of God or you're just simply afraid.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.880]   Courage.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:52.080]   Remember 1 Corinthians 2, one through five,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.800]   Paul's humility of recognizing his failings, his weaknesses,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.200]   and his ultimate recognition of the real power
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.680]   of his leadership, it wasn't him.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:08.040]   God does not make mistakes.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.640]   Trust the Lord, be faithful,
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.760]   and lead whether you think you're the man to do it or not,
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.480]   because God has put you in that role.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.240]   Have the strength and courage to do it fully
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.560]   and to do it well.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.960]   A failure to step up is placing yourself
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.020]   above the perfect providence of God,
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.800]   and your fear is causing you to fail the people
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.440]   who have been entrusted to your servant leadership.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.160]   Remember, God puts you into service.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   Trust, obey, courage.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.040]   Third is fidelity.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.640]   Along those same lines of trusting and obeying,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.040]   your leadership must be based on Scripture,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.800]   and in accordance with God's design and purposes,
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.880]   not the way you saw your dad do it,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.660]   not the way you saw your boss at work do it,
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.320]   but is driven by what does God say,
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.520]   what does the Bible say.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.480]   Leadership is always in accordance with
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.440]   and constrained by God's word, always.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.240]   We will explore authority in the home,
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.080]   in the church, in the next two sessions,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.520]   and we must be committed to faithfully exercising
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   loving authorities within the limits ordained by God
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.140]   who delegated that authority to us.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.020]   And we must not shy away from the authority
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.420]   that we have been given.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:48.280]   Obedience is leading within the exact parameters
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.660]   defined by the one who gave us the authority.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:55.180]   He gives authority, he takes it away.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.020]   Be faithful.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.300]   Fourth, service.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   A man who understands biblical authority in leadership
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.340]   leads as a servant.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.360]   His leadership is marked by service.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.780]   Leadership authority is not for your benefit,
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.420]   for your good, your reputation, and your satisfaction.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.100]   It's always for the benefit of those
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.900]   who are under your leadership.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.080]   In fact, there may be little recognition or satisfaction
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.180]   outside the knowledge that you have before the Lord
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.520]   that you're being faithful.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.460]   You can go long stretches of time and efforts
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.560]   with no accolades.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.440]   Those of you who are young dads can shout amen if you want.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.360]   That should not deter you, by the way, in the least.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.200]   Coming home at the end of the day, a full day of work,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.880]   a leader understands that it's not the end of the day.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.520]   It's not rest time, it's game on.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.200]   This is a servant.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.000]   It's actually time to step up your efforts and stamina
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.360]   as you serve those who you are called to lead,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.460]   your wife and your children.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.180]   And your satisfaction is in that service
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.480]   and in obedience to Christ's call to servant leadership,
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.860]   not in the recognition.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:32.300]   Leadership authority is always for the benefit of others.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.400]   Serve well.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.280]   Fifth, self-control.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.720]   A man who leads with an understanding and in submission
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.440]   to the authority of God who gave you that authority
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.820]   leads in a way that is marked by self-control.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.300]   You understand your authority is limited.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.180]   Don't exceed it.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.900]   And sometimes this requires maximum self-control
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.980]   because people want to be led
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.420]   and people want to be told what to do.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:09.880]   In fact, people actually love tyranny for a while.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.260]   I thought of two verses out of Jeremiah are so stark.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.760]   Jeremiah 5, verses 30 and 31.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.960]   I'm sorry, I don't have a slide.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.800]   I thought of this at the last minute.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.320]   Here's what Jeremiah says.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.620]   An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.160]   The prophets prophesy falsely
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.960]   and the priests rule on their own authority.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.760]   Let me boil that down, see if it sounds familiar to you.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:42.480]   The leaders lie to the people and they do what they want.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.600]   And my people love it so.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.040]   Does it sound familiar?
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:55.040]   But what will you do at the end of it, he says.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.280]   It always ends.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.840]   You can get away with that for a while
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.280]   unless accountants call that a timing difference.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.840]   That does bloom in a way that does not end well.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.680]   This passage reflects badly on the people for sure.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.280]   Why would they love that?
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:17.620]   Lies and tyrannical authority, it says the people loved it.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.500]   But it's also an indictment on the leadership
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.680]   that gets out over its skis.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.280]   Spirit-filled men are marked by self-control
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.840]   and spiritual leadership is known for exercising
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:33.400]   only the authority that is specifically addressed
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.840]   in the word of God,
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.900]   even if the people want you to exercise more authority.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:43.440]   Self-control, a spirit-filled leader
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.340]   is always under control and does not impose burdens
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.920]   on the people through their exercise of their authority
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.760]   that were never authorized by the one
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.540]   who gives that authority.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.500]   Finally, curiosity.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.760]   Curiosity.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.060]   I think I'm gonna develop this more in a future session,
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.800]   but curiosity is biblical.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.680]   Your senses should be heightened to the question
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.360]   of what authority do I have as a leader at home,
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.100]   in the church, or outside the church,
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.520]   and how do I exercise that authority?
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.280]   How do I lead in light of that delegated responsibility?
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.720]   There should be a curiosity to understand
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.360]   the answers to these questions
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.880]   so that your leadership will be faithful
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.600]   to the one who gave that work to you
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   and so that your leadership would benefit those in your care
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:44.080]   to the praise and glory, not of you, but of Christ.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.280]   Be curious, men, listen, watch.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:53.840]   Learn from the Bible, imitate.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.120]   The beauty of what happens in this room every night
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.560]   is there are men all around you who are experienced.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.720]   They have wisdom.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.280]   The Bible says to go get it.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.520]   That requires a curiosity.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.280]   Don't ever lose that curiosity,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   and that curiosity requires humility,
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.920]   and so we've come full circle.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.720]   Your leadership and the exercise of any authority
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.120]   or power that you've been given has,
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   as you exercise that leadership and that authority,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.600]   you should be marked by a humility, a courage,
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   fidelity to the Bible, service, servant leadership,
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:44.440]   self-control, and a curiosity of how can I do this better?
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.120]   Let's pray.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.160]   Lord, thank you for your word.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.560]   Thank you for who you are.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:57.400]   Lord, we understand that you are authority.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.640]   You have all authority.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.600]   It's all under your purview.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.400]   Lord, we marvel that you would give us authority.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.800]   Lord, I pray for every man here tonight
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.280]   that all of us would be humble in that leadership,
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.440]   that we would seek you,
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.960]   that we would seek the truth of your word,
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.040]   that we would have that curiosity,
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.800]   not so that we know more than anybody else,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:28.000]   but so that we can be faithful and consistent
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.880]   and controlled in that leadership.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.840]   To your praise and glory, Lord,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.040]   I pray for all of the families represented here
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.880]   and the other people who fall under that leadership,
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.680]   and the other people who fall under our leadership.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.160]   Lord, may they see you through us
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:49.600]   as we lead in the church and in our homes
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.520]   and in this culture, and we pray this in Christ's name.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.360]   Amen.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
