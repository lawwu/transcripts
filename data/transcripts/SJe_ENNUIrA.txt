[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   There's this feeling that's very common for programmers and it's laden with doom.
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.140]   The feeling is it's like 9 PM and you've been working on a thing all
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.860]   day and it's almost working.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.340]   It's almost working.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.060]   And you know, if you just debug this one thing, then your project will be done
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.300]   and you'll be able to like go to, so you're like, well, I'll just stay up
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.580]   and I'll debug this one last thing.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.460]   And then you start debugging it and you get it and you solve it.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.500]   And that feels great.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.020]   And then immediately you run into one more thing.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.620]   Like, oh, it's almost running all the way through.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.780]   It's almost going end to end.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.860]   And you're like, well, I'll just stay up a little bit longer.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.580]   And you know, before you know it, it's like 2 AM and you keep going
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.860]   cause it, it feels so good.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.500]   Like you, you feel the sense of forward progress.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.820]   You're not just staring at a wall.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.340]   I think like for the programming problems where you are at a brick wall,
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.580]   it doesn't feel like this.
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.420]   It feels bad.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.460]   Um, so can every field be transformed into something where you can feel
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.620]   the sense of forward progress?
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.700]   You can get this rapid feedback cycle.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300]   I think that's really hard.
