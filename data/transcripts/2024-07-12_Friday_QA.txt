[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:48.800]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, live Q&A.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.960]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   a show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.080]   with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.840]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   now, while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.960]   in the coming years or less.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.520]   Today is Friday, July 12, 2024.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   And on this Friday, as we do on most Fridays
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760]   when I can arrange a microphone, we have live Q&A.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.320]   You call in, talk about anything you want, raise any question,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.680]   raise any topic, anything you want,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.400]   you are in charge of today's podcast.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.800]   For those of you who are new to the podcast,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   if you would like to join me on one of these Friday Q&A shows,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.400]   you can do that by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.960]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.160]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.400]   Sign up to support the show on Patreon,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.360]   and that will gain access for you to one of these Friday Q&A
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600]   shows, which allows me to just control the number of callers
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200]   just a little bit so we don't have mammoth four-hour shows.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.800]   My mammoth three-hour shows are good enough.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.640]   I usually stretch it out well enough.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   Rahul in Washington, welcome to the show.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.920]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.280]   Great to talk to you.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.040]   I've been listening to your podcast for some time,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.440]   and I always found them intellectually stimulating
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.360]   and thought-provoking.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   So thanks for that.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.760]   Thank you.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.600]   So I had a question around internationalization
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.880]   and how to go about planning for it or how to approach it.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.520]   This would be right up your alley,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.720]   and I don't even need to ask.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.120]   But there are two interesting parts that I want to touch on.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   One is for people who don't have a business,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.680]   like people who are salaried and they have a good salary job.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.160]   And the second is from the perspective
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.440]   of people who are immigrants in the US and not US citizens.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.480]   So they have the option of--
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.440]   I think you talk about giving up the US citizenship as one
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.720]   of your things in the course that you have as well.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.200]   So maybe if you can touch up on some of these,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.240]   and I can give you more details.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.480]   Yeah, is this kind of just a general conversation,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.320]   or are you actually thinking about something yourself?
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.840]   I have talked about it many times before,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.760]   but I think it's just a very tricky thing
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.800]   to wrap around in the sense of the impact on the family.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.320]   And there's more than financial aspects involved as well.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   So I think those are probably things that are personal
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   and one can work on on their own.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   But from your perspective, I wanted
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.320]   to get a sense of what are some of the implications
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480]   or questions that one should think about or plan for,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.360]   especially around--
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.840]   just to give you an example, I don't
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.040]   know what's the case for US.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   But I think some companies have the notion of an exit tax
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   or if you move across borders.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.600]   And there are some challenges.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000]   I know Canada probably has something
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.560]   where if you move there for some number of years
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   and then come back, the income that you made there,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.480]   there's some tax implications of that.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.680]   So just broadly in those lines, yeah.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.720]   So you're an immigrant to the United States, is that right?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   And do you have permanent residency in the United States
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   now?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.560]   Not yet.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm on the path to that.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.720]   Great.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.840]   OK.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.360]   And where are you from originally?
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   From India.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.760]   OK, and married, have children?
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.400]   Yes.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   And you're building wealth as a salaried worker
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.920]   in the United States.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.560]   And do you have any reason to think
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.720]   that you might want to leave the United States?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.880]   I think it's primarily the uncertainty of certain things.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.960]   Like I think-- I'm not sure how much familiar you are
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.080]   about some of these things.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.040]   But for certain countries, the backlog
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   is huge in terms of how long it takes
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.080]   for people to get a green card.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.120]   And India and China are among those.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   So I think it's just been a long time.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.280]   And there's always some restriction
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.360]   in terms of whether or not you can start your business.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.960]   Right.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.400]   So let me cut straight to it, because I
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.440]   am very familiar with it.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.280]   And let me give you some big picture ideas
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.760]   that I think are useful.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.320]   First and foremost, internationalization
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   should always be held in balance based upon where you are.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.080]   So if you come from India and you
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.160]   were able to get a job that allows you to immigrate
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.080]   to the United States, there is almost certainly
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.520]   much more opportunity for you in the United States
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   today than there is in India.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.160]   You Indian immigrants are amazingly productive.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.800]   I mean, I have enjoyed interacting with immigrants
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.480]   to the United States from India more than almost anything,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.680]   because you are smart, you're incredibly hardworking,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.800]   and there's such a great culture around the tech industry where--
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.880]   I mean, you guys go to the moon.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.000]   You have a cultural expression of excellence.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.440]   And the United States loves people
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.720]   like you who are hardworking, who are productive,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.320]   who are intelligent.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   The country bends over backwards to reward people like you.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   And while there are some problems for people like you
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.680]   in the United States, I would say
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.560]   those problems are probably a lot smaller
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   than they are in many other places of the world.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.520]   Nowhere is perfect, but there's a lot of benefits.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.960]   And the financial opportunities for someone like you
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   are probably--
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.000]   are almost certainly so much higher in the United States
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.040]   than almost anywhere else in the world.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.560]   There are other places that are friendly to immigrants,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   but the United States is exceedingly friendly
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.360]   to immigrants and rewards hard work and productivity
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.400]   more than most other places.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360]   The United States is a wonderful place to live.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.840]   The culture is very, very accepting.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.760]   One of the things that's my favorite things about Americans
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.160]   is that if you express the basics of American culture
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.200]   in the way that you express yourself,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.720]   I am convinced that of all the places I have traveled,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.280]   that the United States is probably
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.600]   the most welcoming country in the world for immigrants.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.160]   Because we don't-- we kind of native-born Americans,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   we don't judge people based upon where they're from.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.600]   We judge people primarily based upon who they are.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.520]   And so it's not uncommon for an American to say,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.440]   man, you're American through and through,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.880]   or you're more American than I am,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.840]   to someone who's an immigrant, who may not even
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.280]   be a US citizen yet.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   Because we see things culturally in terms
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.000]   of the American culture.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.520]   And does somebody embrace the values
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.240]   that are common in the United States
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.480]   as compared to other places that are primarily focused
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.160]   on language or ethnicity or religion, things like that?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.480]   And so I hope that you've had a good welcoming experience
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.400]   in the United States, because I see that.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.200]   It's not perfect.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.780]   There are a bunch of jerks everywhere,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.040]   but it does work pretty well.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.400]   On an overall basis--
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.200]   go ahead.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.760]   Yeah, I just wanted to echo that.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.000]   Yes, that's definitely true.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.960]   I think I've definitely loved spending time here.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.360]   And all the things that you talked about in terms
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.640]   of being a welcoming culture, the abundance
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.200]   of opportunities, the ability to make friendships and not
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.280]   have a language barrier, all those are true.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.780]   Right.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.280]   Go ahead.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.000]   Good, OK.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.680]   So the biggest question for you, though,
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.360]   is, can I stay in the United States?
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.960]   And so you need to-- in order to be
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.880]   able to stay permanently in the United States,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.960]   you need to get your permanent residence or your green card.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.400]   And it's not usually easy for people
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.640]   to get on a pathway to a green card or a permanent residence
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.320]   in the United States, especially if they're
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.480]   from India, from China, or from many other nations.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.720]   I have spent a lot of time observing immigration systems
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.320]   around the world and participating in them myself.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.000]   I have nothing good to say about the US immigration system.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.240]   So if you are on track for something,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.120]   and if your lawyer tells you, hey, we're
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.800]   on track for permanent residence,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.400]   then it's probably best just to stay on track with that.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.120]   Because there is actually-- once you get permanent residence,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.160]   there is actually a genuine pathway
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   to citizenship in the United States.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.240]   And that is something that for your entire family
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.480]   can be an amazing value.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.920]   When we think about internationalization,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.320]   first we want to put on a lens of opportunity.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.400]   And so you could think of this as kind of plan A.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.040]   What place in the world offers me
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.320]   the best opportunity for me, my family, my skills,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.560]   things like that?
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.520]   And the amount of opportunity that a place offers to you
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.480]   is going to depend on where you are in your life.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.640]   So if you need opportunity for a job that's
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.880]   going to pay you wages, that allows you to save money
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   and build assets, then you need to go to a place that
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.440]   has great job opportunities.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.520]   And the United States is the best place in the world
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   that I know of for that.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.520]   Now, if you are wealthy and financially independent--
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.840]   you have your own businesses, you have your own savings,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.000]   you have several millions of dollars in the bank--
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.480]   then the place that offers you opportunity,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.880]   you may not need a job opportunity anymore.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.080]   And the United States is pretty decent towards wealthy people,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.300]   but there may be better corners of the earth.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.120]   You may want to live on a little tax-free island somewhere
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.080]   so you can just be completely tax-free.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.320]   Or you may want to live in a place that provides you
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.360]   with better investment opportunities with, again,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.600]   low taxes.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.480]   And so people who are wealthy are often
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.360]   those who are looking for other kinds of opportunities.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.880]   But if you're still building wealth through employment,
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.340]   I don't know of a place that's better in the United States,
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.280]   especially with a long-term better future.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.840]   There are places you can earn well in the United States--
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.120]   sorry, around the world.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.600]   So many people, many of your fellow countrymen
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.960]   will go to a place like Dubai or many other centers
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.240]   where you can get a good job.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.600]   But the challenge is that those places
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.080]   don't seem to me to be very good at acculturating people.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.880]   Every single worker that I've known who's gone to Dubai
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.440]   says, OK, I can go here.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.360]   I can make money.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.520]   But they made some immigration reforms in the last year or two,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.960]   but there's basically no pathway to permanent residence.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.040]   And there's certainly no pathway to citizenship.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.520]   And you're always going to be a foreigner.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.320]   And the entire culture is based around people coming and going.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.120]   So there's not the plantedness.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.600]   There's not the settledness.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.780]   But for you and your family in the United States,
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.560]   you have a totally different set of options.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   There is a pathway to permanent residency.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   There is a pathway to citizenship.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.240]   And your children will be fully accepted Americans,
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.240]   just like you and your wife will be fully accepted Americans
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.720]   if you aren't already, regardless
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.040]   of actual citizenship status.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.680]   So I think the United States has a lot to offer as a plan A.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.560]   Now, with regard to a plan B, then you
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.000]   look at, well, why would I need another place to go?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.020]   And so a lot of times, what I think about
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.760]   is, well, maybe there's an economic crisis
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.640]   in your home country.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.680]   Or maybe you're facing some kind of political or religious
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.080]   persecution, things like that.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.720]   And so it's not that the United States is the perfect place.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.400]   But it may be more important for you
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.320]   to be focusing on the plan A stuff,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.760]   building wealth at this stage of your life, than anything else.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.660]   Now, there are a few interesting tricks
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.360]   that are probably not yet relevant to your life.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.400]   So from time to time-- in fact, I've
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.040]   worked with a couple of Indian clients,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.120]   specifically in this situation, who
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   have built wealth in the United States,
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   usually through being involved in an early-stage tech
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.080]   startup, having significant growth
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.480]   in the value of their stock.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.500]   And now they're looking at things more strategically.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.800]   And they're saying, should I go ahead
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.960]   and get permanent residence?
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.280]   Because after all, I don't want to be a covered person.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.320]   And there's a few interesting little wrinkles
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.600]   of the tax code.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.080]   There are a couple of planning ideas
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.000]   that can be put in where you can avoid US taxation,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.160]   especially if you don't want to be connected
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.400]   to the country for the long-term.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.120]   But that's probably-- unless you correct me,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   that's probably not applicable to you yet.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.520]   And so I just wouldn't worry about it.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.480]   I would say, you're going to be a lot better off living,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.920]   working in the United States, building wealth,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.240]   having a great place to live for your family,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.720]   and then reassess those questions in the future.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   The nice thing-- the other challenge for Indians,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.780]   the reason why they usually will be attracted to other options,
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.960]   is that the Indian passport makes
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.400]   your international travel not so great.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.560]   And so India does not allow dual citizenship.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.880]   So if you became an American citizen,
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.680]   you would have to surrender your Indian passport, as you know.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.960]   But for most Indians, there's such a substantial upgrade
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.040]   in terms of how you're treated around the world, of now
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.660]   you're treated as an American instead of as an Indian,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.800]   that that's worth it.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.640]   And then since you can turn around and get
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.240]   your Indian Overseas Citizen card, which is basically
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.360]   a permanent residence that allows you to always have
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   full access to India, the only thing
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.560]   you don't have as an Overseas Citizen
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.800]   is simply the Indian passport, which,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.520]   compared to an American passport or a Canadian passport
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.400]   or a German passport or most places, is really inferior.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.720]   So I think you can still be very well-connected
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.920]   to both countries.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.680]   And your children can also access that.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.120]   So that if in the future, India may very well
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.240]   be positioned to have an amazing century coming ahead.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   And so you can go back and forth between the two countries.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.800]   You can live and work and bank in both places.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.840]   You can build businesses in both places.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.160]   And so to me, that seems like something really worth having.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.760]   Makes sense.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.200]   I think all of those things make sense.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.120]   And I've thought about that.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.040]   One part-- and I don't want to take a lot of time--
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.000]   but maybe you can touch upon the plan B aspect of it.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.800]   So the plan A makes sense.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.100]   And that's kind of how I'm looking at it.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:08.220]   But plan B in terms of like, let's, as a backup option,
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.220]   if you could touch on other English-speaking countries
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.940]   or if you have experience with Australia and New Zealand,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:24.580]   Canada, just briefly on any specific aspects
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.940]   there that one could investigate further on their own.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.660]   Sure.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.460]   So the way I look at this is quite simply
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.220]   just from a complementary redundancy basis.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.900]   So most people are going to go through their lifetime.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.540]   And most people are never going to need anything other
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.220]   than the country they were born in,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.740]   the basics of the place that they're from.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.220]   Everything's probably going to work out just fine.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.820]   Most people aren't going to need anything else.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.620]   So this world of internationalization,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.860]   I think it's important.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.920]   And I think it makes a lot of sense to pay attention to.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.340]   But I also acknowledge that the chances of this being needed
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.860]   are fairly modest.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.100]   I've made public podcasts that you probably
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.460]   listen to of the reasons that are the most persuasive to me.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.860]   So for example, why did I myself want options
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.780]   other than the United States?
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.420]   Some big options were things like I
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.180]   was worried about my children being drafted in a war.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.820]   I don't want my children to be drafted in some pointless war
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.940]   and sent off to the other side of the world to die.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.600]   I don't want to go and serve in an army
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.000]   for some legitimate reason, because they
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.160]   think the cause is just and the war is morally righteous.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.560]   That's their prerogative.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.040]   But I don't want them to be stuck in a situation like that,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   where they have to go and die in a useless war.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.480]   I would like more for their life than for them
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.080]   to be fed to--
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.040]   killed as cannon fodder.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.360]   Other things, things like, hey, taxation
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.880]   could change in the future.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.960]   And I don't think it's fair to my children
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.140]   if they're stuck paying for a system
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.820]   that their great-grandparents borrowed a bunch of money,
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.860]   and now my children are weighted down
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.500]   with the strain of all this.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.100]   Now, I think that that's less likely.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.340]   I think that the United States is going to default
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.100]   on all of its obligations through a variety of means,
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.580]   rather than impose onerous taxes.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.060]   But hey, I could be wrong.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.620]   And so it seems--
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.740]   and there are other reasons as well--
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.860]   moral causes of paying for something that is morally wrong,
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.660]   paying for a war that is morally wrong,
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.540]   or paying for things like abortion that is morally wrong.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.500]   I think it's nice to not have to singe your conscience
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.800]   if you can avoid it.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.140]   But on the whole, I'm not angry against the United States.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.020]   And those are problems that most people face.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.600]   What I've observed of thinking about these things
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.620]   is simply that in order for them to be effective,
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.660]   you have to do the preparation many years in advance.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.300]   So for example, a couple of months ago, the Ukrainian--
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.100]   first of all, the best example that we have right now
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.180]   is the Russia-Ukraine war.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.660]   Now, Russia's regulations are different.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.740]   I've paid a lot of attention to both the Russians
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.780]   and the Ukrainian response.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.020]   But I consider it a decent example.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.560]   So when Ukraine was invaded, immediately
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.900]   the Ukrainian government closed the border
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.260]   to all men of fighting age, which was a very wide band.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.540]   I forget the exact number.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.660]   It may have been 18 to 60 or 18 to 65.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.500]   It was 55.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.220]   I don't remember.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.140]   But basically, everyone who was an adult to old age,
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.980]   the Ukrainian government shut the border.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.460]   That was really rough, because I believe that I understand.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.340]   I think that if there is a just war at all,
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.100]   the Ukrainian cause is perfectly just.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.980]   And if there is a time in which you're
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.580]   going to be willing to fight for your country, then this is it.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.380]   You're going to go and defend your country
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.900]   from a foreign invader.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.660]   I still look at it, and I consider the entire exercise
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.180]   enormously useless.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.060]   And it hurts my heart, because I want
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.220]   to stand for righteousness.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.620]   But on the whole, if you're going
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.500]   to go and die for something, you want
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.740]   to have at least some hope that your death is
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.540]   going to be for some good.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.680]   And I don't see why--
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.180]   I don't see anybody whose lives have
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.980]   been improved with the hundreds of thousands
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.260]   of men who've died.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.380]   I don't see how anything is better for it.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.620]   And I don't see how the cause makes
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.540]   any difference in the long run.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.060]   And so when I think about what I want for me in my life
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.060]   or for my sons in their lives, I don't
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.380]   want them to die in a useless cause
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.020]   and have your population stripped out with war.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.660]   It seems pointless to me.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.740]   So there is kind of an element of what's
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.420]   morally right and wrong.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.140]   And then there's an element of what's practically intelligent.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.100]   Anyway, as time has gone on, Ukraine
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.340]   has expanded its draft to include more and more categories
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.300]   of people.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.420]   And what they have done, though, is they still
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.100]   are very, very low on soldiers.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.620]   And so what they're doing right now--
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.660]   and I haven't checked to see if this is still in force.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.940]   If it was in force a couple of months ago,
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.940]   I think it probably is.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.780]   But I haven't checked as of today, July 12.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.460]   But a couple of months ago, Ukraine
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.420]   passed a law that said that they have stopped
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.380]   providing consular services for all male Ukrainian citizens
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.660]   living abroad.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.940]   And what that means is because they're not
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.140]   providing consular services.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.460]   So if you had a Ukrainian passport,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.980]   and let's say you had emigrated to the United States,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.420]   but you held a Ukrainian passport
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.500]   and you lived in the United States
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.940]   for the last seven or eight years,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.860]   but you're not a citizen of the United States,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.820]   and now you just want to renew your Ukrainian passport,
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.580]   well, they won't renew it for you.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.500]   They want you to go back to Ukraine and fight in the war.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.460]   And they will not renew your passport for you.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.660]   They're not arresting you at the embassy, at least not yet.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.580]   But they're not going to renew your paperwork.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.940]   What's even more challenging is, let's say
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.580]   that you had gone abroad.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.980]   Let's say you had been abroad for many years,
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.340]   but you hadn't actually set up something
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.140]   like an official residence permit.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.340]   Because if you had an American residence permit,
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   but your passport expired, you would
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.820]   be stuck in the United States, unable to travel abroad.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.380]   But you could still probably plead for asylum
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.140]   and keep your paperwork moving forward
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.780]   with regard to your residency.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.700]   I've consulted with various people, especially
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.060]   Venezuelans in the United States,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   who have been able to do this.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.580]   They couldn't get their Venezuelan passport
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.980]   renewed because the government wouldn't provide consular
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.660]   services.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.460]   But they didn't get kicked out of the United States.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.980]   So they were just stuck there until they could figure out
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.780]   a solution.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.220]   And now, thankfully, many of them
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.060]   have been able to get their documents, again, renewed.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.940]   But what if you were applying for a residence program?
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.780]   Well, when you go to apply for a residence program,
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.300]   most of the time--
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.980]   all the time, excuse me, all the time,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.020]   you need a birth certificate.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.260]   And if your country is part of the Hague Convention,
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.060]   then you need to have your birth certificate apostilled.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.300]   Well, the Ukrainian embassy won't provide birth
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.820]   certificates and won't apostill them
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.420]   for its citizens living abroad.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.060]   It won't provide background reports of--
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.020]   police background reports, which are also
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.940]   a standard part of the package.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.220]   So those Ukrainians who left Ukraine 10 years ago,
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.620]   who have decided that it doesn't make sense for me to go
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.500]   and potentially sacrifice my life in this war,
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.380]   even though they're probably entirely
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.660]   on the side of the Ukrainians, and even though, in many cases,
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.100]   maybe they do much more good from abroad.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.820]   The Americans only won their revolution
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.140]   because of the work that Ben Franklin
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.780]   did to get the French on their side.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.340]   So who knows?
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.260]   Maybe they're doing all kinds of stuff abroad.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.540]   But without special dispensation from the government,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.420]   they can't make it.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.980]   So examples like that have basically
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.980]   convinced me that what you need to do
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   is you need to have all of this stuff in place,
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.500]   preferably a decade or two before you need it.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.900]   So a Ukrainian dual national who is American-Ukrainian
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.660]   has no problem.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.780]   Because, OK, he can't renew his Ukrainian passport.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.180]   No problem.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.900]   But he still has his American one.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.180]   Or a Ukrainian who moved to Mexico
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.820]   and had a Mexican residency, he's OK.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.500]   He's got it taken care of, because he can stay in Mexico.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.220]   And then later on, he can become a Mexican citizen.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   He has a backup plan.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.300]   But that's got to be done before you need it.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.620]   So I look at that, and I just say, all right, two is one.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.160]   One is none.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.000]   Three is a guarantee.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.020]   And that's for me.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   So how can I think about the three different things
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.940]   that I need in any particular situation?
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.700]   And as you know, because it sounds like you
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.060]   took my international escape plan course,
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.020]   and if anyone listening hasn't taken it,
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.100]   internationalescapeplan.com, please.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.740]   internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.100]   I look at it and say, all right, I
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.740]   need three forms of identification
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.660]   to get me across a border.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.540]   And so I myself have two US passports and a passport card,
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.580]   plus a global entry card.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.540]   Well, so that's four.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.620]   I have four ways to get back and forth across a border.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.540]   And two of them that'll work on airplanes, and four of them
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.100]   that'll work across the land and sea borders around the United
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.900]   States.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.380]   But then I say, well, I need three places
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.620]   that I can go around the world.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.100]   Two is one.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.540]   One is none.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.380]   Three is a guarantee.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.060]   So let me just choose three places
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.300]   and set up three different residency permits.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.940]   And there's nothing magical about three.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.100]   One is good.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.740]   So you, as an Indian with an American residency,
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.540]   are far better off than an Indian who doesn't
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.100]   have an American residency.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.860]   And so it's just a matter of working towards it
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.220]   systematically over time, when you see an opportunity that
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.660]   fits you, to go ahead and build a portfolio.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.860]   So I want to have three countries that I can live in.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.660]   I'd like for those countries to be different from one another.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.200]   Sometimes I want to be with a big country where I've got good
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   economic opportunities.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.100]   Sometimes, if I could, I'd love to have a neutral country that
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.420]   was less likely to be involved in wars.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.480]   And maybe I'd like to have a tax-free country,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.820]   so I can use that as a future option.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.380]   There's lots of ways that you can look for things,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.600]   but we're looking for complementary redundancy.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.100]   Now, what's the problem?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.700]   Well, the problem is that none of this stuff is free or easy.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.580]   So you mentioned English-speaking countries.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.380]   Well, that's not actually a very big list.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.780]   You've got the United States.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.700]   You've got Canada.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.700]   You've got Great Britain.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.860]   You've got Ireland.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.860]   You've got Australia.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.020]   You've got New Zealand.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.540]   I think those six are all that are officially
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.260]   English-speaking.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.740]   Now, English is widely spoken all around the world,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.180]   but those are the big six English-speaking countries.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.100]   And most of them are not that interested in making it easy
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.700]   for immigrants to come there.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.940]   And so you need to generally have quite a bit of money
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.740]   if you're going to buy yourself a residence
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.420]   permit in the United States or in Canada.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.340]   You need to have a good bit of money generally,
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.820]   or you need to be highly educated.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.300]   Or in general, they have high requirements for you
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.100]   to be there physically on the ground, which
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.620]   is hard to satisfy if you're working a job where
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.540]   you're working in Seattle.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.900]   And so you may not be able to access those countries.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.940]   However, that doesn't mean there aren't other opportunities.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.100]   You probably could get yourself a Mexican residence
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.540]   permit, which is world class.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.140]   All Americans should have a Mexican residence permit.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.900]   Latin America is very accepting of immigrants
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.340]   who can come and show that they have
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.100]   some form of passive income.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.980]   Latin America looks for passive income.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.380]   Asia looks for net worth.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.340]   So if you have net worth that you've built up,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.980]   you can get permits to live in various places.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.740]   So it's not easy to get backup plans
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.140]   in the English-speaking countries,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.340]   although it's doable if you have enough money.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.500]   But that may not necessarily be what you need,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.740]   because it's just a matter of choosing--
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.860]   really, any place is good as a backup
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.780]   as you're working towards your ideal scenario.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.700]   But due to the physical presence requirements,
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.100]   you probably can't deal with most of the programs
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.380]   in the English-speaking countries.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.460]   At Cox Mobile, we know you're smart.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.500]   You brush your teeth in the shower to save time,

[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.820]   and wear goggles to cut onions.

[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.140]   So smart.

[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.420]   Thanks a lot.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.260]   - My pleasure.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.580]   Did I answer your questions?
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.940]   - Yes, I think I got enough to chew upon
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.100]   and I loved your take on some of these things.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.940]   - Good, good.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.780]   - Thanks.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.620]   - Yeah, it's not easy,
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.060]   but all I would say is I love to think
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.100]   about the extreme cases.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.380]   Meaning, if I could, I could lay out the plans
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.300]   of here are the 10 different citizenships
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.940]   that I'd like to get in my lifetime.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.940]   What I learned is simply going from one to two
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.900]   is an enormous increase in options
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.700]   and probably all that anybody needs.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.740]   Going from two to three almost certainly covers everything.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.860]   So if, as an Indian, you can't get another citizenship
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.060]   without losing your Indian citizenship.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.020]   So that's a big cost.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.340]   So I would just look first at residencies
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.300]   and say, all right, United States, I've got one there.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.500]   I can't be absent from the United States
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.860]   for significant periods of time
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.820]   or I'll lose my pathway to permanent residency
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.340]   and I'll lose my pathway to citizenship.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.740]   So the United States is probably where it's gonna be
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.980]   for all the reasons we discussed
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.260]   at the beginning of the call.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.980]   So I would just choose one or another country
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.220]   and look around and see if there's a residence permit
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.500]   that I can get pretty simply
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500]   that doesn't have a lot of physical presence requirement.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.140]   Hint, hint, Mexico.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.100]   Mexico within a few years is going to change their laws,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.660]   I'm sure of it, 'cause they all do, they always do.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.020]   And the Mexican investor with means
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.500]   or person of means visa program is so stinking generous.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.940]   It's unmatched on a global basis.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.420]   So that should be almost certainly your next action.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.140]   And it makes really great strategic sense
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.540]   because of where you are right now in the United States.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.340]   So that would be kind of the next action,
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.140]   but recognize that there are many, many other countries
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.180]   that are also out there.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.580]   Just know that this probably shouldn't be your next hobby.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.580]   It's a lot of hassle to go and pick this stuff up.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.600]   So try to build a strategic plan,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.740]   get into it because it's fun for a time,
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.580]   but then once you get the stuff done, then let it go.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.500]   You don't need eight, just three.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500]   Working towards three over the course of the next decade
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.600]   should be fine.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.020]   All right, we go on to Richard in New York.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.860]   Richard, welcome to the show.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.580]   - Hey, Joshua.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.580]   Yes, my name's Richard.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.460]   I'm a 39-year-old male and I'm recently married.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.460]   Very much thanks to the advice that you've given
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.480]   about getting married sooner rather than later.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.820]   So very much appreciate that.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.660]   - Congratulations.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.180]   - That was ideal.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.020]   - Thank you so much.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.180]   And I do not have a prenup
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.900]   and that episode was very pivotal in my decision-making.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.940]   So once again, thank you.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:27.780]   - Good.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.060]   - I'm currently a real estate investor
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.820]   and I'm living abroad with my wife
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.620]   and I have no W-2 or earned income since I am abroad.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:41.060]   So the dilemma is currently I'm about $150,000 in debt,
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.640]   in various debt, mostly credit card,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.340]   which I know is really bad,
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.340]   but a net worth of about 1.5 million,
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.020]   which is strictly in real estate and in crypto.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.540]   The other problem is I have basically zero cash
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.280]   and zero liquidity.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.340]   And right now I'm living off of my wife's savings
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.140]   and she has an unsteady, unpredictable income.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.900]   So obviously this is not a good place to be in
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.740]   and I have a bunch of real estate transactions,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.260]   properties for sale, refinances in progress
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.680]   to get me out of this liquidity crunch.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.820]   But basically my question comes down to this.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.940]   So currently I also have a failed flip
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.940]   that's not going so well, it's still on the market for sale.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.900]   And I could either just sell it at a loss right now
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.540]   and just, so after the refinances and sales
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.900]   of all these other properties and what have you,
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.200]   if I sell this property at a loss,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.060]   I would probably have about $50,000 net,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.140]   which would be used for me to live off of,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.100]   as well as to plan a wedding.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.620]   And also thanks to your advice,
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.660]   we were planning on a very simple, rather simple wedding,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.060]   as opposed to delaying.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.340]   Or I can keep this failed flip,
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.980]   which is currently costing me about $3,500 a month
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.260]   in interest, but in order to keep it,
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.380]   I would have to sell two Bitcoin,
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.000]   which I own, currently own eight,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.500]   and they are in a self-directed retirement account.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.400]   So by selling those two Bitcoin,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.220]   it would obviously be all taxable income.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.780]   But by doing so, it would allow me to keep this flip,
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.300]   which is like I said, costing 3,500 a month,
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.180]   and it would either be cashflow neutral
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.220]   or cashflow positive net of expenses,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.100]   management fees, CapEx, et cetera.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.020]   And just a little bit more background info,
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.900]   the house is worth about 500,000.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:30.100]   So basically the question is to sell the flip at a loss,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.740]   and also one last thing is,
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.860]   if I were to sell the two Bitcoin,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.660]   it would be about $58,000.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.700]   Well, that's what the price of the Bitcoin is right now.
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.740]   Net, and that would also be used to pay for a wedding
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.540]   as well as living expenses, but just bear in mind,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.980]   it would be the taxable implications for the following year.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.460]   - Understood, great summary, by the way.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.260]   Do you, are you currently, excuse me,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.840]   are you current on your debts at the moment?
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.740]   - Yeah, so I'm working on refinances.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.580]   I have a couple of properties for sale, so yes.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.940]   - Okay, but your credit cards are paid at the moment,
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.180]   and although-- - Yep, no, no,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.860]   credit score of 716, so yep.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.940]   - All right, are you employable?
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.180]   Could you get a job?
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:22.820]   - Oh, so I was a pharmacist in the States.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.820]   I'm now living abroad in Europe,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.340]   and so that was, unfortunately those skills,
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.820]   my certifications, they wouldn't transfer over,
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.180]   and it would take quite a bit of a while to, yeah.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.780]   So just in brief, no.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.220]   - What does living abroad mean?
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.460]   Like, you're just renting in a flat somewhere in Europe,
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.940]   and you've been there for a little while,
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.040]   or you're totally all in Europe at this point?
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.220]   - So that's, well, this is a lot of talk
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.460]   about internationalization.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.740]   So my wife is having, we're having some troubles
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.060]   with her getting her green card over here.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.500]   So if she can't come to me, I decided to come over to her.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   So I'm here in Europe, and just, yeah, living abroad.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.740]   - All right, your wife is European, not American,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.660]   and you couldn't get her residence
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.740]   in the United States until married,
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.400]   but you are legally married now?
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.420]   - Yes.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.220]   - And what is the advice for somebody
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.100]   who's legally married to a foreign national
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   with regard to getting U.S. residency?
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.540]   - So we're in the process of getting her green card,
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.260]   as well as me applying for a E.U. residency here.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.380]   - Okay.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.460]   - To have both options for both of us.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:32.020]   - Well, basically, so let's pretend
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.980]   that you could move back to the United States.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.060]   Are there, is it called locum's work in pharmacy work?
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.900]   Like, are there, have you looked to see if pharmacists,
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.660]   are you current on your certifications as a pharmacist,
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.300]   and have you looked to see if there are positions
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.660]   available as a pharmacist?
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.260]   - Yeah, so I actually recently quit my job
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.820]   after we got married because of the visa issues.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.660]   They said it would take,
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.920]   even though we're already legally married,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.380]   we got married abroad, it would take about a year
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.580]   to a year and a half for her to get her papers.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.900]   So instead of doing long distance,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.780]   which is what we have been doing,
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.540]   I decided, well, if she can't come here,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.900]   I'm just gonna go there. - Understood.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.660]   - Or, well, I'm here now. - Understood.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.460]   Where in Europe are you currently living?
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.760]   - In Spain. - Okay.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.980]   Well, I don't love,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.620]   there are a few plans that I don't love.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.720]   So the first plan that I don't love
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.420]   is I don't love you selling assets if it can be avoided.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:43.580]   It certainly is smart for you to sell assets
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:48.620]   if you are avoiding being delinquent on your debts,
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.660]   going bankrupt, things like that.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.420]   So you do have assets that you could sell.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.940]   And if you have a conviction about the market value
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.420]   of some of your assets,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.880]   if you think that Bitcoin is going down by 50%
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.600]   in the next five months,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.720]   or if you think that real estate is going down by 50%
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.560]   in the next five months, then clearly you should sell.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.820]   Taxes in and of themselves are never a sufficient reason
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.480]   to just hold on to a bad investment.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.000]   But you didn't articulate to me
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.200]   that you think your real estate values are going to decline
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.720]   or that you think your Bitcoin is going to decline in value.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.880]   You simply said, you know, I've got these assets
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.920]   that I could sell to cover my debts
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   and cover my expenses if I needed to.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.720]   So I don't love the idea of selling assets
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.600]   unless it's absolutely, unless it's actually necessary.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   Now, you should always sell any investment asset
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.300]   that is a bad deal.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.680]   And so if something you know,
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.960]   hey, I bought this house
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.500]   thinking this house was going to be great,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.680]   but now I've found out
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.520]   that I'm never going to be able to rent it
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.460]   because of X, Y, Z problem, then fine, sell it.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.960]   But I don't love the idea of you doing it
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.520]   unless it's necessary.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.360]   So let's move on to other options.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.240]   I don't want you to get behind on your debts.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.100]   I don't want you to not pay bills.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.180]   I don't want you to have trouble there.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.340]   That's not going to work.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.100]   So the obvious solution here is for you to get a job.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.100]   If you could get cashflow coming in from a job of some kind,
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.360]   then that can solve your problem.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.080]   And if you guys are newlyweds,
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.680]   your wife has a job, she has income,
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.280]   if you can currently live on her salary,
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.640]   then every dollar that you earn
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.040]   can be put towards paying off the debt.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.480]   And if you were earning a pharmacist's wages,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.120]   then a couple of years from now,
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.720]   you may sell a house, you can keep the Bitcoin,
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.120]   but you may turn around and you have the ability then
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.520]   to just with your cashflow,
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.620]   two years from now, you're totally out of debt.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.200]   And that's going to be the one
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.120]   that you're the happiest with
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.640]   'cause then you still own all the real estate,
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.000]   you still own the Bitcoin,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.960]   and now you've taken care of the debt.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.740]   So I don't mind, okay, does it stink to be in debt?
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.320]   Sure, that sucks for a time,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.680]   but you could probably be one to three years away
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.120]   from making it.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.880]   And it may be the case that, again,
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   you can turn one of your deals into a significant profit.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.680]   So I'm not universally saying don't sell a house.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.320]   If there's a house that makes sense to sell,
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.640]   then sell a house.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.280]   And I'm not universally saying,
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.480]   I think I'm repeating myself.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.920]   I'm not saying what to do it.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.600]   What I am saying is the obvious solution
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.800]   is keep your expenses as close to nothing as possible
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.360]   and increase your income.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.480]   So the strategic move from an income perspective
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.400]   will be this.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.720]   First of all, once you have,
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.040]   so you're married to a European woman.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.280]   So that gives you full rights of residence
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.380]   in the European Union, including right to work.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.880]   So you need to really make sure you understand
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   everything that is necessary
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   for you to work as a pharmacist or in a similar profession
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.640]   or a related profession in Europe.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.440]   And you should understand what those options are for you.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.720]   It's probably not gonna be your best option,
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.920]   especially in Spain, right?
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.640]   The Spanish wanna hire Spaniards.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.400]   They're not so welcoming as Americans are to foreigners,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.200]   especially in fancy jobs like that,
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.560]   even from just a cultural perspective.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.080]   But don't take my word for it.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.920]   Go and look, go and see what you can find
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.600]   and make sure you understand a lot about the options.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.680]   Does your wife work in a physical office
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.840]   or does her job have some remote component?
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.960]   - Well, it's very seasonal.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.240]   So it's very seasonal work.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   So it's during the summer, like during peak tourism
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.640]   and then it dies off in the winter.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.680]   But I did wanna just touch base
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.320]   because either way, like so this,
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.440]   when I said if I sold the flip at a loss
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.960]   and it would be 50K positive net to like,
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.800]   that would be positive
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.200]   as well as being able to keep the home,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.560]   I guess I was really just trying to decide between,
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.720]   I understand your advice of getting a job.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.880]   And so for pharmacy, that'd be quite difficult
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.800]   because I mean, I do speak Spanish,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.000]   but in terms of the certifications and like,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   it's just, it would take a couple of years at the least.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.400]   So that kind of takes that off the table for right now
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.240]   in terms of working or getting a job.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.600]   So I kind of just wanted to point that out,
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.360]   to kind of just go back to the,
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.920]   given these options of like,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.640]   if selling one and having like 50,000 net
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   or versus keeping the asset,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.040]   but having to sell Bitcoin that I own
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.000]   in order to have, to pay off all the debts, right?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.120]   This is net of the $150,000 of debt.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.520]   Just trying to get some insight on your recommendations
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.400]   aside from getting a job.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.200]   - All right, I'll answer that directly,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.440]   but let me just finish getting the job
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.720]   'cause I really think that's the best solution, all right?
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.800]   The other thing would be, I would,
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.480]   if you're still current as a pharmacist
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.760]   in the United States,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.120]   I would commute to the United States for a couple of weeks
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.920]   to try to do relief work for other pharmacists.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.280]   Or I would say, honey, listen,
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.040]   I'm so glad to be married to you.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.480]   Let me go and work for six months in the United States
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.320]   and I'll come and see you on long weekends.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   But you do need to, you need to fix your financial problem.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.520]   And so I want, so you know me,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.440]   I wanna encourage people to be together.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.920]   I want you to be together with your wife.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.640]   I want her to be together with you.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.840]   Obviously, you gotta be careful
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.320]   with regard to immigration stuff,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.560]   making sure that you're complying
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.480]   with whatever's necessary for the immigration,
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.560]   for you to be together long-term.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.080]   But when you make a mess, sometimes you gotta fix it.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.100]   And it's gonna be easier for you to fix it now
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.040]   than to fix it five years from now.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.600]   And so if you can avoid selling assets
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.320]   that you wouldn't otherwise sell,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.400]   and if you can put in a year or two of hard work
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   with some separation, that's gonna be okay.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.280]   And how do I strike the right tone?
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.560]   In the modern world, we are so fixated on our lifestyle
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.480]   and what we want that in many cases,
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.520]   we have forgotten how to sacrifice.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.080]   I'll give just two stories as an example.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.040]   One of my favorites was, a few years ago,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.320]   I was reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder series
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.540]   with my children.
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.640]   And there's a part in the series,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.500]   I think it's on the banks of Plum Creek,
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.480]   where the Pa, the father of the story,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.680]   their entire farm is eaten by locusts
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.840]   and all their crops are destroyed.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.640]   But of course, he's got four children
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.200]   that he's got to take care of,
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.460]   and a wife that he's got to take care of,
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.200]   and he's got debts from a house that he's built,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.480]   and things like that.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.920]   So here he goes, and he puts on his boots,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.680]   and he left his family at home,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.580]   and he literally walked until he found work.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.800]   And he walked, I think it was something like 200 miles away,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.160]   250, 300 miles, and he didn't see his family
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.520]   for an entire season until he was able to earn enough
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.840]   to pay off his debts and to fix his problem.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.220]   That's historically normal in many places.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.040]   It's also historically normal even within our lifetime.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.400]   When my parents were married, my dad was in the military.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.000]   And so during the first few years of their marriage,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.900]   he was shipped off in the Navy
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.920]   for six-month cruises at a time.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.520]   And so he was gone for 18 months
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.440]   out of the first probably 24, 30 months of their marriage,
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.520]   something like that.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.680]   Now, nobody thinks that's a good plan long-term,
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   and I wanna intentionally make decisions to avoid that.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.040]   So if we were talking and you didn't have the situation
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.640]   and you said, "All right, well, I'm considering doing this,"
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.120]   and I would say, "No, you wanna be with your wife.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   "You wanna be together with her.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.360]   "Absolutely, that's what you should be doing,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.680]   "is newlyweds."
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.420]   But I also recommend that. - Okay, thank you, thank you.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.260]   - Go ahead. - Mm-hmm.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.500]   - Sure. - Mm-hmm, okay.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.820]   Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.580]   So we've been together for two years,
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.900]   and it's always been long-distance
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.260]   because of visa issues and what have you.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.380]   So a big part of it.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.500]   And also because I had some real estate,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.740]   some bad investments, and had to go.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.420]   I actually went back to work,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.900]   and went back for about a year and worked.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.940]   And recently, after getting married, I was like,
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.760]   "Okay, this is the time to finally be together."
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.420]   Since for the two years that we've been dating,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.120]   we're now over, slightly over,
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.620]   we've only physically been together
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.100]   maybe like three or four months.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.860]   So it just seemed kind of-- - Okay.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.540]   - Ridiculous to-- - I understand.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.560]   - Get married, and then, "I'm gonna leave you, honey.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.700]   "Here you go, goodbye."
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.140]   - Okay, all right, so I'll move on.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.300]   I think I've said my piece.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.740]   I just wanna be complete in order to emphasize it.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.180]   - Oh, no, no, no. - If I woke up in your shoes,
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.780]   I would sell the house, take the $50,000,
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   use that to cover, to pay down some of the debts,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.620]   and then I would get-- - No, no, no, no.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.260]   I'm sorry, so if I sold that flip,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.260]   and after I refinance one of my houses,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.460]   and sell off one of them,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.300]   this would be, all the debt would be paid off.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.940]   That $50K would be net positive, no debt,
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.840]   as well as the Bitcoin, that positive 50 to 60K
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.260]   would be positive after paying off all of the 150K in debt.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.220]   And that money leftover would be for a wedding,
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.140]   and for me to live off of,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.020]   and try to figure out what the next steps are,
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.180]   as well as pay for all the legal fees
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.100]   for us getting residency in both directions.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.740]   - Sure, then I think that's the move.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.620]   I would keep the Bitcoin,
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.460]   and it's not because I'm making a bet
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.940]   on Bitcoin versus real estate, although, who knows?
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.380]   It's because I would rather have the money be in the IRA.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.060]   Because if something happens,
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.780]   and you get behind on your credit cards,
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.660]   your IRA should be exempt from the claims of creditors,
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.580]   whereas the houses are subject to the claims of creditors.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.500]   So if you know that these credit card companies,
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.300]   if I get behind with them, they're gonna sue me,
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.260]   and they're gonna take my houses anyway,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.420]   but they can't get at the money in my IRA,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.220]   depending on how that works,
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.340]   I don't know where they sue you,
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.140]   but the IRA laws are different from every state,
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:44.980]   I'm not gonna go into that.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   But just conceptually--
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.740]   - Would it make a difference if the houses
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.020]   weren't in single-member LLCs, each one individually?
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.980]   - No, because you own the LLCs.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.780]   And then you're gonna ask me, well, wait a second,
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.380]   what if I move LLC membership units,
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.260]   and I'm not going down that road because it's immoral?
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.740]   Not because it couldn't be done,
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.940]   but because hiding money from creditors,
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.900]   when you have the ability to pay them, is an immoral action.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.060]   If you have the ability to sell a house,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.640]   and pay off the debt, then that's what you should do.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.020]   So I'm gonna be defensive in my planning,
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.020]   and I'm not criticizing you, I'm just going,
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.700]   that's where most people's minds are going.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.180]   Let me explain how I shoot through this.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.940]   If you come to me, and you have $150,000 of debt,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.120]   and you get diagnosed with cancer,
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.220]   and now you're fighting cancer for the next five years,
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.340]   then I'm gonna tell you, stop paying your credit cards,
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.820]   and focus on getting well, because I'm okay with that,
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.660]   because that's the legal contract
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.740]   between you and the credit card company,
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.760]   and you don't have the ability to work
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.460]   because you're fighting cancer.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.180]   And so, I'm not opposed to getting behind on credit cards.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.660]   I have many times given people advice, stop paying,
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.900]   but you stop paying when you can't afford it,
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.060]   when you don't have any money,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.220]   and your children are going hungry
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.780]   because you're paying the credit cards.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.280]   I'm not opposed to bankruptcy.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.940]   Bankruptcy is for when you cannot pay your creditors,
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.960]   and I think it's morally permissible to declare bankruptcy
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.980]   in a situation that you can't get out of.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.940]   However, what is not morally permissible
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.700]   is for you to have assets that could be sold,
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.720]   and not sell those assets
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.080]   to pay the claims of your creditors.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.100]   That would be immoral,
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.740]   because it would be stealing from your creditors to do that.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.580]   So, what I'm saying is, I'm willing to play defense,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.660]   and say, keep the money in your IRA,
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:38.000]   because if things get bad, you're still protected there,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.340]   but I think you're better off selling the houses,
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.740]   and you'll have a lower tax rate.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.320]   You'll sell the houses, you'll pay off the debts,
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.660]   and then you'll be free of it,
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.540]   and you'll still have the protected money in the IRA.
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.940]   So, I'm trying to shoot the middle,
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.260]   and not be stupid, and just say,
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.060]   oh, let's not take any asset protection planning
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.940]   into account, but also not to give any hint
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.300]   that we're gonna play games
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.000]   with people that you owe money to.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.500]   - Well, I fully have the intention of paying off my debt.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.940]   Either one of these solutions would net me positive
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.180]   after paying off all my debt.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.060]   So, that was never about,
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.620]   I was just wondering about the asset protection,
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.460]   but I see what you're saying
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.340]   about keeping it in the retirement account,
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.220]   because those are so, God forbid, in the future,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.020]   if I ever were to have to declare bankruptcy,
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.260]   then that money would be protected
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.540]   from the claims of creditors, where they can go after.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.740]   So, basically, you're kind of implying
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.660]   that the other houses,
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.220]   even though they're in single-member LLCs,
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.100]   that they could potentially pierce the corporate shield,
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.460]   and seize those assets, if I'm understanding it right.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.920]   - I am not a practicing bankruptcy lawyer,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.580]   so know that first and foremost.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.320]   However, I've read a lot of books and articles
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.260]   from those who are.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.580]   So, first and foremost, from an asset protection standpoint,
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.920]   single-member LLCs may not be useless,
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.740]   but they are certainly not ironclad.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.780]   That's the first thing.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.660]   So, one of the standard pieces of advice
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.300]   when you read their books is,
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.780]   you always need to make certain
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.740]   that all of your companies have multiple members,
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.200]   and they need to be multiple members
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.220]   who aren't seen as a unit.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   So, if you really have a high need for high asset protection,
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.060]   then it's not just gonna be you and your wife
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.500]   owning the LLC,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.960]   but rather, it's gonna be you
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.120]   and some unrelated parties also,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.340]   because there is a much higher level of respect
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.260]   for a multi-member LLC,
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.480]   where innocent parties can be hurt,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.600]   versus a single-member LLC,
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.380]   which is just a shell that was put in place
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:35.380]   for the purposes of trying to keep money from creditors.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.880]   The other aspect to it is just that,
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.220]   anytime you're sued, you and all of your entities
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.560]   are going to be sued.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.900]   So, you're gonna be sued,
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.820]   and all of your LLCs are gonna be sued,
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.300]   and then you would have to demonstrate to the court
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.980]   why your LLCs are not you,
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.460]   and why the court should protect those assets.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.380]   And that's just not how most real estate investors do it.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.260]   So, I don't think that there is a significant,
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.420]   and again, I'm not a lawyer,
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.460]   but I don't think there's a significant
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.920]   asset protection benefit of your properties
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.220]   being in single-member LLCs, generally speaking.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:15.100]   I think that maybe there's some opportunity for it,
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.240]   but maybe it does work as if, let's say,
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.120]   a tenant sues you, maybe.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.920]   But in general, the way the US courts work
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.740]   is they want people to pay bills,
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.380]   and they want debtors to pay creditors.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.020]   And so, if it ever feels like
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.060]   there's not a genuine, legitimate purpose for the planning
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.740]   beyond asset protection,
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.900]   it seems like the asset protection schemes
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.060]   pretty well fall apart most of the time.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.580]   So, you gotta work really hard
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.980]   to create that genuine business purpose,
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.460]   and that's not generally what real estate investors do
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.640]   when they just set up a bunch of single-member LLCs.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.140]   By the way, there are other reasons
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.860]   other than asset protection to have single-member LLCs.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.140]   So, I'm not saying don't set up LLCs.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.260]   What I'm saying is that I would not count on that myself.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.380]   - No, I understand, and I'll be honest.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.860]   You're spot on, and as a real estate investor,
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.140]   I'm not the best record keeper,
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.260]   and if, God forbid, there was a lawsuit or what have you,
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.700]   I would imagine they would probably pretty easily
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.420]   be able to pierce this corporate shield.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.180]   So, I appreciate that advice.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.020]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.060]   I've heard your other insights in the past
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.900]   about using retirement accounts
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.260]   and their protection from creditors.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.220]   So, that is very insightful.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.660]   - Can you get, last comment, back to the job.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.580]   I would look for an online job, working online.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.380]   The schedule of living in Europe
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.900]   and working online in the United States
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.580]   is a wonderful schedule.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.540]   It would allow you to be physically present with your wife,
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.800]   and every dollar that you earn online,
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.500]   especially if there's some flexibility with it,
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:52.320]   is a bit of property that you don't have to sell.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.500]   So, obviously, you have a plan here
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.160]   with selling the property that would work,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.020]   give you the money to pay everything off,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.860]   but I would just say that if you could have a job online,
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.780]   even if you're making $70,000 a year,
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.540]   over the next year, that's a huge number,
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.260]   and that may keep you from selling a property
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.020]   that you wouldn't otherwise want to sell.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.300]   So, I won't beat that drum anymore,
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.980]   but to me, the obvious answer to the problem
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.700]   is sell what you have to sell to stay current,
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:22.400]   but just get a job and work the job
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.820]   so that you can manage your property part-time
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.180]   and put all of the income from the job
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.540]   to paying off the debt.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.660]   And then, a year from now,
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.980]   you would still own potentially more assets
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.900]   while also fixing the problem.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.320]   All right, good enough?
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.900]   - Yeah, yes, well, just one, I guess, real quick,
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.500]   follow-up question.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.420]   So, if you would suggest getting a job,
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.740]   but would you recommend as well?
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.700]   Because it probably won't be a highly paid job
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.460]   versus like a reading and acquiring skills
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.860]   and new skills and talents, for example.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.340]   Would you not go that route or recommend or advise that route?
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.780]   - If I were in your shoes, I would try to see
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.020]   if I could do relief work for pharmacists
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.060]   who want to go on vacation.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.540]   I don't know anything about that,
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.340]   but that kind of work, I would guess,
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.380]   is probably out there.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.900]   And there's a lot of pharmacists who are overworked,
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.260]   and if they could hire a qualified pharmacist
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:15.020]   to come in and run the pharmacy for a few weeks
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.300]   so they could get a break, that would be my first thing.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.840]   That would take you away from your wife,
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.860]   but if it's a couple weeks out of a month,
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.500]   that's what I would do.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.500]   But other than that, I would just say,
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.220]   look for anything online that you could,
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.660]   anything that you could get.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.980]   I don't think it makes sense for you to work
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.600]   for $15,000 a year.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.700]   That would be dumb.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.980]   But you should be, with your training and your education,
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.560]   you should be qualified for a variety of things.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.360]   So I would just work really hard to see what I could do
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.080]   or what I could get qualified for very quickly.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.780]   So hopefully that starts, and congratulations
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.780]   on your marriage, and I hope that,
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.940]   call me back and let's celebrate
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.460]   when you get all that debt paid off.
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.100]   Samuel in Colorado, welcome to the show.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.020]   How can I serve you today?
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.620]   (chair squeaking)
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.660]   - Hello.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.720]   - Hello, Samuel, and Samuel's chair.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.420]   You have a chair almost as squeaky as mine.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.460]   - Oh no, I just don't hear it anymore
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.560]   'cause I'm here all the time.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.020]   - Well, I heard it very loudly.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.700]   Go ahead, Samuel, it's okay.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.140]   - Yeah, so I called two weeks ago,
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.520]   and you must not have heard my chair then,
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.460]   but I called on the topic of career and income planning.
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:26.460]   I'm 31 years old, and the topic of early retiring at 35,
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:31.340]   and you provided a response of possibly scale that back,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.860]   40, 45, and I think that's a great response.
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.300]   And I just wanted to kind of evolve that
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.540]   into a related topic.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.620]   And so what we talked about, yeah,
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.460]   I'm in public accounting, I'm in auditing,
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.740]   and I'm a senior manager.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.740]   So, and you mentioned like one thing you mentioned
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.600]   was you could reduce your income,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.340]   like calculate what you would need
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.140]   if you just took your current net worth
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.500]   and figured out how long it would take
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.760]   under an interest rate assumption
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.840]   to get to what you need under the 4% rule,
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.340]   you could reduce your work.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.740]   So my topic today is kind of sunk cost fallacy
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.540]   and how to think about that in terms of career and income,
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.100]   because thinking about it,
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:25.060]   I think sunk cost takes away some aspects,
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.020]   but it doesn't take away other aspects.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:31.180]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.900]   so yeah, I'm a CPA in Colorado and California.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.940]   I've been in public accounting for almost 10 years
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.100]   and studied that in school.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.120]   So in my mind, sunk cost would say
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.420]   what you've done in the past
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.940]   shouldn't impact your choice in the future,
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   but how it would impact it is,
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.460]   if I were to be teleported to where I am right now,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.300]   all the experience I have, all the certifications I have,
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.620]   I take those with me.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:00.900]   So that would impact the decision,
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.900]   but I shouldn't say because I've been in this career
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.140]   for nine years, I need to stick with it.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:10.180]   So then to kind of narrow it down to the specific question,
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:13.780]   I mentioned that public accounting has some downsides
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.740]   relating to more hours and more commitment,
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.860]   but at the same time,
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:23.220]   it may be the easiest way to get the highest rate of income
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.540]   for the foreseeable future,
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.220]   since I have experience in it,
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.820]   compared to your example of,
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.140]   just random example of a flight attendant.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.500]   So I could definitely live for a long time
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.200]   with making less income,
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.100]   but how do you balance the sunk cost thing,
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.440]   the career path you've gone down
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:45.900]   versus just totally, potentially throwing that away
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.900]   and going down something
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.740]   for the purpose of work-life balance?
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:54.500]   - Let me try to answer it with a question first.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.500]   So as I mentioned on our previous Friday Q&A show,
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.220]   there are a couple of exercises
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.420]   that I have found to be really effective
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.060]   in answering these questions with private consulting.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.780]   The first exercise is the one that I described to you.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.280]   And that exercise specifically is for me
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.640]   to take your net worth,
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.280]   as you've already repeated back to me,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.240]   take your net worth,
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.880]   figure out what net worth you need to live on,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.060]   and then just assume that you stopped saving money
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.060]   and then project it forward to the future
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.120]   to figure out when you could afford to retire
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.600]   based upon how much you've saved.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.640]   And then just say, "Hey, you just gotta live a job.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.240]   "You gotta work something now over the next decade
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.720]   "or whatever it takes, two decades, doesn't matter.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.780]   "And you can't save any money,
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.800]   "but you can't spend any of your assets."
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.880]   And so that's what I mentioned to you last time.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.400]   And I usually will do the calculations,
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.040]   but of course, you can do that yourself.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.600]   Now, in working on this,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.440]   I also eventually wrote two other questions
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.160]   that I find I frequently use.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.400]   And let me articulate these questions to you
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.160]   because I believe they'll be helpful
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.840]   and they're kind of games.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.640]   And I'm gonna do the first one a little faster
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.000]   'cause what I wanna get to is the second one,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.960]   but in my experience, they work better.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:16.520]   So play this with me and I want you to play a game, okay?
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.360]   Game number one.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.080]   I want you to pretend
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.240]   that you have just received a phone call.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:31.200]   And the guy on the other end of the line says,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.280]   "Listen, Samuel, I've got some sad news for you.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   "Your long-lost great-aunt Mildred has just passed away."
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.000]   And of course, you feel sad
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.160]   because you have very pleasant memories
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.800]   of long-lost great-aunt Mildred.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.240]   You're not too sad because she was a very old woman
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.040]   and you haven't seen her in 35 years,
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:52.920]   or excuse me, you're 31.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.880]   You haven't seen her in 25 years
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.760]   because she's been gone for a long time.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.800]   But of course, you're sad to hear
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.320]   that great-aunt Mildred has passed away.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.840]   He continues and he says, "But there's some good news.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.760]   "And the good news is this,
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.720]   "that great-aunt Mildred has left you, Samuel,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.080]   "as the sole beneficiary of her estate."
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.880]   And great-aunt Mildred was very wealthy.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.360]   The reason you haven't seen great-aunt Mildred
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.560]   in 25 years, however,
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:29.080]   is simply that she fell in love
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.040]   with a Norwegian prince
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.840]   and they eloped to Switzerland
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.400]   where they have lived for the last 25 years.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   And so years ago, great-aunt Mildred
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.640]   renounced her American citizenship
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:45.600]   and she decided that she hated the United States.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.800]   So she inherited all of her husband's wealth
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.520]   from his family wealth
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.680]   and they put all of the money into a tax haven.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.520]   It's in an offshore trust in the Cook Islands.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.680]   And the attorney explains to you
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.800]   that since you're an American,
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.480]   he can't actually give you the money
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.840]   and you can't be a trustee on the trust.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:06.080]   But tomorrow morning in the mail,
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.560]   you're gonna receive a FedEx envelope.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.760]   And that FedEx envelope
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.720]   has a black American Express card in it.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.880]   And what you can do is you can swipe that card
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.120]   for anything that you want, anywhere in the world.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.200]   And at the end of every single month
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.680]   for the rest of your life,
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.800]   that card will be paid off.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.160]   Now, ignore the technicalities.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.040]   I'm just focusing on the, you know,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.760]   ignore the taxes and all that stuff
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.120]   'cause I have to say this to you, the accountant.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.720]   Question is this,
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.240]   tomorrow morning when you receive that FedEx envelope
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.320]   with a black American Express card in it,
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.240]   what will you do and how will you live?
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:53.040]   - I would quit my job and start going back to church,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.320]   build a bunch of relationships,
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.960]   do a lot of skiing and rock climbing, never work again.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.800]   - Okay.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.280]   What else?
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.880]   - Hmm, never thought beyond that.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.560]   Like along what lines?
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   - Anything you want.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.840]   - Just financial?
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.520]   I mean, I don't have big financial goals.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.360]   - Let's say that you do that.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.480]   Let's say you do that for the next three years straight.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.640]   You're skiing every winter,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.360]   rock climbing all summer, three years straight.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.160]   What would you do after three years?
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:31.160]   - I think more of the same.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.520]   I mean, it's a lifelong pursuit, right?
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.640]   Like there's people who rock climb
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.520]   like Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.300]   I'm so far from achieving that.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:43.880]   You know, it's a lifetime away at the rate I'm doing it.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.440]   You know, skiing, jumping a hundred foot cliffs,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.480]   like it would take a lifetime
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.320]   to build that level of proficiency.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.040]   - Okay, great.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.280]   All right, so I'm gonna pause there.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.920]   Later, go back and think about that question.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.160]   Replay the little game that I said
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.600]   and just really think about that.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.040]   And what I want you to do is I want you
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.240]   to think about it in two phases.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.760]   So it sounds to me like your consumption,
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.220]   you're pretty clear, you know, your goals are simple.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.360]   I want to ski and rock climb.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.020]   That's what I want to do.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.560]   For anyone else who's listening and doing the exercise,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.240]   some people have a long list of things
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.640]   they would buy immediately
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.240]   and a whole bunch of stuff that they would do for a year.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.480]   Okay, fine, write all that stuff down,
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.000]   but then fast forward five years
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.620]   and assume that you've just done nothing
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.020]   but this thing for the last five years.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.440]   What would you do then?
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.040]   Because what I think most people find
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.040]   is that once they get out of their system the recreation,
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.680]   then they're looking for something
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.120]   that is more constructive
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.360]   than pure self-indulgent recreation.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.440]   When I was in high school and college,
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.160]   I taught wakeboarding and water skiing.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.320]   And that job plus a different job cured me forever
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.480]   of thinking that doing something fun all day every day
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.360]   is where it's at.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.740]   Because what happens is you enjoy your recreation the most
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.760]   when it's a respite or an interruption
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.520]   from something else that you're doing.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.120]   But when all you do all day every day is recreate,
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.200]   then it may lose some of its attraction.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.280]   Now, maybe not, I don't know.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.820]   I've never been a rock climber maybe,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.480]   and there's probably lots of guys out there who would say,
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.400]   "Nope, I'm ready to do this for 20 years."
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.760]   So think carefully about the question.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.720]   But let's go on to game number two, all right?
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.620]   Here's game two.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.360]   - I see your point, sorry.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.640]   I would definitely pursue something that I could do
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.720]   because I wanted to, not because I had to.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.600]   - Right, so that's what I want you to think about.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.160]   I want you to assume however long you need.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.800]   If it's one year or five years,
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.280]   you're living in a fancy RV, rock climbing,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.480]   skiing nonstop, but then fast forward.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.240]   Imagine yourself at 40.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.000]   You know, what would you wanna do at 40?
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Recognizing that you've got this black Amex card still.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.040]   You can do anything you want.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.160]   We'll come back to that in a moment.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.000]   All right, let's play game number two.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.720]   I want you to pretend
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.740]   that you've just received a phone call.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.860]   And this time, the guy on the other end of the line
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.820]   is a guy that you know.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.820]   Now, for whatever reason, even though you're a CPA
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.620]   and a public accountant and an auditor,
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.700]   for whatever reason, this is your accountant on the line.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.160]   I always use accountant 'cause it works for my game.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.540]   So you just gotta play along with me here,
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.360]   even though you're an accountant.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.940]   So this is your accountant, John, on the line.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.540]   And John has filed your taxes for you
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.620]   for the last 20 years of your life,
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.180]   since you earned your first paycheck at 11 years old.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.020]   And John says to you, "Listen, Samuel,
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.540]   "I don't know how to say this,
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.880]   "but I am standing at my office window,
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.620]   "and I'm looking down in the parking lot,
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.680]   "and there's a bunch of scary-looking guys with guns
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.920]   "getting out of dark SUVs, putting on blue windbreakers
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.900]   "with three letters on the back.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.100]   "And I know for a fact that they are here for me.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.040]   "And the reason they're here for me, Samuel,
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.860]   "is that I, because I've been doing your taxes
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.960]   "for the last 20 years,
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.280]   "I have been filing false tax returns in your name
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.060]   "with the IRS for the last 20 years.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.180]   "And I have been embezzling money from the IRS."
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.580]   And of course, Samuel, you yourself
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.860]   are entirely morally innocent in this sordid affair.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.380]   You had no idea what I was doing.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.360]   I concealed it from you.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.160]   But what you don't know, Samuel,
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.840]   is that there is a very little-known law.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.540]   It is in the Internal Revenue Code,
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:18.140]   section 674, subsection G,
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.860]   subsection 1, subsection A7,
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:24.000]   that says that if somebody embezzles money
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.300]   from the IRS in your name,
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.100]   whether or not you know anything about it,
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.300]   you are guilty of it, and you have to pay back
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.460]   the full amount of money that has been embezzled.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.900]   And so, Samuel, by the end of today,
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.400]   since you were a client of mine,
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.500]   again, even though you're morally innocent,
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.100]   this rule exists, and by the end of today,
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:44.580]   all of your assets are going to be seized by the IRS.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.940]   All of your bank accounts are going to be seized.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.780]   All of your retirement accounts are going to be seized.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.300]   And what's more, you can still live in the house
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.720]   that you're living in, that's not seized today,
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.900]   but what's more is that for the rest of your life,
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.760]   all of your wages are going to be garnished
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.460]   at the end of every month.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.620]   At the end of every single month of your life,
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.660]   for the rest of your life,
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.780]   any money that's left over in your bank account
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.740]   is going to be taken by the IRS.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.520]   Even your Social Security is seized.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:23.500]   So what that means, Samuel, is you will have to work
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.540]   for the rest of your life.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.860]   You will never be able to accumulate money
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.300]   because you owe the IRS a bajillion dollars.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.660]   You can still work, you can still earn money,
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.860]   but you will never be able to accumulate wealth
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.660]   because at the end of every month, the IRS will take it.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.500]   So if that happened, what would you do
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.620]   and how would you live?
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:53.020]   - Well, eventually I would transition,
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.300]   similar to the last example, to a job.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.020]   Yeah, it was better for lifestyle.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:05.060]   And I mean, see, that's what I have to,
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:09.140]   you frequently say, when people come to you and say,
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.500]   like, I need a job, it's like, you can't help with that.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.500]   You need to know your goals and know what you wanna do.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.940]   So the easy thing to think about is,
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.420]   something in my current industry,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.300]   either work in the industry,
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.620]   do like some of the seasonal jobs you've discussed,
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.660]   or work for the government is a compelling one
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.420]   'cause it seems chill.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:33.720]   But there's the alternative position of saying,
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.940]   I'll do something really chill, like flight attendant
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:41.020]   or something really seasonal, work at 7-Eleven,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.180]   be a farmer for part of the year.
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.020]   So I'd have to really think through that.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.780]   And that's part of why my question is difficult,
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.860]   because I don't know what that alternative answer would be,
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.420]   but I know it would be different than what I'm doing now.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.740]   - Right, and that's what I want you to think about.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.620]   This is my way of answering your question
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.220]   about how do I think about the sunk cost fallacy.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.060]   The reason I wrote those two games the way that I did
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.220]   is that I generally work with people like you,
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.380]   who are good accumulators of wealth.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.140]   And what I've discovered is that there are two ditches
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.980]   that prodigious accumulators of wealth go into.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.660]   Ditch number one is they think nonstop
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.460]   about what they can buy and what they can do,
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.420]   and that's what they're going for.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:29.820]   And so I try to give full, that credit card,
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:30.820]   the idea is, okay, listen,
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.400]   you can buy everything that you want.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.240]   I've covered it all.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.580]   Let's write all that lifestyle down.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.820]   Now, you've bought everything that you want.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.660]   Now what?
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.120]   All right, what's the point?
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.320]   And I'll give you as much leash to run on as you want.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.740]   Buy everything, make the whole list,
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.660]   make the giant purchasing list.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.380]   But when we do that, what we realize,
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.120]   most people, not everyone,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.740]   is that purchasing list is not actually all that long.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.060]   Like, okay, I wanna buy a new car,
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.100]   but most people don't want 33 cars.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.860]   They just want a new car, you know?
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:02.660]   And so let's make the list of all the stuff
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.580]   that you would do, and then let's say,
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:08.020]   okay, what would you do if now working has no point,
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.300]   because you're not working to buy more stuff.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.260]   You can buy everything.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.580]   And so let's try to figure that out.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.960]   The second question I wrote was to try to get at people
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.680]   who save too much money,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.500]   because there's a lot of people that save money.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.540]   And what they do is they view it as,
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.580]   well, I'm gonna invest,
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.060]   sorry, back, real quick,
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:25.900]   following the second question.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.340]   The first question also is that what people do
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.300]   who are prodigious accumulators of wealth
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.020]   is they're always focused on the next investment.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.800]   And, you know, okay, I've got seven houses,
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.660]   but I'm gonna get 11.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.620]   My goal is to get 11.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.840]   Well, why?
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.220]   Well, I don't know, but it just sounds good.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.340]   It sounds better to have 10 houses than it does to have seven.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.380]   Just, you know, I want $5 million in net worth
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.220]   instead of 3 million.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.180]   Why?
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:49.980]   And so they get fixated on accumulating money, money, money,
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.440]   thinking that they actually wanna spend it,
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.840]   but in reality, it's just an addiction
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.620]   to making more investments.
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.300]   All right, but now to the second one.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.580]   The second one is to say, all right, you're saving money,
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:05.580]   but you're so fixated on this idea that I don't wanna work.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.000]   And this is what I mentioned to you a couple of weeks ago
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.520]   is that, you know, I just don't wanna work.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.200]   I wanna be 35 years old and I don't wanna work.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.160]   Okay, fine.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.520]   Okay, great.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.880]   But now let's take that away and say you can't,
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.080]   so you're focused, laser focused on early retirement.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.520]   Accumulate, accumulate, accumulate.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.480]   Nothing wrong with accumulating,
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.780]   but let's figure out what you would do
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.140]   if you couldn't accumulate.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.040]   And let's imagine life in that situation.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   So if you genuinely play those games,
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.600]   you'll come up with something that's different.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.780]   Now, everyone is gonna have something different.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.100]   One guy in your situation,
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.920]   it would be pretty obvious to him
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.760]   that if he gets a job as a ski instructor in the wintertime
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.800]   and a climbing instructor and guide in the summertime,
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.160]   then he would be pretty well living his dream lifestyle.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.080]   And that'd be pretty obvious to that guy.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.680]   Now, for me, like what would I do?
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.980]   - You say you'll never join the Navy,
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.800]   never live on a submarine or power a ship
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.480]   with nuclear energy.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.180]   Joining the Navy sounds crazy, saying never actually is.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.260]   Learn why at Navy.com.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.060]   America's Navy, forged by the sea.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.220]   - I know in an instant,
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.720]   I would go and get a PhD and be a college professor,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.740]   'cause to me, that is the perfect dream job.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:19.060]   It has the perfect encapsulation of intellectual stimulation,
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.300]   enough money to live comfortably on,
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.180]   good control over schedule,
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.820]   and I would love the social
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.860]   and intellectual environment of that.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.780]   But everyone has a different thing.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.460]   And so I want you to take away the idea
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.320]   that you can just somehow escape if you save enough money
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.520]   and figure out what you would do if you escaped too,
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.980]   and consider that pretty deeply.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.260]   So then now back to the sunk cost fallacy.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:45.280]   The sunk cost fallacy is basic,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.520]   I think is something that you need to recognize
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.460]   and then acknowledge, I'm 31 years old,
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:54.060]   and I have tons of options before me.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.980]   And the idea that at 31, you would say,
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.940]   well, I can't go and retrain for something else
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.100]   or go in a different direction
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.940]   'cause I have these degrees and designations
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.100]   and experience to me is crazy.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.780]   If you knew that you would want to go
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.120]   and be involved in this, whatever this is,
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.100]   then go and just pursue it.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.320]   Now, there is an element of intelligence,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.060]   maybe you're two years away from having your house paid off,
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.540]   and that would provide you with a really wonderful thing,
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.420]   and you need to do two years of training anyway
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.580]   to move to this new career.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:24.540]   Well, obviously be smart about it,
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.500]   but it's just mostly a matter of saying
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.980]   the past doesn't exist, it really doesn't,
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.260]   it's dead and gone, and the most intelligent thing
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.700]   for any man to be doing at any stage of his life
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.420]   is to be going as vigorously as possible
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.980]   in the direction that he thinks he wants to go.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.100]   And related, one more kind of comment,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.180]   the caller before you talked about
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.820]   my comment on getting married.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.580]   One thing I have learned also is this,
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.780]   and I try to bring this into,
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.980]   basically I think it applies to every area of life.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.380]   If you think you wanna go in a different direction,
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.700]   I may have said this two weeks ago,
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.380]   but forgive me if I'm repeating.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.540]   If you think you wanna go in a different direction,
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.540]   the best move is go in that direction as hard and fast today
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.980]   as you possibly could.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.260]   I've thought and thought and thought about this situation,
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.700]   and I can't come up with any real scenario
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.940]   in which it makes sense to wait
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.580]   when you know a direction that you might wanna go in.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.340]   And so, again, I think I'm repeating,
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.500]   but let me just do it even so.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.460]   If you're gonna move across the country and you say,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.340]   I don't wanna live in Colorado anymore,
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.780]   I wanna move to Maine.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.580]   Well, you should move to Maine today,
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.780]   as close to today as you can.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.700]   Because if you get to Maine
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.780]   and you discover that you hate it,
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.460]   then now you can instantly move back to Colorado
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.500]   six months from now,
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.740]   and now the whole idea
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.820]   that I might wanna go to Maine is gone.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.020]   And now I'm just totally happy and content in Colorado.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.380]   On the other hand, if you get to Maine and you love it,
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.860]   and it's obvious that that was the right move for you,
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.740]   then you're perfectly in great shape.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.620]   And now you get to spend years and years more in Maine
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:02.260]   than you otherwise would do.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.860]   So bringing it to careers.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.980]   If you knew that what you would really love to do
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.140]   would be to go and work as a journalist
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.340]   for a rock climbing magazine,
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.920]   then what you should do is as close to today as possible,
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.820]   go and get that job.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.780]   And then if you love it,
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.180]   you'll be thrilled that you did it
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.420]   because now you get to spend more years
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.920]   doing the thing that you love.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.380]   If you hate it, you'll be so glad that you did it now.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.620]   So you can turn around and go back on bended knee
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.460]   to your boss and say,
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.140]   "Hey boss, can I have my really cool auditing job back
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.940]   where I make all this money and it's really great?"
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.260]   And they'll give you the job back.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.860]   And now you're not sitting on,
[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.460]   wondering if the grass is actually green
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.860]   or on the other side or not.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.620]   So the key is developing the vision
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.780]   of where you might wanna go
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.580]   and then pursuing it aggressively.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.760]   And at 31, I think it makes the most sense for you
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.180]   to try to move in the direction of that thing
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.900]   that you would do based upon those scenarios
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.100]   that I described.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.300]   And it may take you a while to discover it or to create it.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.820]   And in the meantime, you should be living cheap,
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:05.120]   earning as much as you can, saving as much as you can,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.980]   still working towards financial independence.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.700]   But if you discover that thing that you want to do,
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.660]   then go towards it as quickly as possible
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.820]   because you can always go back to auditing.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.980]   - Yeah, thank you so much.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.080]   That's exactly it.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.540]   And it's just because I don't know what that thing is.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:27.980]   So if I knew what it was, I would definitely do that.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.940]   For example, some of my roommates do engineering
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.620]   and I often look at that and say, "Oh, it's so casual.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.120]   They never work weekends.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.540]   They always get off work on time."
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.220]   But that's where sunk cost comes in.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.240]   I don't wanna take five or six more years of schooling
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.820]   because I don't think it's truly
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.700]   that I wanna do engineering.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.860]   It's just that you can always see
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   your grass is greener on the other side.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.460]   On one of your other podcasts,
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.700]   you interviewed someone who was talking
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:55.860]   about all these businesses.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.300]   One of them was an ATM machine.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.140]   And then just last night, I looked at it,
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.260]   and I'm like, "I never thought
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.420]   of starting an ATM machine business."
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.700]   And the more I looked into it, it has a lot of cons.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.940]   It's almost as much work as real estate.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.020]   So I'm just really skimming the surface
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.820]   and looking at what that thing would be.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.420]   I think that's the biggest challenge.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.940]   - Yeah, look at franchises
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.780]   because you have the money to buy a franchise.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:21.820]   And a franchise, well-managed,
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.620]   may give you the kind of freedom
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.980]   and flexibility you're looking for.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.420]   And it can provide for you with the income that you need
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.220]   that's a much higher return on investment
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.100]   that you can make with most other things.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.460]   It will require your attention,
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.660]   but you're probably well-suited to developing those skills
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.760]   in a fairly short period of time.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.840]   And you can use technology
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.260]   to provide you with a lot of benefit
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.300]   to a lot of what you're looking for.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.380]   So if you had some kind of franchise in Denver
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:57.300]   and you're up in the mountains and you've got your cameras
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.780]   and you've got your texting service with your employees
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.860]   and everything's good,
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.420]   you can always get back down to Denver
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:06.140]   in four or five hours or whatever it takes when you need to.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.900]   But in the meantime, you could have a business
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.460]   that's providing you with the kind of income
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.280]   that you might need.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.900]   So consider that because a lot of times
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.820]   some people have pretty clear dreams and ambitions
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.540]   of I really wanna do this other kind of work,
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.300]   but you may not have that.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.020]   So just think strategically and say,
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.660]   what kind of business would provide me with it?
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.500]   All right, love the question.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.700]   Feel free to continue calling in.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.020]   I've got three other calls on the line.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.020]   Let's go a little faster.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.420]   George in Florida, welcome to the show.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.720]   How can I serve you today?
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.180]   - Hey, Josh, good afternoon.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.740]   Well, I'm sure you're getting tired
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.260]   at this point of hearing this,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.820]   but I just wanna say thank you for everything you do.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.340]   And I really appreciate all the work you do
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.180]   and the way you analyze things.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.460]   And your work is so unique
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.620]   and is what separates from other financial
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:59.300]   experts out on the field.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.980]   So I just really wanted to say,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.380]   I appreciate everything you do
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.860]   and thank you for what you do.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.380]   And I hope you continue to do it
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:09.020]   as long as you enjoy, of course.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.020]   - I thank you for saying thank you and don't,
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.220]   no, I don't get tired of it
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.020]   because I get tired sometimes of doing the work
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.700]   and it's knowing that I may be useful to people.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.580]   I look around and all I see is how everyone else
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.180]   is better at everything than me
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.940]   and I get discouraged plenty of times.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.480]   And so people saying nice things
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.320]   and giving genuine insight into some way
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.700]   that I've served them is definitely fuel
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.980]   for my emotional gas tank.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.220]   So thank you, I appreciate it.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.380]   And I appreciate it.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.700]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.740]   - Appreciate it.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.060]   So I thought I had, well, maybe I still do,
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:46.060]   but it seems to be like a car purchasing question,
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.860]   but the more I think about it is it becomes more of like,
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.540]   how do I manage my goals?
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:56.340]   To give you the context, I'm 34 years old,
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:01.340]   I'm currently engaged and we are already saved the money.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.620]   My fiance and I already saved the money for the wedding
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.460]   and we're of course working towards our future,
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.900]   currently saving money to buy our next home
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.820]   and probably continue, we'll do so
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.020]   for maybe two or three more homes.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:22.060]   And one of the things, our cars are paid off
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:27.060]   and I'm trying to look and plan ahead.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:31.740]   And I'm estimating that we might need our next car
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.180]   in about six years from now.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.100]   And that gets me thinking, okay,
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.380]   we're currently saving about $2,000 every month,
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.220]   which we are putting on a high yield savings account.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.540]   And that's basically what's gonna fund our next goal,
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.500]   which would be primarily our primary goal
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.300]   is getting to our next property.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:57.300]   So we're saving money towards that.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   But then I am thinking, since I know that in about six years
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:07.460]   I'm gonna be needing to buy a car,
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.100]   and if I know, I don't know, or I estimate
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.580]   I'm gonna be spending about like 25, $30,000,
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.180]   whatever the cost that might be,
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:21.180]   would it be wise to start working towards that goal now?
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.460]   For example, putting aside,
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.900]   because the cars are paid off,
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.020]   so basically set aside like 200, $300 every month,
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.820]   perhaps putting it on an investment account
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.140]   so that it gains interest over the course of six years.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:41.140]   And when the time comes, being able to pay the car in cash
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.860]   without taking away from the bigger savings
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.540]   that we're using for our primary goal,
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.020]   which is getting on our next property.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.340]   So that's basically my question,
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.380]   'cause I'm in a point to where I,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:00.380]   should I just save the full 2000 and get to the house first?
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.020]   And then once we're in the house,
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.100]   kind of like save for the cars,
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.340]   but at the same time I wanna move on to the next property,
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.940]   so I don't wanna delay that as well.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:15.940]   So that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:21.780]   And because of course, you don't wanna put any money
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.980]   that you're gonna use in the relatively short term, right?
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.340]   In something risky, like I don't wanna,
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.860]   I'm putting it, the safest bet
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.580]   is to put in a high-yield savings for buying a house,
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.700]   because of course you're gonna be using that cash.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:41.300]   So you don't want the market to just erase all that.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.420]   - I understand the question.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:46.460]   Let me give you two viewpoints to choose between.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.220]   The short answer is gonna be anything you do is fine.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.860]   So you know that any plan that you do is fine.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.820]   So what I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna give you plans
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.740]   that ideas that I think are really compelling,
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.460]   and then maybe this will resonate with you.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.500]   And I'm stealing my own thunder from even the series
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.260]   that I'm doing right now on intelligent goals,
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.540]   because this one will be coming up later,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:06.840]   or the number two one I'm gonna tell you.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.860]   So first and foremost, for a guy like you
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:13.860]   who is earning income, sounds like you've got income,
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.220]   your wife's got income, you guys have lower expenses,
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.080]   you're accumulating properties, you're buying a house,
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.940]   you're working, you're on a plan.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:23.740]   Buying a car is basically a meaningless thing.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.700]   And I'm not saying that,
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.940]   what I'm saying is you can buy a car anytime.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.900]   You have a car, the car works fine.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.520]   Cars last basically for most people in the United States
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.220]   who drive on these pretty little roads
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.700]   that never tear your car to bits, your cars last forever.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.060]   Not literally forever, but your cars right now
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.740]   could probably last you for 20 years with no problem.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.700]   There's been so many advances in car design
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.540]   that cars last forever.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.660]   On any day in the United States, when you need another car,
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.700]   you can walk out and get yourself
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.820]   a perfectly reasonable car for 5,000 bucks
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.300]   that will drive you down the road
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.820]   and be safe and reliable and no problem at all.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.640]   Cars in the United States, good used cars,
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.940]   are so easy to come by that it's just laughable.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.980]   Now, in the $25,000 range,
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.860]   you can find those cars all the time,
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.940]   and there's no problem whatsoever.
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.420]   And the whole point of cars is kind of silly,
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.580]   meaning what I mean is that, okay, yes, we need them
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.820]   'cause the whole culture is built around them,
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.660]   but there's so many options that planning too far ahead
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:28.500]   for a car really is not a big deal.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:32.820]   If you need to save $2,000 a month in 12 months of savings,
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:37.820]   you can cover your, you can buy your $24,000 car.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.020]   So I'm not too worried about the car.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.180]   If my car breaks and I wanna sell it,
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.780]   you'll sell your current car for something
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:46.300]   and you'll go and get some money together
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:47.820]   and go buy another one.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.740]   So I would say, number one, just ignore the whole question.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:53.260]   Don't even bother to have a goal for a car.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.180]   Focus on accumulating assets.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.420]   So what I got excited about was when you described to me,
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.540]   you said, you know, we're gonna buy a home
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.580]   and then we're gonna buy a next home,
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.180]   we're gonna try to do this a few times.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:05.260]   And when I think of a newlywed couple
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.460]   who's just moving in and being together
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.200]   and still young and willing to be aggressive,
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.020]   and I think about the idea of you buying three or four houses
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.820]   in the next six or seven years,
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.540]   I'm much more excited about you having three or four houses
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.100]   in the next six or seven years
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.380]   than I am about anything else.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.060]   And you won't wanna do that six years from now, right?
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.420]   Six years from now, if you've got a couple of children,
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.180]   you won't want to be flexible and move.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.140]   It's too much of a hassle.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.360]   The children, this house works for us.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.460]   This house is close to the school that we want
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.260]   and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.580]   So you've got a very narrow window of time
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:42.820]   at which this aggressive kind of house hacking approach,
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.380]   you know, buy, move in, live there, move out,
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.740]   rent it in 12 months, buy a bunch of houses.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.620]   And we've got dual income that we can get good financing.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.140]   You've got a very small window of time.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.180]   And so from a financial perspective,
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.300]   the pressure should be all about accumulating
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.740]   as many houses as is appropriate for your family
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.840]   in this very narrow window of time
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.440]   before you guys become old, you know, married people
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.340]   who just don't wanna deal with the hassle of moving again.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.360]   And that'll happen faster than you think.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.680]   It'll happen probably within about six years.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.940]   And you just won't wanna deal with the hassle anymore.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.780]   But during the next few years,
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.740]   if all of your focus is on buying a property,
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.400]   two years later, buying another property,
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.180]   two years later, buying another property,
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.380]   you flip one or two,
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.180]   you've got an amazing foundation for yourself
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.260]   by taking those actions.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.500]   So I would just say, ignore saving for a car.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.020]   If your current cars will work forever, no problem at all.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.020]   If you need to replace them,
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.500]   then just pause and take some money.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.140]   You'll have money from savings and you'll just go buy a car.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   You don't need to be in that world of,
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.240]   I need to plan ahead for five years from now
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.280]   and what should I do?
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.240]   Just focus on accumulating investment assets.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.960]   That's option number one, all right?
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.520]   Option number two is this.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.540]   I think if you want to drive, you know, nicer cars
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.240]   and you wanna have motivation,
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.240]   the best goal to set is I'm going to buy an investment
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.820]   that is going to pay for my consumption.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.200]   So what I mean by that is you figure out
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.120]   what kind of car you want to have.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.400]   You describe a $25,000 car.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.640]   You figure out what, you know,
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.160]   go out and look at whatever brand new car you want.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.000]   Figure out what the lease payment on that car is.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.080]   Maybe it's $500 a month.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.080]   And then say, here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.120]   I'm gonna go, instead of saving for the car,
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.160]   I'm gonna save for an investment asset
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.000]   that's gonna buy me a car for the rest of my life.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.760]   And so if you go and you take the money
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.880]   that you would otherwise save for the car
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.560]   and instead you go and buy a house
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.800]   and the house has a net cashflow of $500 a month,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.520]   then now, five years from now,
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.640]   when you're ready for another car,
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.440]   just go out and lease a car
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.240]   and have your house pay your lease payment for you.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.840]   Or go out and buy a car
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.400]   and have your house pay your car payment for you.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.740]   And position your asset accumulation
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.820]   with a specific consumption target.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.960]   So I wish, I appreciate the dedication of people
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.440]   who are good savers like you're describing,
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.040]   who are sitting down and who are saying,
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.320]   all right, I think in five years, I'm gonna need a car.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.760]   And so if I do $200 a month
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.360]   at the current high yield savings rate, great.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.760]   You know, that's good.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.600]   If you just go a half a step further and say,
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.020]   how can I buy an asset that will pay for this consumption
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.760]   item for the rest of my life?
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.940]   I think it's way more motivating.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.260]   It's totally doable.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.280]   It certainly will cost you more money
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.800]   than just paying for the car, but it's totally doable.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.120]   And now for the rest of your life,
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.040]   you know that whenever I need a new car,
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.480]   I've got this house over here and one, two, three,
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.720]   Maple Street, this is our new car house.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.640]   And now honey, we gotta get you a new car house.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.360]   So let's go and buy 457 Fern Avenue
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   and 457 Fern Avenue, that's your new car house.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.400]   And put names on your investments.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.120]   And what's cool is do it from cashflow.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.460]   And then magically when you wake up 20 years from now
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.880]   and the mortgages are all paid off,
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.360]   now you have the giant asset plus the cashflow
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   and the cashflow continues to grow and you're good to go.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.240]   So to me, I don't wanna get too involved
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.280]   in all of the complications that you described.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.220]   I'm either gonna just ignore it and focus on accumulating
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:17.140]   because you can get cars anytime you need 'em
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:20.160]   and/or option B to say, let me buy an asset
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.180]   that will pay for this car five years from now
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.020]   when I need it.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.580]   - Gotcha.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.800]   Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.480]   I totally understand the point of view.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:32.960]   And I guess my fear is, you know,
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.920]   housing, the housing market has been going up so much
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.320]   and it feels at times that houses are going up faster
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.000]   than you can even say for a down payment.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.140]   And it's just gotten so difficult that I'm like,
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.600]   well, if I'm barely making it as is,
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.200]   well, you know, with the $2,000 in, you know,
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.760]   it's probably gonna tell me if I'm buying a house
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.740]   that is, let's say $300,000 down the line,
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:00.160]   I will need like, what, like 100, almost like 80, 60K
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.880]   just for a decent down payment plus the commissions
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.720]   and all that.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.820]   There's so much money that is required.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.720]   And I feel like we're not even saving fast enough
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.240]   because, you know, I wanna be really aggressive,
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.960]   really wanna, like you said, I wanna do it
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.440]   before it becomes more and more difficult.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.080]   So I guess that was my fear.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.180]   I didn't want, in the future, I didn't want like
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:25.800]   a car payment be something that will cap the speed
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.160]   or the rate at which I am saving money.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.360]   So that's why I was seeing it from the point of view
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.120]   of like, okay, well, if I save for now,
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.280]   then I won't have a car payment.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.840]   But I understand where you're coming from.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.280]   - Yeah, it's, can you save for, sure.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.160]   I just don't see, I don't see the point of expensive cars.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.080]   I don't, I really don't.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.760]   I think I acknowledge that they are necessary.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.280]   You know, when you study signaling theory,
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.240]   I acknowledge that for some people they're necessary.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.800]   I've just always found cars to be pretty disposable.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.960]   And like, I don't ever wanna get into the point
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.800]   where I have to save for a car.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.680]   And so to me, you know, that's part of it is my 10% number.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.520]   If you're buying cars that are 10% of your annual income,
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.320]   then, which I think you should be,
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.660]   then you can pretty much do that anytime you want.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:08.480]   And you just save for a couple of months
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.200]   and you can get yourself a new car.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.560]   And in the United States where the used car market
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.360]   is so powerful, and they're just so abundant,
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.560]   it's, again, you can walk out and you can get yourself
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.860]   a perfectly reasonable car any day of the week.
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.400]   I'm not opposed to you having, you know,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.980]   a more expensive car than what I described.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.700]   But I think you'll be better off
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.520]   with focusing on accumulating the assets.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.240]   You will figure out and fill in the specific details
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.080]   of the plan.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.840]   So first house, probably do FHA financing, right?
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.120]   It's a small down payment if you can make a deal work
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.480]   with an FHA loan.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.040]   So you'll put your small down payment,
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.600]   that frees up a little bit of money.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.960]   Then you'll save, save, save.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.040]   You may refinance.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.760]   If real estate prices are going up,
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:50.640]   then sometimes what you do is you refinance
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.240]   the first house that you're in,
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.680]   and then you use the freed up equity
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.000]   to help you with the down payment of the second house.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.560]   Along the way, you might sell.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.640]   Let's say you bought two houses with what you could save,
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640]   and then now you wanna buy the third house,
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.520]   but you don't have the money.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.920]   So this time, instead of renting the second house,
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.200]   you may have a good bit of equity,
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.520]   so you sell the second house.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.680]   But that gives you enough money to make two down payments
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.100]   on houses three and four, which then become two and three.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:14.940]   So you're smart.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.360]   You'll fill in those details along the way.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.600]   I'm purely talking conceptually.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.040]   And I'm not saying there's anything wrong
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.000]   with saving for a car.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.520]   I think, however, it's a constant middle-class mindset
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.800]   that gets people into that.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.000]   And so I've never seen,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.080]   when I said describe middle-class mindset,
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.300]   the biggest that most people's minds go
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.960]   in terms of goals they can set is I'm gonna buy a car,
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.760]   I'm gonna buy a house to live in,
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.920]   and okay, I'm gonna keep working this job,
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.040]   and I'm gonna save for another car.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.260]   And that's kind of a middle-class mindset.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.560]   I would say an upper-class or wealthy mindset
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.220]   is more like what I described.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.960]   I'm gonna focus on investing, investing,
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.280]   and I'm gonna just say it's the car,
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.560]   I'll buy a car whenever I need one.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.520]   I'm always gonna have 10 grand in the bank,
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.140]   so the idea that I can't go buy a car is silly.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.920]   And then on the flip side is
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:07.000]   I wanna have this consumption item,
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.740]   so let me wait on the consumption item
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.120]   and focus on buying assets that are gonna provide me
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.960]   with income for the consumption item.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.720]   'Cause I don't wanna drive a $10,000 car, Josh,
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.760]   I wanna drive a fancy car.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.960]   Cool, well, if you'll buy an asset
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.280]   that'll pay for you the fancy car, then you're good.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.460]   And so just delay that consumption a couple years
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.880]   until you can afford the asset,
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.000]   and then you'll be free for the rest of your life.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.840]   And in the beginning, it feels a little slower,
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.920]   'cause your college buddy who's 34
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.600]   comes home in a $75,000 pickup truck,
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.480]   and you're oohing and aahing over it,
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.960]   but he will never achieve escape velocity.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.440]   But if you'll wait an extra three years beyond it,
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.740]   then you can drive whatever fancy cars you want
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.760]   for the rest of your life if you'll buy the assets first.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.200]   So that should be the focus is purchasing those assets
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.480]   and not purchasing the consumption items.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.680]   All right, we go to the great state of Texas.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.640]   Welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:58.280]   - Hi, Josh, thanks, great show.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.200]   I have a quick question.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.640]   A couple of months ago, you mentioned a former colleague
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.360]   who had started with you
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.460]   when you were doing financial planning.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.160]   You were kind of dismissive of him.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:11.360]   He was the son of a, he was a rich kid,
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.560]   and he didn't have much academic or technical knowledge.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.740]   It sounds like he ended up being very successful,
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.500]   and in hindsight, what lessons would you take away from that?
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:24.800]   You never really went down that rabbit hole.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.360]   What perspectives or mindsets did he hold
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.400]   that allowed him to be as successful as he was,
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.280]   and was part of that a matter of time?
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.920]   Would you have achieved the same level that he had
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.360]   had you stayed in that previous endeavor?
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.920]   - Fair questions, and good questions.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.840]   So I've thought a lot about this
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:48.720]   because I learned so much from the situation.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.720]   And let's begin with what I realized I was wrong about.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.480]   The first thing that was important to note
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.480]   was just because somebody has not had a bunch of jobs
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.840]   doesn't mean that he doesn't know how to work.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:09.000]   One of the things that was my experience in life
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.240]   was I always worked.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.080]   I've always worked.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.000]   I've always had jobs.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.400]   I had summer jobs from an early age.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.880]   I remember making money,
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.000]   so I've had all these different jobs.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.400]   He never had jobs.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.440]   His first job was his job out of college.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.480]   But that didn't mean that he didn't know how to work.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.680]   Now, I don't know all that much about his grades.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.360]   I don't know all that much about what he did
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.460]   in college and in high school.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.720]   So I just know some things.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:42.260]   But what I observed was that a man can learn to work
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.700]   at things that are not a paying job.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:50.840]   The skill of being productive,
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.780]   productivity is not only measured in having a job.
[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:59.600]   So he was probably working all the way along with his grades
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.400]   and then he was on sports teams.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.160]   And he had all kinds of things that he did.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.040]   They just weren't jobs.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.880]   And so one of the things that I have changed
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.000]   about my perspective,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.800]   and I see this more clearly now as a father
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.800]   than I did back then.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.160]   I see this now when, you know,
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:16.700]   if my children come to me and say,
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.900]   dad, you know, we want a job.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.180]   I look at it and I say, okay, you can go get a job.
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.700]   That's fine.
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:27.700]   But I know that the benefits from that job
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.740]   are gonna be nothing like the benefits
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:34.260]   that can be gained from doing more academics.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.500]   And I look at the amount of money
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.580]   that my children would earn at their job,
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.620]   especially at this very young age,
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.860]   and I think, I can just give you this money every day.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:43.060]   I don't need your, I don't,
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.280]   the amount of money that you're earning at the job
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.840]   is irrelevant to our family.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.000]   I can just pull out my wallet and give you the money.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.080]   But if you'll stay focused on your academics,
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.240]   if you'll stay focused on your pedigree,
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.820]   if you'll stay focused on the knowledge that you accumulate
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:01.720]   and the skills that you accumulate,
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.680]   you'll start at a much higher level.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.280]   And so while I wasn't, we weren't poor,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.120]   what I realized is this is the difference,
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.520]   when I was growing up, I was never poor,
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.800]   but I realized this is the difference
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.060]   between a working class mentality
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:16.740]   that prioritizes having a job
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.480]   versus an upper class mentality
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.980]   that prioritizes starting at the right level.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.860]   And the best example of this
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:28.220]   is somebody who is, goes for a career
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:33.220]   that is very high investment, but yet very high payoff.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.580]   And so I think of a friend of mine
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.600]   who was a very specialized surgeon.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:44.320]   He went to school for I don't know how many years
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.360]   to become this very specialized surgeon.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.580]   And he, of course, high school, college, medical school,
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.640]   residency, and all the specialties,
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.020]   just crazy long amounts in school.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:59.400]   He had seven figures of student loan debt when he finished.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.800]   But then by the time he was,
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.880]   before he was 40, he had sold his practice.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.240]   He was earning seven figures a year.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.280]   He had sold his practice for eight figures.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.320]   And by the time he was 40,
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.500]   it was in a radically different perspective.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.660]   And so I never in my life even conceded,
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.940]   or sorry, conceived of going and being a lawyer
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.900]   because I just didn't understand,
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:21.380]   I wasn't gonna go,
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.900]   why would anybody go and borrow hundreds of thousands
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.740]   of dollars?
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:28.900]   I didn't understand that there is a very legitimate payoff
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:31.500]   to these kinds of investments in life.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.140]   And so what I observed is that his work ethic
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:37.380]   was not expressed exclusively based,
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:40.380]   his work ethic was not inferior to mine,
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.780]   just because he had not previously had a bunch of jobs
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.940]   like I had.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.340]   On the contrary, he had great work ethic,
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:51.800]   and that work ethic was certainly honed by other activities.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.300]   The second thing that I observed is he had a set of skills
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.460]   and relationships that I never had in that business.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:03.140]   The skills were enormously social skills
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:05.500]   and networking skills.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.820]   And then that was compounded by the relationships.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.660]   So when I started as a financial advisor,
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.180]   I didn't know any rich people.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.860]   I was so intimidated by talking to rich people.
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:17.780]   And so all I knew was that I liked personal finance
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.780]   and I wanted to be rich.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.820]   And so I had spent a lot of time
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:21.220]   reading personal finance books.
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.560]   And I leaned on academics, I leaned on knowledge.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.020]   And the financial advisor business
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.100]   is not a knowledge business,
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.100]   it's a relationships business.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:35.080]   I never had the skills of relationship formation
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.100]   that he did.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.620]   And I never had the comfort of interacting
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.420]   with wealthy people that he did.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:44.060]   So I remember like the biggest premium
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.520]   in the life insurance business that I ever showed
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.860]   was $150,000 a year.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.060]   And I was working with this guy
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:54.060]   who was a super rich attorney, made lots of money.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.420]   And I was like, okay, I'm gonna show this guy
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:59.420]   $150,000 a year premium on a whole life policy.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.740]   And I did the presentation
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.140]   and I was quaking in my boots the entire time.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:05.640]   I could never believe that somebody could spend
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.680]   $150,000 a year on whole life insurance.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.600]   And I knew that it made sense.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.680]   I wasn't showing it because it didn't make sense.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.960]   I figured, okay, probably up to 100
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.640]   would probably be smart, but I was pushing it
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.400]   'cause the numbers are all,
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.800]   everything looks a little bit higher.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.240]   So I showed $150,000 a premium.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.320]   And I couldn't even conceive
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.080]   of how somebody could have that much money
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.700]   to where they would spend $150,000 a year on life insurance.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.780]   Now, that guy, he didn't buy 150.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.340]   I think it was a little bit more than 50.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.740]   But that was, I was even 50,000 a year.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:46.500]   It was like, I was so uncomfortable in that situation.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.740]   But my friend had grown up in a world
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:51.420]   in which there was so much money around
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.500]   that of course you just show,
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.540]   why would you ever show a life insurance illustration
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:56.900]   for less than six figures?
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:00.940]   And it was a world that I couldn't even conceive of.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.940]   And so a lot of this stuff has to do
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.420]   with what you believe about yourself
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.940]   and what you believe about the world.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.460]   And he was comfortable being from a high-income world.
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.700]   And he was totally comfortable with the big money,
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:12.580]   with the big dollars.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.180]   Whereas I was going out and showing life insurance policies
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.220]   to my college friends at $100 a month.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:18.140]   And there's a big difference
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:20.540]   in your overall production and performance.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.260]   The other thing is he had the context
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:23.860]   and I never had the context.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.780]   I was building context based on technical skill
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.060]   and technical knowledge.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.900]   He had context based upon family circles
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:34.620]   and him being a good guy and known in the community.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.780]   And in that kind of business,
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.820]   it's very much a relationship business.
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:40.020]   And so he was a decade in front of me
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.820]   in terms of his connections in the business
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.280]   versus where I was.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.700]   Other things I observed is that I never knew
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.300]   how the process of building those contacts would work.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.580]   Whereas he was comfortable
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:56.060]   with the process of building those things.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.020]   You know, I didn't grow up going to conferences
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.620]   or networking events with my parents.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.820]   My first networking events,
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:05.820]   I was so scared standing in a room full of people,
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.100]   I didn't know what to do.
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.780]   And so I studied and I went and I found a book.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.020]   And what set me free was I found a book that gave me,
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.420]   it was a Bob Berg book on selling and networking.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.220]   And he gave me 10 questions
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.300]   that were good conversation starters.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.060]   And I memorized those 10 questions
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.300]   and I would go to networking events
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.780]   and I would just say those questions
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.720]   and they worked every single time.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.260]   I knew what to do 'cause now I had a pathway to go on.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.760]   Whereas what I observed about him is that for him,
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.820]   the social dynamics were always much more comfortable.
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.700]   And he was super good looking,
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.780]   super, you know, just amazing social skills.
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:43.500]   He was smart, he was confident, he was funny.
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.240]   I never observed him to be cruel or unkind to anybody.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.140]   He was just the life of the party, a really great guy.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:51.140]   And then he also had everything,
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:53.420]   he was comfortable in his skin
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.700]   with all of the external trappings of success.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:59.460]   So, you know, he came into work on the first day
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:02.460]   and he's wearing a, driving a fancy BMW
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.940]   and wearing a flashy suit with all the flashy stuff.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.860]   I was a super practical guy, you know,
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:10.140]   I was driving a Honda Accord around,
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.380]   a $3,000 Honda Accord when I started
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.360]   and I would always tone down the flash.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.740]   Like the idea for me of wearing, you know,
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.940]   all the fancy stuff and the super expensive watch,
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.180]   like that's not me, that's not who I am.
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.660]   And I never thought that I could become who I was,
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:25.740]   whereas he was comfortable with that.
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.660]   So he fit well in the social class.
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:30.060]   And then finally, he was inspiring to people.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:35.060]   So his big wins came from being in management,
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:42.380]   so being a recruiter and being good at recruiting people.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:46.460]   And so he had the image of a successful recruiter,
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.600]   which was something that I never had.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:53.020]   And my biggest mistake was that I always,
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:56.340]   I briefly ran a college recruitment program
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.260]   for our college internship program.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.540]   And my biggest mistake is that I just believe in everybody.
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:04.180]   And I believe that anybody can make anything of themselves.
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:06.060]   And, you know, my managing director was like,
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.100]   "Joshua, not everybody can do it.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.700]   "You've got to cut people loose."
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.820]   And the idea of cutting people loose for me
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.180]   is just not something that I like to do.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.940]   I believe in everybody.
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:18.140]   So those were some of the lessons that I learned.
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:21.940]   And I realized that you have to be careful of,
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.740]   you need to appreciate the path that you've gone on,
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:30.620]   but not think that just because the path is familiar to you,
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:33.300]   that it's actually the best path.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:36.680]   And I appreciate, I have nothing bad to say
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:37.660]   about my childhood.
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:39.860]   I'm grateful for everything about it.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:43.940]   But my childhood was never oriented around the best path
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:47.580]   for wealth building and, you know, making a lot of money.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:51.580]   And that's fine.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:53.260]   But when we talk about it,
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:54.620]   we have to look at what other people do
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.420]   and then figure out what makes those other people different.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.860]   And that's what I've tried to analyze.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.860]   Now, your second question,
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:02.260]   could I have been as successful as he was?
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.180]   I think probably not.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:05.500]   And there are a few reasons for that.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:10.140]   Number one was I found that business largely boring.
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:12.540]   And I didn't enjoy,
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:16.060]   I didn't enjoy the,
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.860]   I found it kind of boring.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:23.020]   And that was ultimately one of the biggest reasons I moved.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.140]   Because when you said the same thing a hundred times,
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:26.260]   why do you want to say it again?
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:27.580]   Just so I can make money.
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:30.980]   I've never valued money enough just to do something boring.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:33.140]   I care a lot about like vision and impact.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.660]   And so that really hurt me,
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:38.100]   is that business is a doing man's business.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:39.900]   It's not a thinking man's business.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.540]   I was always drawn to the next thing.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.260]   And so, okay, I've mastered this area of planning.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.820]   Let me go to something else.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.060]   And then the problem is
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.580]   you've got to bring these things together.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.940]   And so you can be a really great technical planner,
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.900]   but you've got to be in the space
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.100]   in which that is necessary.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:58.860]   So the people who are the best technical planners,
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.300]   I think probably should be working in the office
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.740]   side by side with somebody
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:05.060]   who is the best connector and networker
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.940]   and the most fluent in connecting with people.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.020]   And so you really want to build big partnerships.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.500]   But what I didn't do was I was always doing it alone.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.500]   And so I've got to go out
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.300]   and I've got to make the connections.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:19.780]   And I've got to make the connections
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:24.220]   and also do the planning.
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:27.300]   And so those two things are often opposed
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.620]   and they're kind of a different skill set.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.780]   And then this is going to sound like
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.300]   I'm trying to be self-righteous, but it's not.
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:35.700]   I never cared.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:38.500]   Like I always cared for the people who were broke.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.140]   That was who I wanted to help
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.780]   because I always figured the rich people are doing fine.
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.300]   And since I was never super motivated by money,
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:49.700]   it was not, trying to make as much money as possible
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.020]   was never a value that was held in my family growing up.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.100]   It was not something that I embraced.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.100]   And so I was always trying to help catastrophe cases
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:04.820]   and pull them back from the tracks a little bit.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.660]   And so that doesn't work very well
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:10.940]   with regard to building a financial planning business.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:13.540]   'Cause the most effective financial planning business,
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.380]   generally the most profitable, the most successful,
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:19.900]   generally involves an element of ruthlessness.
[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:23.260]   You have to continually and ruthlessly pair
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:28.260]   your low potential clients off of your work
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:31.020]   so that you can go out and find higher potential clients.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:33.180]   And it's a pretty ruthless business
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:36.860]   and I wasn't temperamentally really well suited for it.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.740]   So no, I don't think I ever would have been
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.100]   as effective as him.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:44.460]   I don't think I inspired the kind of respect that he did.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.500]   So because he had the whole package,
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.260]   not Wolf on Wall Street, again,
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:50.780]   I have nothing but good things to say about this man.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.900]   I always thought he was good hearted and everything.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:56.100]   But there's an element of ruthlessness
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:56.940]   that you've got to have.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.060]   And in fact, I know other friends of mine
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:01.380]   who kind of fit my temperament.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.140]   Those of us who go through the world
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.180]   thinking that it's our job to just help everybody,
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:08.020]   we don't do well in that business
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.180]   because you spend so much time on the people
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:12.540]   who you're never gonna be able to help,
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:14.660]   but I believe in you and I really wanna help you.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:16.180]   And you've gotta cut people loose.
[01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:19.900]   And so he is a good guy,
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.140]   but he has that element of ruthlessness that's necessary.
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.380]   And I don't think I ever could have developed that
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:27.180]   nor would I have wanted to develop it.
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.420]   I could have had a very satisfying career,
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.460]   done perfectly fine.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:31.860]   There's lots of people in that business
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.780]   who are not ruthless.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:34.780]   But to be at the top,
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:36.740]   you've got to have that element of ruthlessness.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.540]   And I don't think that's something that,
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:40.100]   it's certainly not something I have
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.420]   and I don't think it's something that I wanna have.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.380]   - Great answer.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:47.580]   I'll call in next week with some follow-ups.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.740]   Thank you.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.140]   - My pleasure, please do.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:52.380]   All right, and Jeremy in Montana,
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:53.740]   thank you for your patience, Jeremy.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:54.580]   Round us out today.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.660]   How can I serve you today?
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.140]   - Yeah, good afternoon, Joshua.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.540]   I'm hoping that I do not drop you
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.820]   if you're driving right now,
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:05.580]   but wanted to get your thoughts
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:10.580]   on potentially taking a voluntary severance from my work.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:15.900]   I know that financially I'd be fine.
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:21.220]   Severance would be about a year and a half of expenses.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.380]   And then my wife also works
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:27.980]   and she makes before tax just under our yearly expenses.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:30.060]   We're around half five,
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:35.060]   granted about 75% of that is in retirement funds.
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:38.900]   But I just haven't loved my job for a while
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:43.140]   and kind of thinking of this as an opportunity
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.420]   to make a career change
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:48.780]   and take a little bit of a break for a couple months
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:52.740]   and then find something that would be more up my alley.
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:55.580]   - Do you have any idea of what you might wanna go to?
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:57.060]   Like, is there anything out there
[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.660]   that you've been thinking about?
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.180]   - There's a few things,
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:04.620]   but I have a challenge with that
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:08.140]   because I feel like I've done a few different jobs
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:11.220]   and I can find aspects of any job that I like,
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.460]   but maybe not necessarily love.
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.820]   So I don't have something that right now
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:19.980]   I feel like I'm really being pulled towards.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:23.140]   - If you take this voluntary severance,
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.540]   and just to repeat, you said it,
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.060]   the severance offer is one and a half years
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:29.260]   of your household expenses, is that correct?
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.260]   - Yeah, about that.
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.300]   - All right, and if you were to take
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.660]   this voluntary severance,
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.700]   and don't worry about the baby, it's fine.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.780]   We're a family-friendly show.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:38.980]   If you were to take the one and a half,
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.020]   if you were to take the severance,
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.660]   could you get back into this industry
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:48.540]   at a similar job, at a similar company fairly easily,
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:49.580]   or would this be the kind of thing
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.420]   that's really hard to get back into?
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:56.700]   - Yeah, so as part of the severance,
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.860]   you can't ever go back to the company
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.660]   and work for them correctly.
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:05.660]   I think that there's like manufacturers
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.900]   and contractors that work in this industry
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.660]   that I probably could find something.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.340]   The one thing that is a set of challenges,
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:15.900]   you know, we live in a rural area,
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.860]   and right now I work from home.
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.380]   I don't have to travel.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.100]   As you can tell, I have a baby.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.740]   Like, I'm not really super interested in travel,
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:28.740]   which that might be a requirement for a lot of those jobs.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.700]   But I think that realistically,
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.540]   I probably could find something within the industry.
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.420]   - Why are they offering the voluntary severance package?
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:44.340]   - I mean, there's the reason,
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:47.260]   and then there's the reasons they say, probably.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:51.140]   I think that a lot of it is just the economic times
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.860]   that right now are challenging,
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:57.180]   and then the, quote, target audience for this
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:59.260]   is people that have been with the company
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.900]   for multiple decades and are highly compensated.
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:07.180]   But yeah, I think in part it's to get people
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.700]   off the books for expenses,
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:13.860]   potentially open up career opportunities
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.900]   for the young up-and-comers.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:19.180]   But it's hard to know for sure.
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.020]   - Right.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:26.300]   If you weren't, if you didn't have the voluntary severance,
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.020]   knowing that you don't really love the job,
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:29.860]   it doesn't seem like it's a good fit for you,
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.460]   what would be your timeline otherwise for leaving?
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:38.380]   - My timeline for leaving,
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.700]   I think if we got to buy, or just in general,
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.620]   if I could get off the job. - Just in general, let's say,
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.620]   'cause obviously, the reason you're considering it
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:47.140]   is you don't love the job.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.500]   So before you found out
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.660]   about this voluntary severance offer,
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:53.460]   when you were thinking about it
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:55.420]   or talking with your wife about how long
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:56.800]   you would keep working at this company
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.500]   versus do something else, what was your previous plan?
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.180]   - Yeah, so I had actually called in,
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.820]   like, I don't know, last year,
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.100]   earlier this year or last year,
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:09.020]   but I've been looking for new internal jobs.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:12.060]   I haven't actually looked externally.
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.820]   Like I said, I work from home,
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.980]   and the area I'm in, I'm pretty highly compensated.
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.900]   I just haven't been able to find anything internally
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.660]   that I've been able to land.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:25.740]   So that's the challenge, is I haven't actually.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:29.220]   (computer chimes)
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.340]   - Okay, last question.
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:32.580]   You may or may not be able to hear me
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:33.420]   'cause you may be breaking up,
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.140]   but last question is, if you,
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:39.460]   this thing that you can't ever come back to the company,
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.260]   is that some kind of contract,
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.060]   or is that just an unspoken assumption?
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:54.060]   All right, so, oop, now you're back.
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.300]   Did you hear my question?
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:59.060]   (computer chimes)
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.660]   So Jeremy's driving through Montana.
[01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:01.500]   No problem, Jeremy.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:02.900]   What we'll do is I'll just go ahead
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:04.660]   and answer your question broadly,
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.820]   and then you can listen to it afterward.
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.740]   We lost you off the call.
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:09.820]   So the question is,
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.580]   all right, I've got a voluntary severance offer,
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:14.260]   and it's kinda nice because they'll give me
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.300]   a year and a half of my expenses as a buyout option
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.500]   in order for me to give up the job.
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.040]   I'm halfway to financial independence.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.180]   My wife generates income that almost covers our expenses.
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:27.660]   So we're in a pretty good spot financially.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:29.620]   We can keep this going.
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.740]   Problem is, the job is highly paid.
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.020]   You're working from home.
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.460]   It's a good situation.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:36.980]   So things are pretty good.
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.140]   Obviously, because of the hard work you've done
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.620]   with your financial position,
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.060]   you could go either way.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:43.640]   Either way would be fine.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.020]   If you take it, everything's gonna be fine.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:47.300]   It's gonna work out.
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:49.940]   And if you don't take it, it's gonna be fine
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.140]   because, all right, I've been looking
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.380]   for other jobs internally,
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:55.900]   but I haven't been looking for other jobs externally.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:53:00.180]   So clearly, it's not that bad of an option.
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.980]   So you're gonna be fine either way
[01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:05.380]   because of the hard work you've done with your planning,
[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:07.840]   and you can just go with either option.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:08.680]   What I would say is,
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.340]   it's just useful to look at it strategically
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.700]   and to try to assess, what do I need most
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.720]   at this point in my life?
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:18.840]   So if the year and a half of expenses
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.740]   is gonna be useful to you
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:24.240]   because it could be a big move on to the next stage,
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.420]   then you're probably better off taking it.
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.540]   So what would be some strategic ways to use it?
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:29.760]   Okay, I need some time off.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:31.260]   Great, you can take two weeks off.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.260]   All right, take a month off, fine.
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:34.860]   But we're not taking 18 months off.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.860]   That's silly at this stage of life,
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.120]   unless there's some clear conviction
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.380]   that we wanna take 18 months
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.580]   and travel around the United States,
[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:43.380]   and that's always what we wanted to do, fine.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.820]   But the point is, if you can use this strategically,
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.660]   then it can be a real blessing.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.380]   So strategically, what we're looking for
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:53.260]   is not just taking time off and doing nothing.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.220]   We're looking for doing things
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.740]   that previously the work has made really hard to do.
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:01.380]   So getting a degree, another degree,
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:04.300]   making connections, looking for,
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.620]   starting something of my own,
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:08.220]   writing the book that I've always wanted to write,
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.620]   buying the business that I've always wanted to buy.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.340]   So if you can use the time that you have
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.820]   of a year of wiggle room
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:19.420]   as a way to move strategically to the next thing,
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:22.580]   then it can be the obvious solution.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:26.100]   If you don't have any idea on how to use it strategically,
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:28.860]   then it's not so valuable.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:32.100]   And it might be nicer to have this pretty cushy job
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:34.740]   where I work from home and I have a good schedule
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.620]   and I make a lot of money,
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.660]   I'm highly compensated for the area.
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:42.740]   That may turn out to be more useful in the long run.
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:47.740]   So I wouldn't take it until I can create a plan
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:50.620]   of how I'm going to invest the time
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:53.180]   and feel really good about the option.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.540]   Because if there are limited jobs in your area
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:01.540]   where you, for this kind of pay and these kinds of benefits,
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.140]   then just walking away from the one
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:08.300]   that is their first offer may not be the smartest idea.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:09.820]   So what I would challenge you to do
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:14.700]   is lay out a plan to say, number one, let's say I take it.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:18.300]   How can I really use this strategically
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:20.740]   in order to advance me on to the next phase
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.900]   of what I wanna do
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:24.140]   by giving me a little bit more time than I expected?
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:26.420]   And if you get a really good plan where it makes sense,
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:28.660]   then sure, go ahead and take the severance.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:31.700]   If you don't have that, then keep the job
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.780]   because they'll probably make you a similar offer
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.820]   in the future.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:40.500]   And if it's involuntary severance in the future,
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.140]   then they're probably gonna pay you out
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:43.700]   something like what you're doing now.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.780]   And if you can just keep this job
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.080]   and do everything else that you're doing,
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:49.940]   then why would you do that?
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:51.940]   The concern that I have is just simply,
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:53.500]   I don't want you to get rusty.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.540]   And if you take a year and a half off
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.860]   and you hang out and you play with your babies
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:59.140]   and you don't ever do anything
[01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:00.740]   and then the money starts to run out
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.580]   and your wife is saying,
[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:03.500]   "Hey, honey, can we get some money coming in here
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:04.500]   from your end?"
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.540]   Then it can be much more difficult
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:08.780]   to make progress from that.
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:10.620]   So Jeremy, those were my answers.
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:11.700]   You can go back and listen to it.
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.180]   But in essence, either one is fine
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.180]   because of the good financial position you're in.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:17.100]   I just think that before you take the severance,
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:19.580]   you should develop a really compelling plan
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:21.740]   that is so obviously useful to you
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:22.900]   and moving you and your wife
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:24.620]   towards what you really wanna go
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.860]   and then take the severance.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:28.420]   But if you don't have that, wait until you do have that.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.260]   Make sense?
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.460]   - That makes sense and I'll listen back
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.060]   'cause we were in and out.
[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:37.140]   I appreciate the input.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:37.980]   Thank you.
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.820]   - My pleasure.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.420]   And we move again to Seattle.
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.300]   Welcome to the show.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.620]   How can I serve you today?
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:49.380]   Seattle, Seattle, going once.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:55.580]   Seattle, Washington, going twice.
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:59.300]   Seattle, Seattle, you're up.
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.660]   You're up.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.860]   You've waited on so long.
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:02.700]   I don't have a name.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.540]   I don't have a number.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:04.380]   I just have so long.
[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:06.940]   So we will wrap it up with that.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:11.060]   All right.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.380]   That concludes our Friday Q&A show.
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.460]   Just wanted to give him just a moment to see.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.660]   Thank you so much for all the great calls today,
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.100]   all the great discussion.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:18.940]   Thank you for listening.
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:21.340]   I hope that you have found something useful here.
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:24.700]   As always, take what's useful and discard what is not.
