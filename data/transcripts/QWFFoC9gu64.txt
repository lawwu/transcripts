[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention very briefly this morning are to
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.640]   be found in that portion which we read from the second epistle of Peter, the first chapter
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.200]   in the sixteenth verse. "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.240]   made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.000]   of his majesty." The apostle Peter here was writing as an old man. He realized that
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.960]   his time on earth was drawing to an end and he was very concerned about these Christians,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.680]   these early churches, these young, immature Christian communities should be certain after
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.080]   his departure of the things on which alone their faith could rest and stand the buffeting
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.120]   and the trials and the troubles and the persecution that were certain to come to them. And here
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.720]   he reminds them of these things. He puts it like this. He says, "Wherefore, I will
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.120]   not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.160]   be established in the present truth. Yea, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.480]   to stir you up by putting you in remembrance, knowing that shortly I must put off this my
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.680]   tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me. Moreover, I will endeavor
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:49.560]   that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. For we
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.880]   have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.400]   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty and so on."
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.960]   Well now here the apostle, I think, helps us as we meet together on this Christmas morning
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.120]   to realize the meaning and the purpose of what we are doing. We need to be reminded
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.160]   of this. The apostle, you see, reminds these men, he says, "I know that you know these
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.400]   facts, but though I know that you know them, I am going on," he says, "to remind you
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   of them." Why? Well, because he knew very well that we are confronted by a very subtle
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.760]   adversary who is ever ready to make us misinterpret what we know, to put a new edge onto it, to
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.800]   attach a new meaning to it, and eventually to reach a point in which we have evacuated
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.480]   the truth of its real meaning and have turned it into something else.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.920]   Now at a time like this, at every Christmas season, I feel more and more that we, in our
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.520]   time and in our turn, need this particular exhortation of the apostle Peter, because
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.400]   the world is so busy in trying to turn this Christmas message into something that it rarely
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.040]   isn't. The newspapers are doing it, the shops are doing it, industries are doing it,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.440]   the whole world seems to have entered into a great conspiracy to turn this glorious message
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.160]   of the New Testament into something that is entirely different and rarely bears very little
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.520]   relationship, if any at all, to that which is actually the truth. And in particular it
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:47.280]   is doing so at the present time in this way. It is putting all its emphasis upon ideas
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.560]   and withdrawing attention from the facts. Now there are fashions in religion, fashions
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.640]   in theology, as in everything else, and that is the latest fashion. The latest fashion
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.560]   in religious circles is to say that really the facts don't matter very much. It doesn't
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.400]   matter very much, we are told, whether the facts are true or not. They call them myths.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.320]   And a myth is something which isn't actually a fact, but more or less represents a fact
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.640]   and seems to carry the meaning of a fact. And that is the latest vogue. We are told
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.720]   that if our Christian faith and gospel are to appeal to the modern intelligent men, well
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   then we must demythologize it. The modern man, we are told, can't believe in miracles,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.400]   of course, because he's scientifically minded. And as long as we attach all these miracles
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.600]   and marvels and wonders to our presentation of truth, we are just antagonizing these men
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.040]   of understanding. So we are told we must get rid of all that. Well how do we do so? Well,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.800]   we are told the way is this. All we need to hold onto are the religious ideas. The facts
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.200]   are immaterial. It doesn't matter, we are told, whether Christ was born of a virgin
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.740]   or not. Indeed, some would go so far as to say it doesn't matter whether Christ ever
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.240]   lived or not, as long as his teaching remains, as long as the idea remains. It doesn't
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.480]   matter whether he literally arose from the grave in the body on the morning of the third
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.400]   day. It doesn't matter. It's this principle of resurrection. It's this idea of renewal
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.160]   that matters. And so, you see, there is this grave danger at the present time that the
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   facts themselves are dismissed, are regarded as myths, as fables, as stories, which simply
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:45.040]   represent in a dramatic form these great principles and truths and ideas which we are told are
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.960]   of such value to the human race. Now that, you see, as the apostle reminds us here, is
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.800]   ultimately nothing but a denial of the Christian faith. We have not followed cunningly devised
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:08.720]   fables. These things are not fairy tales. These are not stories. Our Christian faith
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:17.520]   is based upon facts, solid concrete facts. And indeed, if that isn't the case, we simply
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.840]   evacuate the gospel, as I say, of its central glory, and of the thing that makes it most
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.680]   wonderful of all. Now, if there are special occasions when we
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.120]   should remind ourselves of this, it is on these days in the church's calendar when
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.880]   we remind ourselves of the cardinal facts concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. And here
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   is the first, his birth, the fact of his birth in that little town of Bethlehem in a stable,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:00.340]   and how they put him there in a manger as his crib. Now the whole glory of the gospel
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.280]   lies in facts such as these, and every other fact in connection with his life, the facts
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.560]   that are recorded in the four gospels. And there is no doubt at all that that is why
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.440]   the church was led by the Holy Spirit to write the four gospels and to record them. There
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   were so many fables being circulated about our Lord, and there were others who were denying
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.400]   the facts altogether and saying that he really did not take unto him human nature, but that
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.900]   he had just a phantom body, that the incarnation really didn't take place. All those heresies
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:42.600]   and false notions were already current in the first century. And the Holy Spirit led
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.260]   the leaders of the early church to write these records and to guard them and to safeguard
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:54.920]   them and to reject apocryphal gospels because these facts are not only facts, but are really
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   essential to a true Christian belief, to a virile Christian faith. We are concerned,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:11.780]   I say, not about cunningly devised fables, but very definitely and very specifically
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:20.200]   about facts. And what are these facts? Well, it is as we come to look at them that we shall
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.160]   see why it is so important to insist upon the facts and to reject this whole notion
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:34.400]   of fables. Because it is in the facts that the love of God is rarely displayed to us.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.600]   It would, I admit, be a wonderful thing if God were to give some great phenomenon in
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.160]   the heavens in order to attract our attention. That would be a great act of condescension
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:53.080]   on God's behalf. If God had sent his Son into the world as some kind of apparition,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.360]   it would have been a wonderful thing. If the Son of God had come into this world in a phantom
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.600]   body, it would have been amazing. There are these theophanies that are recorded in the
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.560]   Old Testament, and every one of them is a very remarkable thing. And they are worthy
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.800]   of our careful consideration. These appearances of the Son of God in the form of an angel
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   – you get it in the case of Abram, you get it happening to the father and mother of Samson
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:29.440]   and others – these theophanies, these appearances of God, they are very wonderful. But if I
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:38.040]   may use such language, they pale into insignificance when you put them side by side with this thing
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:45.080]   that happened in the little town of Bethlehem. For what happened there, as the Gospels are
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.680]   so careful to remind us, and as Peter was reminding these people at this point, what
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.800]   happened there was this. That the eternal Son of God, substance of the very eternal
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:08.480]   substance, literally and actually, entered into the Virgin's womb. And there, literally,
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:16.440]   physically, materially, took unto himself human nature. Now, it's a great mystery,
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.640]   it's a great marvel. Of course, we don't understand it. How can we understand something
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.840]   like this? We are never meant to understand it. We are meant to believe it. But that is
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.520]   the fact, that is what we are told. That though he still, as the second person in the blessed
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:42.720]   Holy Trinity, is still in heaven, he is at the same time, literally, in that Virgin's
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:55.480]   womb. And he went there, and he came into this world for us, and for our salvation.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:03.600]   This isn't a fable. This mustn't be put into the category of the fantasies. No, no,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:11.600]   this is literal fact, this is history. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, a literal child, a
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:20.560]   physical human being, as human as you and I are. And it's there, I say, we really begin
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.680]   to understand the love of God. It isn't merely that he manifests it, it is in what
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:34.280]   he does, in what he's done, that we rarely see the love of God. Think of this condescension,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   think of this self-abasement, this self-humiliation. We can't conceive of it. That he, who was
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.360]   with God from the beginning in the bosom of the Father from all eternity, sharing in and
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:57.600]   basking in the everlasting and eternal glory, should have laid it all aside, as Charles
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.280]   Wesley has just reminded us in that greatest of all Christmas hymns, "Mild he laid his
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:11.000]   glory by." He didn't cease to be God. He didn't divest himself of any portion or
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.800]   particle of his deity and his divinity. No, no, he laid aside the insignia, the signs,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:26.560]   the external appearances of his glory, and took taking unto himself his human nature.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:34.080]   He was there born as a babe, so that ordinary people with an uninstructed and an unenlightened
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.840]   eye looking at him saw nothing but a babe. But those who had been prepared as the shepherds
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.760]   were and others by the message from heaven itself, went and saw and beheld and returned
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.000]   glorying and wondering at the things which they had seen. It's there, I say, we see
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:04.480]   it. This is the love of God, that God has come amongst us in the flesh, that the Word
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:14.420]   was made flesh. Not that it appeared, but was made flesh, literally, actually, and so
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:22.040]   on with all the other effects that are recorded concerning him. It is here, I say, and here
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.720]   alone, that we really begin to understand the love of God. We see the love of God in
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.400]   every idea that is taught in the Scripture. If God merely tells us that he loves us, it's
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   a wonderful thing, but it's an infinitely bigger and greater thing for God to tell us
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:49.760]   in this form, in his Son actually coming in the flesh and living in a world like this,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:58.040]   with its shame and its sorrow, with all its evil and its sin. He came and he endured the
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.640]   contradiction of sinners against himself for thirty-three years. He shared in the life
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.240]   of ordinary men and women like ourselves. He knew something about the buffetings of
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.480]   life. He knew hunger and thirst. He knew grief and sorrow. He was aware of disappointment
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.720]   in his followers and in his friends. Ah, he knows it all, tempted, in all points like
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.180]   as we are, yet without sin. My brethren, how vital it is that we should realize that these
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.400]   things are facts and that they're not merely myths or fables. You're evacuating them
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.440]   of their central glory if you do that. These are not ideas. This has happened. It's
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:53.480]   taken place. And so it behoves us constantly to come back and to remember the facts. The
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.960]   Christian message is not merely an idea about love. It isn't a mere teaching about brotherhood
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.760]   and friendship and fellowship. It is that, but it's infinitely more than that. It's
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   this action of God, taken once in time, the unique event, the turning point of all history,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:21.760]   when God sent forth his son into the world on a particular date and time and place. Hold
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.980]   on to the facts, I say, and let us beware of this specious philosophy that presenting
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:36.400]   itself in the form of a Christian message is a final denial of the real glory of it
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   all.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:44.000]   We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.920]   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. As his friend
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.720]   and fellow apostle John put it, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:06.160]   of the Father, full of grace and truth." Very well. Christmas Day is a very convenient
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:15.200]   time just to remember these things, and that we must never be guilty of divorcing our teaching
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:24.500]   from the facts on which they are based and from which they emanate. This is true history,
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   but history is not merely fact. It means fact plus interpretation of the fact, and we must
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.000]   always put these two things together. The facts alone are not enough. The interpretation
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.180]   alone is not enough. We want facts and interpretation, and having the two, we have a gospel which
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.460]   is solid and which is sure.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.020]   And so it's not surprising that the apostle thus looking at himself and seeing his end
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:56.460]   drawing near, seeing these infant churches and the forces that were going to attack them,
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.040]   these men saw that Greek philosophy was going to come and would try to take hold of the
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.020]   idea of Christianity and turn it into something else and leave the facts behind. They had
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:13.140]   all seen it. The apostle, you remember, Paul, tells us in writing to the Corinthians that
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:19.580]   when he preached the cross, he was very concerned that he shouldn't do it with human wisdom
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:25.260]   lest he should make the cross of Christ of none effect through philosophy. There are
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.920]   constant warnings about this. They saw it coming. The Holy Spirit had enlightened them,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.580]   and it's still with us.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:44.740]   So I say we go through the facts again and remind ourselves that this unique, this momentous,
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:53.760]   this almost incredible thing took place nineteen hundred and fifty-six years ago. One came
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:01.780]   into the world in a way and in a manner that none had ever come before. Not merely was
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:10.900]   he born, he came into the world. And he keeps on saying, "For this purpose I am come."
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:18.860]   He didn't begin there. He merely appeared there. He was in the beginning with God, co-equal,
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:30.260]   co-eternal, the everlasting God, the Son. But he came into time as the offspring of
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.900]   the virgin's womb.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:40.300]   Oh, my friend, if you and I but caught a glimpse of this, if you and I could but see this as
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:48.740]   it is and were able to grasp it, why, I say, our whole being would be radiated with a joy
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:59.140]   unspeakable and full of glory as we look upon this act of God on our behalf.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:06.540]   Well, now let me say just one word about the certainty of the facts. The apostle, you notice,
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.940]   is careful to tell them that. And you notice that he tells them that there are two main
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:19.700]   grounds for this certainty concerning the facts. The first is the apostolic witness
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.860]   and testimony. "We have not followed cunningly devised fables," he says, "when we made known
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:30.380]   unto you the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.980]   his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory when there came such
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   a voice to him from the excellent glory, 'This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.'
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   And this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount."
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:20:02.980]   Let's be clear about this. Our faith, our position, is finally entirely dependent upon
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:10.640]   the apostolic witness and testimony. Now that is something that needs to be said very frequently
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.700]   during these present days, with this folly that seems to have gripped us all, which leads
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.940]   us to think that every year is an advance upon the previous year, and that every century
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:29.300]   is an advance upon the previous century. We, in our ignorance and blindness, tend to think
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.980]   that because we are in the twentieth century, we know more about these things and have a
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:41.580]   profounder understanding than the apostles had because they only lived in the first century.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   And by believing that kind of thing, of course, we deny the Christian faith. What do you know
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:55.060]   about Jesus Christ apart from what these apostles have told you? We are dependent upon this
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:02.900]   witness, this testimony, the records produced by these men. These were the men whom he left
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:08.180]   behind to form and establish the church and to propagate his message, and he filled them
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:14.500]   with the Holy Spirit, and he guided them and led them in their recording of the facts concerning
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:24.020]   himself. We are dependent upon their testimony. A man like this Peter, whom he called at the
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:30.460]   beginning of his public ministry, and whom he chose, with James and John, to go up with
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:39.620]   him onto the Mount of Transfiguration. They had all been fumbling before that. They did
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.120]   not understand. They looked at him, they were amazed at him. Sometimes he did things which
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.660]   they could not understand. You remember Peter and the others had been fishing one night
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.940]   and had caught nothing. He sends them back to the same place and then they catch so many
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.060]   fish that they do not know what to do. And Peter, looking at him, said, "Depart from
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:04.860]   me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man." Something of his glory and his God had burst through,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.900]   and yet they did not understand it. And again it says the rare Philippi, "When our Lord
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.260]   asks them, 'Whom do men say that I am?' and they give their answers, he then says, 'Whom
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.540]   do ye say?' And Peter said, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And our
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.800]   Lord said, 'Flesh and blood doth not reveal this unto thee.'" But my father, which is
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.500]   in heaven, Peter did not quite know what he was saying, because the next moment he tries
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.660]   to reprimand our Lord when he begins to speak of his coming death. No, no, it was given
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.900]   to him in a flash and then he misses it. But there on the Mount of Transfiguration that
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.380]   extraordinary thing happened. They went up with him and suddenly they looked at him and
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.420]   they saw a glory which they could scarcely stand. His whole figure had been transformed
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:59.100]   and he was shining with a brightness and a glory above the brightest shining of the sun.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.020]   And Moses and Elias were speaking to him and a voice came from heaven saying, "This is
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:13.300]   my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear him." And they never forgot it. They
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:21.540]   had a glimpse of his unbeclouded deity and glory and eternal nature. And here he tells
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.300]   these people, "If anybody should query the facts," he says, "tell them that I saw it,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:35.940]   I heard the voice, I was there and James and John were with me." The apostolic testimony.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:42.380]   Is your view of the Lord Jesus Christ based upon the four Gospels? Or do you imagine that
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.780]   you have some kind of superior wisdom that enables you what to choose and what to reject
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:52.580]   out of those Gospels? And how do you know that what you choose is right if it all depends
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.280]   upon your judgment? It comes from the same source. The apostles who gave the teaching
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.500]   gave the miracles. They have given the virgin birth. They have given everything. And who
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.980]   are we to stand in judgment and say, "I believe this, I reject that"? We don't know. We are
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:17.500]   utterly dependent upon them. But in our supposed wisdom and cleverness, we deny the faith and
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:27.180]   rob him of his glory. Apostolic testimony. We saw, we heard these things. We have the
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.980]   record. Thank God for it. And the other way of substantiating it, if you remember, he
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:38.500]   tells us is this. We have also a more sure word of prophecy. "Whereunto we do well to
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.660]   take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:49.980]   day star arise in your hearts." Here's the second. Read your Old Testament. Make a note
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.740]   of the prophecies. And let us never forget this. The prophets were foretellers as well
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:02.180]   as forthtellers. Of course, the fashion today is to say a prophet is not really a man who
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:08.340]   foretells. He's just a man with great insight who gives a message for his age. I agree he
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:16.260]   does that, but he does something much more wonderful. He sees ahead. He foretells. And
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:24.900]   centuries before this event happened in Bethlehem, these men, inspired, moved by the Holy Ghost,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:32.620]   foretold his coming. Go through your Old Testament. Make a list on paper. Watch the promises starting
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:38.660]   in Genesis 3.15. "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head." Put it down. There
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:46.700]   it was given centuries before. Follow it on right through. And especially when you come
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:53.900]   to those great prophets whose writings we have in our Old Testament, they'll tell you
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:59.180]   that he was to come from the tribe of Judah. They'll tell you that he was to be born in
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.220]   Bethlehem. They'll tell you the time when it was to happen. Put them all down on paper.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.540]   Say, "Here are the prophecies." Then turn over to the New Testament. And as you come
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.860]   across the verification, take them off one by one. A word of prophecy made sure, made
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.220]   certain, verified, fulfilled. There's the promise. Here's the fulfillment. Do you want
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:27.300]   more than that? Can you explain this in terms of human wisdom and understanding? Of course
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:32.140]   you can't, says Peter, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.860]   private interpretation. What he means is this. He said, "These prophecies are not merely
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.140]   the excogitations of the minds of those men. They were not sitting down and trying to look
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.060]   into the future and predicting what's going to happen." Not at all. It's not anything
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:56.380]   in the man himself. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Prophecy
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:03.100]   came not in old time by the will of man. It's God revealing ahead of time. And when you
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:10.380]   put the prophecies and the facts together, you have an absolute proof, apostolic witness,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:21.020]   fulfillment of prophecy. And on that basis, we can rejoice and glory in these great facts,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.540]   starting with his birth on that first Christmas day.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:33.940]   One other word, and I'm finished. It's a word I must ask. There, I say, the Son of
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:43.780]   God came into the world, born of a virgin's womb. There he has humbled himself, laid aside
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:54.220]   mildly his glory, and has come as a man. Why has he come? Why did he do it? Why did God
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:28:01.740]   the Father ever send him? What's the meaning of all this? Is it merely a phenomenon? Has
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:07.860]   he merely come to teach? Has he merely come to give us an example? Well, let the author
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.780]   of the epistle to the Hebrews answer the question for us. The same answer is given by Peter,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:20.220]   by Paul, and by all the rest, but here it is very perfectly in Hebrews 2.9.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:30.820]   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels. Why? What for? For the suffering
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:42.020]   of death, now crowned with glory and honor, that he, by the grace of God, should taste
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:52.460]   death for every man. That's why he came. He didn't merely come to give us a display
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.780]   of the Godhead. He didn't merely come, I say, to teach and to give us that incomparable
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:06.220]   teaching in which we rejoice. He didn't merely come to give us the example. The primary
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:13.840]   object and purpose of his coming was that he might taste death for every man. He came
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:22.100]   into this world deliberately to die in it. Why? Because it is the only way whereby men
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:28.980]   can be reconciled to God. He was made a little lower than the angels, who was eternally above
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:37.580]   them as the sun, because it was essential that if he was to rescue and redeem fallen
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:45.220]   sinful human nature, he should in human nature take our sins upon himself and bear their
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:56.680]   punishment, and thereby reconcile us to God. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.700]   himself, not imputing unto them their trespasses. So that's the real meaning of Christmas.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.180]   Not a little message for children only, not some superficial philosophy of goodwill and
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.420]   of good cheer, and a little bit of happiness, and an attempt to bring men and women together.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:20.880]   No, no, it's infinitely bigger, it's infinitely more glorious. He came from heaven to earth
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:34.340]   to die for our sins, that we might be forgiven, that we might become the children of God.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:42.360]   We have not declared unto you cunningly devised fables. No, no. The one who literally was
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.700]   made flesh was literally crucified on a tree, and bore the agony and the ignominy and the
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:59.260]   shame of it all, and the spitting and the mockery. His heart broke, his body was broken,
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:08.540]   his blood was shed. Thank God for the facts. For face to face with these, I know that my
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:19.380]   sins are forgiven, and that I in Christ am a son of God. Blessed be God, who hath visited
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:25.260]   and redeemed his people. Amen.
