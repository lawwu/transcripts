[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and hopefully everybody is having a wonderful,
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.240]   wonderful summer.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.440]   It's August 16th, 2020 and the Nasdaq is up over 25%.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.400]   The S&P 500 is back to all time highs and the pandemic still rages on.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.600]   So frankly, it is unbelievable what's going on in the world today.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.360]   And I hope everybody's feeling better.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.520]   Hopefully everybody's healthy and hopefully everybody's net worth is close to or at all
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.480]   time highs as well.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.360]   So one of the things I've been talking about in my newsletter is how we should be more
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.060]   grateful to the Federal Reserve and the central government.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.400]   Because without them, without all their stimulus money, their enhanced unemployment benefits,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.520]   the stimulus checks to certain folks, I think the stock market would probably go down 50,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   60, 70%.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.440]   The real estate market may or may not tank because the bond market would catch a bid
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.120]   and interest rates would go way down.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040]   But I think overall, we'd be in a much worse place than we are right now.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780]   And so I think we should be thankful, thankful to the Fed for getting it, understanding and
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.260]   acting quickly that things are really, really bad.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.920]   But as soon as I said, hey guys, we should be thankful, I got a number of angry responses
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.080]   from readers who said, you know what, the Fed is just terrible for us, for the economy
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600]   and for the future.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.960]   One guy said they create debt, they print money, they weaken the dollar, and they create
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960]   socialism.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.020]   They also ensure there is an unhealthy power grab at the central government.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.020]   We now accept that the central government is the babysitter, mother and protector of
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.080]   us when we stub our toes financially, physically or by other means such as a national disaster.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.480]   And so there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the Fed and the central government.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.500]   And I find this response, frankly, quite interesting, because unless you think the central government
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.320]   manufactured this virus to unleash to the world, so we can have that power grab and
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.840]   control us all, I think what they're doing is very, very helpful to help stave off poverty,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220]   extended unemployment, you know, a decline in your wealth and housing and stocks and
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220]   so forth.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.560]   I think they are on the ball.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.200]   And without them, the world would be a much worse place.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.000]   But there is one thing the central government and the Federal Reserve have done.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.120]   And that is, that is they've made retiring early or retiring normally or staying retired
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.660]   much, much more difficult.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.680]   And the reason why is due to a record amount of stimulus being created in a shorter period
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   of time.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.080]   So interest rates have dropped faster than a cement block tied to a dead body thrown
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.240]   off a boat in the middle of Lake Tahoe by one of Capone's capos.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.640]   And so as a result, the 10 year bond yield is at about point 7% at the time of this recording.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.200]   And it did decline to about 0.51% a couple months earlier.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.160]   So at a 0.7% risk free rate of return, 1 million will only generate $7,000 a year in risk free
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   income.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   And that's pre tax.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.500]   So if you've got your home paid off, your health insurance covered, all your debt done
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.540]   and your kids are all grown up and independent, 7,000 a year plus Social Security will provide
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.400]   for a very simple retirement lifestyle.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.660]   Even if you got the maximum monthly Social Security payment of about $2,900 a month,
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.300]   that's about $35,000 a year.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.540]   Add on the $7,000 a year you get risk free.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.900]   Well $42,000 is not exactly living a large, large lifestyle.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.100]   Unfortunately, the average Social Security payment is closer to $1,500 a month instead.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.580]   So reality, the annual Social Security average benefit is closer to $18,000.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.880]   And that is if the Social Security program continues.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.240]   Right now it's underfunded by about what 25 to 30%.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.060]   So you might have to lop off 25 to 30% on your expected number just to be conservative.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.980]   And with all this stimulus being spent, eventually our kids or ourselves or our grandchildren
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.760]   will have to pay back all this debt.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.900]   And I know some of you guys are saying, look, well, interest rates are down.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.580]   That means that other risk assets are looking relatively more attractive because you're
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.300]   only getting so little in a risk free 10 year bond yield or a money market account.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.460]   So therefore, why not invest in stocks and real estate?
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.500]   And that's what you're seeing happening.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.060]   People are investing in the stock market more and in the real estate market more across
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.220]   the nation because interest rates are so low.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.780]   However, don't forget, if you are a retiree or you're planning on retiring in the next
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.540]   five years or maybe even 10 years, you are going to be more risk averse.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.580]   You're going to lower your risk profile because you don't want to rewind and go back in time
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.380]   and lose your money and then have to spend all that time to make up all your potential
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.380]   losses.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.380]   We're lucky, folks.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.580]   March 2020, we saw what, around a 32% decline from the peak to the trough.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.180]   I think it would have been down 60, 70% if the federal government and the Federal Reserve
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.780]   didn't step in.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   It's important to understand that the risk free rate of return, the 10 year bond yield
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.400]   is intertwined with risk assets and risk asset returns.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.660]   For example, a company looking to raise money to fund operations isn't going to issue a
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.100]   bond that pays 8% unless it's in very dire straits.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.740]   Instead, a company will probably discover that adding an additional 2% or 3% interest
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.460]   rate premium to the 10 year bond yield will garner enough demand.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.880]   Supply and demand, folks.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   Everything is relative.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.380]   If you think about it from a dividend paying perspective, companies, they've grown in value
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.700]   because their operations have grown, but also there's a large attraction to dividend paying
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   companies.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.140]   Now, in the past, maybe a dividend payout ratio was 80% and the yield would be somewhere
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.980]   around 3% to 4%.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.340]   But now with the 10 year bond yield at under 1%, senior management of the company is going
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.900]   to rationally think, "Okay, what is the lowest dividend payout ratio and the lowest dividend
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.820]   yield we can have so that investors still invest in our stocks, still hold our stocks,
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:41.340]   while the company also retains the most amount of operating capital to fund operations, expansion,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.780]   and so forth?"
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.980]   So logically, any rational management will start thinking, "Okay, let's cut the dividend
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.500]   payout ratio, let's lower the dividend yield because we don't have to pay as much.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.700]   Everything is relative because if they don't want us, well, the alternative is only earning
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.980]   0.7% in a 10 year bond yield or maybe other companies are paying 2.7% to 3.7%.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.780]   Now because our company is in a stronger financial position, I think we're going to be good enough
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.160]   with a 2.5% yield or a 2% yield from a 3.5% to 4%.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.940]   This is how management thinks.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.540]   This is how companies are run.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.100]   They need to find the optimal balance between attracting investors, attracting capital,
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   and running their operations and keeping capital to expand and maybe plan for a rainy day.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.340]   It is my belief that using the 10 year bond yield as a barometer for retirement income
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.340]   generation is conservative, but I also believe the ideal withdrawal rate in retirement doesn't
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.820]   touch principles as long as your estate is below the estate tax threshold.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.260]   In other words, if your estate is above $11.58 million per person, feel free to increase
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.580]   your withdrawal rate to whatever you want.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.300]   5%, 6%, 8%, 10%.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.380]   You got to do the math because paying a 40% death tax on every dollar above the estate
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.100]   tax threshold is a crying shame and nobody should do that.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.720]   If you die with too much money, you lose.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.980]   It's a waste of resources, a waste of time.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.300]   Might as well spend it on your children and charitable organizations now while you're
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.620]   still alive because it feels better and you can see the results of your giving.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.620]   Alright, so now we've come to the heart of the issue.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.100]   Why the 4% rule is outdated.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.940]   The 4% rule is based on the Trinity University study conducted by three Trinity University
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.820]   professors back in 1998.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:44.980]   So more than 22 years ago, folks, inflation and interest rates were much higher and pensions
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.740]   were very common then.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.540]   Pensions now, I think it's like under 16% of Americans are eligible for pensions.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.820]   And even if you're eligible for a pension, that pension amount is not going to pay enough
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.060]   to fund a normal retirement.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.300]   It's just going to be a small portion of it and it's just going to be cobbled together
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.540]   by a pension, your after-tax portfolio, and so forth.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.780]   So today is different from 1998, folks.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.780]   This is point number one.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.140]   The 4% rule is the most common safe retirement withdrawal rate cited, but it is outdated.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.660]   It is obsolete.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.360]   And the main reason why is this.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.540]   And we're going to go back to the 10-year bond yield, which I think is the most important
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.180]   financial figure to track.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.620]   It tells you everything, folks.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.020]   Lots of things because everything is intertwined in finance.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.700]   Back in 1998, the 10-year bond yield, also known as the risk-free rate of return, ranged
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.880]   between 4.41% to 5.6%.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.820]   So the average, let's say, was around 5%.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   Therefore, of course, you'd likely never run out of money in retirement following the 4%
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.780]   rule because back then you could earn 1% more on average risk-free.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.960]   Let me say that in a different way.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:10.340]   If you withdraw 4%, hey, don't sweat it because you can earn 5% risk-free and replenish a
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.100]   portion of your retirement portfolio.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.540]   And not only that, you probably had a pension that was guaranteed for life.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.780]   And not only that, Social Security was not as underfunded as it is today.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:33.240]   Following a 4% rate, no sweat because not only was the 10-year bond yield at 5%, you
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.680]   had dividend yields at 4% to 5%.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:43.400]   You had bond yields from treasury bonds to corporate bonds to municipal bonds.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   Many of them were generating over 4%.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   Municipal bonds, one of my favorite passive income sources, they're double tax-free.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   Back then, getting 4% plus double tax-free was highly feasible.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.440]   Today, not so much at all.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.840]   It is a different time, folks.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   Therefore, using the 4% rule that was created in 1998 for 2020 and beyond doesn't make any
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.200]   sense.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.720]   And what's more interesting is that despite this logic, that the risk-free rate of return
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.960]   was 25% higher than the 4% rule at the time it was created, I've received probably 70%
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.520]   of the comments in my post were negative.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's as if people cannot adapt, understand, and change.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.600]   And if you cannot understand, adapt, and change, you're going to get left behind.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.440]   Or you're going to put your finances at risk.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   Or you might just go extinct like the dinosaurs.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.320]   You've got to understand the economics of today and adapt.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's like being stuck on the fact that having a million-dollar net worth means that you
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.320]   are a true millionaire and you get all the spoils of what being a millionaire has historically
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.440]   been written about and talked about.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.120]   But think about it this way.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   Inflation.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.800]   Inflation, inflation, inflation.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.000]   If you were a millionaire in 1945, yes, you were rich.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.200]   Today, not so much due to the loss of purchasing power due to inflation.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:17.060]   So if you put a compound growth rate just based on inflation from 1945 to 2020, a million
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.960]   dollars back in 1945 is worth closer to about 14 million dollars today, folks.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.120]   I've written in an article that 3 million is the new 1 million.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.120]   But hmm, I think even 3 million is kind of like, let's just do the numbers.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.200]   Don't get upset.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.440]   Don't get upset at me or the reality.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:42.080]   Just run the numbers and you will see that a million doesn't buy what it used to 30,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.320]   40, 50, let alone 55 years ago.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.960]   OK, so let's say you agree that the 4% rule is irrelevant.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's obsolete.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.560]   So what's the new safe withdrawal rate to follow?
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.000]   I think that rate is 0.5%.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.440]   If you provide a similar 9% to 28% discount to the 10 year bond yield to come up with
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.360]   a safe withdrawal rate of 4% back in 1998, then the safe withdrawal rate in 2020 and
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.640]   beyond is equal to the 10 year bond yield times 72% to 90%.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.880]   And you thought I was overly conservative following a withdrawal rate based on the 10
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   year bond yield.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.220]   No, if we're going to be consistent with back in 1998 and the creation of the 4% rule, we've
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.440]   also got to take a discount.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.040]   Therefore, with a 10 year bond yield at about 0.7%, a safe withdrawal rate is actually closer
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.480]   to 0.5 to 0.63%.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.240]   When the 10 year bond yield was at its low of 0.51%, the safe withdrawal rate was equivalent
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.560]   to 0.36% to 0.46%.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.680]   So to make things simple and consistent, the new safe withdrawal rate equals the 10 year
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.080]   bond yield times 80%.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.440]   We'll use an average 20% discount to the 10 year bond yield to come up with a safe withdrawal
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   rate.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.040]   This 20% can be viewed as a buffer in case of financial emergencies, bear markets, a
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:13.320]   lost decade, poor spending habits, and a further decline in interest rates.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:20.440]   And if interest rates do decline by much greater than the 0.51% bottom we saw earlier in the
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.080]   year, then we're just going to use the formula and we're going to calculate our safe withdrawal
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.040]   rate accordingly.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:34.160]   Now I know what some of you guys are thinking right now, that I'm crazy, that the 0.5% rule
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.720]   is just way, way too conservative or way, way, way too aggressive, however you want
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.200]   to look at things.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.980]   But the reality is that's how things are today.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.120]   Interest rates have declined.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.000]   If you're angry, blame the Fed for bailing us out.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.160]   Blame the central government for doing whatever.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.480]   Don't get angry at me.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.800]   I'm just providing you some very logical financial perspective of why we should adapt and move
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.000]   away from the 4% rule.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.080]   Further I haven't had a job since 2012.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.640]   So it's been more than eight years of being unemployed or quote retired.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:16.080]   And I haven't told anybody I've been retired since 2013 because I felt it sounded silly.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.480]   And instead I told people I've been teaching tennis or I'm a writer or blogger or whatnot.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.320]   The point is I'm living this life and I'm giving you two perspectives.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.400]   One a logical perspective based on finances and one on perspective based on eight years
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.300]   of not having a job.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   And it is very different.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.040]   It's very different once you no longer have a job.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   All the emotions good and bad come emerging out of your body, emerging out of your soul.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.000]   And I've written about this before in articles such as the negatives of early retirement.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.200]   Nobody talks about it.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.320]   Nobody likes talking about it.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   I just share it.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.000]   I just say the good and the bad because I want you guys to make an informed decision.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.920]   Conversely it is very easy to pontificate about what your safe withdrawal rate should
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.680]   be in retirement.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.880]   How much you should have in your net worth so you can retire comfortably while you still
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.040]   have a day job when you have never experienced not having that safety net of health care
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.800]   benefits and a steady paycheck and a network of people who can provide you job opportunities.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.000]   It's very different folks.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.800]   I'm telling you right now you can only experience the true feeling of retirement once you have
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   burned your bridges.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   Right.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.520]   You don't have a paycheck.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   Nothing.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.000]   Even the Trinity study back in 1998.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.400]   This was done by professors.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.280]   Three professors who probably were all tenured professors who all had nice incomes and probably
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.760]   pensions so they were also pontificating.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.720]   What is the probability that you won't run out of money over a 30 year time period in
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   retirement when they were still actively working and doing what they love to do.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.800]   So the reason why I'm not angry or pissed off about the 0.5 percent rule is that it's
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.200]   just a guide.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   It's a guide.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.440]   It's not the end all be all rule for how much net worth you should have or what you should
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.120]   really withdraw while you're in retirement.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'm not pissed off at the federal government or the central government.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.440]   I'm happy that they're saving all of us.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:24.360]   The thing is 0.5 percent rule is still a higher withdrawal rate than I have withdrawn since
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   2012.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.440]   And I'm telling you this because when I left in 2012 I felt like we were kind of at the
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.820]   bottom of the market.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.920]   So the last thing I wanted to do with withdraw my retirement income because I had already
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.160]   lost a multiple six figure job income.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.720]   So instead I made it a point to just live off my severance and try to make active income
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.240]   through things that I enjoy doing.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   And the two things I enjoy doing most are teaching tennis and playing tennis and writing.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.560]   So I focus my attention on financial samurai and on teaching tennis and I also did some
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.760]   Uber driving here and there and so forth.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.480]   And what I did was I tried to make enough money to still save at least 50 percent of
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.280]   my active income while in retirement.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.960]   And here's a point a lot of people who talk about retirement who aren't retired cannot
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.560]   understand.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.720]   It's that if you've been saving a lot of money let's say it's 30 percent 50 percent 70 percent
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.960]   of your after tax income for let's say a decade or two decades.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.180]   It is very hard.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.800]   It is almost impossible for you to flip the switch and reverse and start drawing down
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.420]   principle.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:37.400]   And therefore once you do retire or reach financial independence you will see that the
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.560]   zero point five percent rule is really not that onerous because it could still be too
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.720]   high for you because you will refuse or you may refuse not to withdraw anything.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.640]   So you'll have a zero percent withdrawal rule.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.520]   Since 2012 I don't think I've met anybody who retired before the age of 60.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.360]   Stop trying to make some supplemental retirement income.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.280]   You know long gone are the days where you just retire and do nothing.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.160]   Nobody wants to do that anymore.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.320]   Because we're all interconnected.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.640]   We've got the Internet.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.260]   We've got a lot more freedom.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.240]   We've got a lot more productivity.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.120]   The natural tendency is for you to go and do things you enjoy.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.280]   And a lot of times those things you enjoy can pay an extra amount of money.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.080]   So for example one year I taught tennis as private lessons.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.760]   I think it was eighty dollars an hour for an hour and a half.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.360]   I wanted to do an hour and a half because those warm ups and so forth and I wanted to
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.560]   get a good amount of cardio exercise as well.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.760]   So if I did that let's say 10 hours a week that's not a lot of hours.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   10 hours a week a couple lessons a day during the weekdays.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.400]   That is eight hundred dollars in cash.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.920]   Eight hundred dollars in cash is a great amount of supplemental retirement income.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.400]   And if you don't like tennis you probably have something else you like where you can
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.600]   make a little bit of money as well.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   All right enough perspective.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.160]   Let's use the 0.5 percent rule to help figure things out.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.480]   You can use it as a net worth stretch target.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.520]   So with the 4 percent rule you multiply your annual expenses by 25 to get a target net
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.460]   worth with a 0.5 percent rule.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:21.000]   You multiply your annual expenses by 200 to get a target net worth.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   OK wow 200.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.000]   That is ridiculous.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.020]   That is so much.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:31.000]   For example our family let's say we want to live off 200 thousand dollars a year because
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.320]   this family of four and we live in an expensive city and we'll probably continue to live in
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.800]   an expensive city for the rest of our lives.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.520]   So 200 thousand dollars in annual expenses times 200 is 40 million dollars.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.760]   So wow that is a crap load of money.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.520]   As two unemployed parents amassing 40 million dollars.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.920]   It's going to be really difficult.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.100]   We've only got financial samurai to help us generate active income at the moment.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.480]   You know I got to decide and my wife has to decide do we want to try to shoot for 40 million
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.360]   to say that we're financially independent by going back to work for 10 hours a day for
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.560]   the next five to 10 years and then not seeing our children grow up as much.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.920]   I don't think so.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.920]   But again I'm just using the 0.5 percent rule as a way to come up with a stretch net worth
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.120]   target in this low interest rate environment.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.700]   And so should you.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.760]   All you got to do is divide your annual expenses by 0.5 percent to come up with your net worth
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.100]   stretch goal or more easily you can multiply your desired annual expenses and retirement
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.720]   by 200 to get to the same amount.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.200]   Now you've got a net worth stretch goal you can look at and say this is ridiculous or
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.600]   hmm maybe I will find a way to achieve those numbers.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.080]   Maybe I bet you're going to be more proactive in trying to figure out how to accumulate
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   more wealth.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.040]   And even if you don't get to that stretch goal that's fine it's a stretch goal.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.160]   What you've done is you've created more wealth than otherwise.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:07.960]   Now if you feel the stretch goal is too onerous based on the 0.5 percent rule you can generate
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.120]   supplemental retirement income to fill your income shortfall.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.160]   That is what every single person I know has done and is doing right now including myself.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.760]   For example let's say you want to live off 100000 a year in retirement.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.120]   Well according to the 0.5 percent rule this would equate to having a 20 million net worth.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.280]   Unfortunately you've been blindly following the 4 percent safe withdrawal rule therefore
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:41.780]   you thought accumulating 2.5 million was enough right 2.5 million that's 100000 times 25.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.760]   So you now realize after listening to this podcast and reading the Financial Samurai
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.240]   article the 4 percent rule was developed in 1998 when the 10 year bond yield averaged
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.880]   5 percent.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.800]   After you finish cursing me out privately but really you should be cursing out the Federal
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.640]   Reserve and the central government you calm down you think things through you listen to
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.000]   my voice and you figure out the gap.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.600]   So your 2.5 million can only safely generate 12500 a year right 2.5 million times 0.5 percent.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.920]   Therefore your retirement income shortfall is 87500.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.560]   How did I get that well it's 100000 which is your desired retirement income minus 12500
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.360]   which is your true retirement income.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.320]   Since you don't think you'll ever get to a 20 million net worth you need to find a way
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.960]   to make 87500 a year in supplemental retirement income.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   Thankfully there are many ways to make money from the comfort of your own home online or
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:51.800]   you can be a consultant a teacher whatever it is you're not nothing folks you have some
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.560]   type of interest you have some type of skill that you've built up over a 20 plus year period
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.600]   that is valuable that someone is willing to pay you for your skills.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.800]   So don't sell yourself short.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   Your experience has value.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.520]   You can always try and live on less or you can do a combination of both.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.480]   It's up to you to decide what's your ultimate combination.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.920]   And here's another way to use the 0.5 percent rule.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:22.240]   I'd like you to add up how much retirement income you already have and subtract it from
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.920]   your desired retirement income.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.320]   Just know that there is always a risk of existing retirement income declining especially with
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.720]   a decline in interest rates.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920]   Again we talked about everything being intertwined.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.480]   So for example my current retirement income is about 250000 a year.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.160]   My goal is to have a retirement income of 300000 a year.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.660]   So I'm 50000 dollars short.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.080]   So no problem.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.320]   Let's use the 0.5 percent rule.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.360]   I would need to amass an additional 10 million in net worth because 10 million comes from
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.760]   dividing 50000 by 0.5 percent or multiplying 50000 by 200.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.480]   Or I can simply find a way to make an additional 50000 a year in active income to live the
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.440]   life that I want.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.860]   Ideally you want to create active income after your career in an enjoyable way.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.080]   So if it wasn't for Finance Samurai I would try to make 50000 dollars a year teaching
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.400]   tennis and if it wasn't tennis I'd probably try to self publish another book.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.160]   And I've been saying this for years because it's such a no brainer way to make money from
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.140]   home and it's a passive income source but I'm just lazy.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.340]   So I need that kind of pain to jolt me into action.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.800]   And another way is to try to get a book deal with a traditional publisher and I might have
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   some news there.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   So stay tuned.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.180]   Bottom line your goal is to try and make income from things you enjoy doing because you can.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.280]   You have the freedom and ability to do so.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   So you will.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   All right.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   Let's say you are still flummoxed flabbergasted annoyed pissed off angry at the 0.5 percent
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   rule.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.480]   Well just think about it differently again.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.840]   Use the rule only as a net worth target.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.760]   Once you've reached your net worth target based on the 0.5 percent rule then you can
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.240]   change your safe withdrawal rate as you see fit.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.620]   For example let's say you are happy living off 50,000 a year in retirement.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.120]   You don't have a pension nor do you have any passive income.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   Aha.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.120]   That's tough.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.480]   The 0.5 percent rule says that you'll need to amass a 10 million dollar net worth.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.720]   Let's say you succeed in getting to 10 million by the age of 70 and expect to live until
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.400]   age 90.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.480]   With an expected 20 years left to live you could divide your 10 million by 20 and safely
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.280]   withdraw 500,000 a year.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.280]   Withdrawing 500,000 dollars a year is now equivalent to a 5 percent withdrawal rate.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.400]   Even higher than the 4 percent rule folks.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.200]   And if there's a bear market or a big unexpected expense during this time you can adjust your
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.080]   withdrawal rate accordingly.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.600]   None of us are zombies.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.720]   We can all adjust.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.480]   And none of us should look at the 0.5 percent rule as a rule.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.560]   We want to look at it as a guide folks.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.040]   As a guide to help you think.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.760]   The interest rate environment is entirely different from back in 1998.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.120]   The economic environment, the information environment, it's all very very different.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.920]   So you must adapt.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.640]   Depending on how much of your wealth you want to pass on the 0.5 percent rule may be too
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.480]   aggressive or too conservative.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   Only you can decide.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   At the minimum I hope most of you will at least agree that the 4 percent rule is obsolete.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.240]   If you hear someone really pitching the 4 percent rule and he or she is not retired
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.760]   or jobless then I would look at it with a grain of salt.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.820]   Ask him or her how do you know?
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.520]   What is your experience with early retirement or retirement in general?
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.760]   How have you withdrawn your money?
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.740]   What have you done to make supplemental retirement income?
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.820]   If they don't have the answers then I don't think you should listen to them.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.000]   The clear alternative is to learn to live happily on less.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.600]   Living happily on less is a great way to feel much richer and it feels much lighter.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.380]   Sometimes we just accumulate too much stuff, we buy too many things and it just becomes
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.380]   a burden.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.900]   The stuff that we own ends up owning us.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:26.300]   One of the riskiest things about personal finance is that there's no rewind button.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:32.480]   It's much better to retire or reach your financial independence age with a little too much than
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.100]   a little too little.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.260]   As you age time gets more and more valuable because you have less of it.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.180]   The last thing you want to do is rewind time to try to make more money or make up for those
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180]   losses.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:50.020]   We're absolutely spoiled here in this stock market and real estate environment.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:55.440]   Don't think you can't lose because as soon as you start thinking that way your risk exposure
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.060]   gets out of whack and you could lose very very big.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:05.140]   I want you guys to think about the 0.5% rule when coming up with a net worth target and
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.720]   a safe withdrawal rate.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.700]   You can choose 4% if you want.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:16.180]   I think probably 2.5% is probably the highest I would go in this environment because remember
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.740]   stocks and real estate and other risk assets can go down folks.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   We could have a lost decade on our hands.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.180]   So I hope everyone appreciated this ad free podcast.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.460]   It's 30 minutes long.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:36.060]   It's a long one and it took hours to write the proper safe withdrawal rate post as well.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:41.400]   I really appreciate all positive reviews on iTunes, Google Podcasts, Spotify and so forth.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.900]   It keeps me going because goodness knows I've got a lot to deal with and manage with two
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.140]   young kids at home.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.820]   Stay safe everyone.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.820]   Keep thinking.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.820]   Keep commenting.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.700]   Keep sharing your thoughts and hopefully everyone has an open mind.
