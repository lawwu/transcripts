[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140]   - Let's talk about working memory.
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.380]   Some years back, but still now, you use working memory tasks and experiments in your laboratory.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.140]   If you would be so kind as to explain what working memory is, and then I'd love to talk
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.680]   about some of the work you've done exploring the role of dopamine in working memory, because
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.260]   this is so critical to everyday life.
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.780]   And I know dopamine is a bit of a buzzword these days, but the listeners of this podcast
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.860]   anyway are pretty sophisticated in terms of knowing that dopamine is not just about reward,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980]   it's about motivation and goal-directed behavior.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.080]   And I think dopamine intrigues for a good reason, that it does govern a lot of our quality
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   of life.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.880]   So what's working memory?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.280]   - Yeah, I mean, working memory, it's interesting, I started studying it about 30 years ago,
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.060]   and I don't think I realized how important it was when I started, but what we mean by
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.920]   working memory is this ability to hold information in mind when it's no longer accessible to
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]   us.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.100]   So if you tell me your telephone number and I have to put it into my phone, you know,
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.280]   it's no longer there, you just told me, but I'll hold it in my working memory until I
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.980]   can punch it into my phone.
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.120]   It doesn't have to be something that comes from the outside world.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.120]   I could hold up, you know, I can pull up my own, if I'm filling out a form and I want
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.280]   to pull up my social security number, I can hold that in mind too until I put it down.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.320]   So when you think about it, it's a very important, you know, ability that we have that we do
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   very flawlessly.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.800]   And what I've learned more about working memory is the working part of it.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   It's not just this passive holding information in mind, but it's being able to do things
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.000]   with the information.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.980]   It's being able to, you know, when we do a math problem, which we don't do that much
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.720]   now that we have calculus, but if you do that in your head, you're able to sort of manipulate
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.940]   the information and do the different parts of the problem.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.400]   Or even if you're, you know, you're trying to find someone in a crowd and you're holding
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.880]   onto some face, you're able to hold that face in mind and cross check it and search.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.080]   And so there's operations to working memory.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   It's not just, you know, it's not just this passive maintenance.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.360]   So when we started to think about working memory in that way, we started to realize
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.960]   how important it is for, it's, you know, I think of it as the foundation for cognition.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.160]   Just think about reading comprehension.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.960]   You can't understand this conversation if you can't hold in mind what's going on, you
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440]   know, earlier in the conversation or when you're reading a book, you know, or remembering
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   the sentence before it.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.760]   So it just predicts all these abilities that allows us to read, to plan, to organize, and
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.320]   all the sort of executive functions that we're doing, right?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.720]   We have to hold in mind rules.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.080]   We have to hold in mind goals.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.960]   We have to hold in mind all of these things in order to just carry out behavior.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.520]   You know, so it's really come a long way in terms of how people are thinking about it.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   I know that Matt Walker said that, like, you know, sleep is our superpower.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640]   But I guess one way to sort of use this term, while we're awake, working memory is really
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.960]   our superpower because it allows us to translate, as we said, sort of our knowledge into action
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   by holding this information in mind as we're thinking about what we want to do.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.820]   If we're going to think about dopamine in the context of working memory, is dopamine
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.400]   an accelerator on working memory?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   Is it a facilitator?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   I mean, what is dopamine doing for working memory?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.300]   And maybe we could talk a little bit about the circuitry.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.920]   I've talked about dopamine before on this podcast, but there's a good chance that some
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.080]   of the people listening to this haven't heard those episodes.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   So maybe we could just quickly review the three major circuits for dopamine and the
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.760]   one that's relevant for working memory.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.800]   Let me start with the working memory, the circuitry for working memory, because one
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.520]   of the important things about working memory is the other type of memory is long-term memory.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   You can—working memory's short-lived.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.720]   It's only as long as you're able to rehearse it, and then it disappears, whereas what we
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.680]   call long-term memory, if I—remembering what you had for breakfast or your vacation,
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   this is information that gets consolidated and gets put into a more durable form that
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.200]   we call long-term memory.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.040]   And the interesting thing about memory is that these are separate systems.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.320]   Everything from working memory just doesn't pass into long-term memory.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.120]   They're two completely different systems and two completely different parts of the brain
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.200]   that seem to control it.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.160]   So working memory, the frontal cortex seems to be very important for working memory.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.360]   When we are holding information in line, the neurons, the brain cells in the frontal lobes
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.120]   are active, and they stay kind of active as long as we're holding on that information.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.380]   And they're more active when the information is relevant.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.160]   And if we get distracted, they'll get less active.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.400]   So the frontal lobes kind of track your—track the memory that you're holding in mind.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.440]   Another important thing about the circuitry is that if we're holding in mind, say, digits,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   the phone number, well, that information's in your back of the brain.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.820]   And so the frontal lobes is sort of keeping information in the back of the brain active
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.760]   because it's connected to the visual areas.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.440]   It's able to sort of keep that information active.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.520]   And so what we've learned is that there's not these buffers in the brain where, you
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.800]   know, if you're holding verbal information, it's in this little buffer, and if you're
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.520]   holding visual information, it's in another buffer.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.720]   The whole brain acts as a buffer, and the frontal lobe can call up any part of the brain
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.000]   and keep that part of the brain active as it's trying to hold this information in line.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.280]   So the mechanism for working memory is just this persistent neural activity within the
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.480]   frontal lobes.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   And so then the question is, what does dopamine do?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.480]   Well, dopamine is one of the neuromodulators that are made in the brainstem, and it projects
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.000]   up to different parts of the brain.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.840]   There's a system that goes up into what we call the basal ganglia, which is important
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.160]   for motor function.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.760]   And there's another dopaminergic system that goes up to the frontal lobes.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.480]   And what was discovered was that if you deplete dopamine, working memory drops.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.640]   You get a significant impairment in working memory if you deplete dopamine, and if you
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.560]   replace it, then your working memory will be improved.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.720]   And so dopamine seems to be a modulator to help this persistent activity stay persistent,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   you know, during the time that you need to keep this information in mind.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:35.320]   Am I reaching too far to draw an analogy between dopamine's role in working memory, that is,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.960]   to keep information online, and the other established role of dopamine, which is for
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.400]   movement, for the generation of smooth movement, as evidenced by conditions like Parkinson's
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.440]   where people lack dopaminergic neurons or have damage to dopaminergic neurons and have,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.500]   you know, challenges in generating smooth movement.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.200]   What I'm essentially asking is, can we think of dopamine as facilitating physical movement
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.520]   through one circuit, but also kind of mental movement, thought movement, and I'm thinking
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   about for those just listening and not watching, I'm kind of rubbing my index and middle finger
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.360]   against my thumb, so just keeping something online, it's sort of a movement of thought
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.160]   or information, and then you kind of chuck it away and bring out the next information.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   Is that appropriate?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.660]   - Yeah, I think that's a good way of thinking about it.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.780]   And one might wonder, well, how can dopamine be important for memory, but also be important
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.780]   for movement?
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.040]   And it's really simple, it's just that it's acting on different circuits.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.240]   The neurons that go to the motor areas that carry dopamine will, when dopamine is expressed
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.680]   there and boosted there, then it will be involved in movement and lack of dopamine in the basal
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.840]   ganglia will lead to neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, that has severe
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.760]   movement difficulty.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.440]   But when it's acting in the frontal cortex and expressed in the frontal cortex, then
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.880]   it's going to improve working memory.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.960]   So it's just the nature of where the circuits are, where the dopamine is, that's allowing
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.560]   it to have different kinds of actions, and that's for all transmitters.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.520]   The reason why acetylcholine seems to be more important for long-term memory is because
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.440]   it's projecting to the hippocampus, which we know is another area that's important for
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   memory.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.000]   And that's why acetylcholine doesn't boost your working memory, but dopamine does and
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.640]   vice versa.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.320]   - So drilling a little bit more deeply into the role of dopamine in working memory, you
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.920]   did some really lovely experiments showing that if people who have low levels of dopamine
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   increase their dopamine pharmacologically, I think the drug that was used was bromocriptine,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.360]   that working memory improves.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:52.440]   Conversely, if one depletes dopamine pharmacologically, working memory gets worse.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:59.500]   But as I recall, there was an important baseline that is important because it really mattered
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   in terms of the outcome.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.400]   Meaning if somebody already had relatively high levels of dopamine in this circuit, increasing
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.080]   dopamine further with bromocriptine didn't impart a benefit and might've even made their
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720]   working memory worse.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.320]   So there's a kind of inverted U-shaped function to this.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:24.200]   How does one know whether or not their baseline dopamine is low, medium, or high?
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.400]   Ergo, how do they know whether or not they would want to explore going about increasing
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.640]   dopamine through any number of different approaches?
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.640]   - Right.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.960]   Well, most people probably have optimal dopamine, but there's a significant percentage that
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.440]   probably have too little or maybe too much.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   And unfortunately, we can't measure it in the blood.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.080]   There isn't a blood test that I'm aware of that can measure dopamine because it's stuck
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   in the brain.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.200]   - Peripheral dopamine in the blood is not a good readout.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.440]   - It's not a good readout, yeah.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.800]   And especially when you're talking about dopamine in areas like prefrontal cortex.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   And so we don't have a good readout there.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.760]   There's invasive procedures like positron emission tomography where we can inject a
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:15.880]   radioisotope that tags dopamine, and then we can do a scan that actually shows us how
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.280]   much dopamine.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.920]   This scan was originally developed to show Parkinson's disease, that you can diagnose
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.240]   Parkinson's disease by showing that there's less dopamine in patients that have Parkinson's
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.360]   disease by looking at this scan.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   Obviously it's invasive.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.880]   You're injecting a radioisotope, it's expensive, and it's not something we could all do.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   But we had used it to show that it correlates very strongly with your working memory capacity.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.240]   So how much information you can hold online, if you can hold four or five or six letters
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.880]   when I do a span task, correlated with how much dopamine we can see in the PET scan.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.560]   So that would be a way that we could do it.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.760]   - So if you were to read out a string of a few numbers or letters, and I can remember
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:08.720]   all of those a few moments later, perhaps, perhaps my baseline dopamine levels are moderate
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.440]   in the normal range.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   Whereas if I couldn't keep that online, that might be reflective of lower baseline dopamine
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   levels.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Is that right?
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   - Yeah.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   It's a very strong proxy for dopamine.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.560]   So if your working memory capacity is seven letters, or numbers, when I say 437-1506,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.760]   if you get that, get them all back to you pretty quickly, you probably have more baseline
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.320]   dopamine than someone who has five.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.840]   So it's a proxy for measuring someone's dopamine.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   So that's one way to do it.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.680]   And that's actually how we did it in our original studies.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:50.960]   We actually grouped individuals based on whether their capacity, based on this behavioral measure,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.140]   was high or low.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:59.140]   And like you said, those that could only hold five or six letters, if we gave them bromocryptine,
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.980]   which was the dopaminergic agonist, we improved their working memory.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.260]   We got them into sort of an optimal level.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.420]   But those who were already high, we actually got them worse.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.780]   And the moral of that story was that more is just not better.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.460]   We're trying to get people optimal.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.740]   And so the real question is, if we want to get people optimal, like you were inferring,
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.740]   we have to know what their dopamine is.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.060]   Where are you on this inverted U-curve?
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.640]   Another way of doing it is through genetic studies.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:39.340]   So dopamine, all neurotransmitters have to be broken down and reuptaked into the brain
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.420]   cell in order to be used again.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.780]   And there's different ways of doing it.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.900]   In some cells, it gets transported back into the brain cell.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.900]   In other places, there's an enzyme that breaks it down.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.660]   Well, there's an enzyme called COMT that breaks down dopamine in the prefrontal cortex
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.660]   specifically.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:04.500]   In a large percentage of individuals, that enzyme is either overactive or underactive.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.660]   Probably about 25% of individuals, it's overactive, and another 25%, it's underactive.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.340]   So probably half the population.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:19.460]   Now, this is going to vary, depend on where you live and where you come from and things.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.060]   But maybe half the population either has an underactive enzyme or overactive enzyme.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.060]   If you have an underactive enzyme, then actually more dopamine sits around and you actually
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.620]   have more dopamine than others.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.620]   And if you have an overactive enzyme, it's the opposite.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.180]   So we've actually shown that if you now go and genotype people with a simple saliva test
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.940]   and figure out, do they have this genetic, what we call polymorphism, where just one
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   amino acid gets changed and the enzyme becomes either active or underactive, we can do the
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.060]   same thing as grouping them by their capacity.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.140]   Those that have the low dopamine, we will make them better.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.020]   And those who have sort of baseline high dopamine, we'll make them worse.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:11.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
