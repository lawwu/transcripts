[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.840]   - Welcome to the "Bogleheads" chapter series.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.520]   This episode was jointly hosted
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.560]   by the Minnesota and Detroit chapters
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   and recorded March 27th, 2021.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.480]   It features Mike Piper, the oblivious investor,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.440]   discussing social security claiming
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   and portfolio management.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.920]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.640]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.920]   This recording is for informational purposes
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.240]   only and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.960]   Please note, this recording began
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840]   a few minutes into the presentation,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540]   but nothing important was omitted.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.200]   - It means that taking the money
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.240]   and investing it becomes more attractive.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.680]   Of course, right now the opposite is true,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.320]   so that's a point in favor of waiting,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680]   but if you're 50 right now
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.120]   and you're going to be making this decision
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.080]   12 years in the future,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   well, interest rates might look very different
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.120]   than they do right now.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440]   So when we move on to the more complicated situation
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.360]   of a married couple,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.360]   the rough draft plan here
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480]   is generally for the higher earner to wait
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.280]   all the way until age 70
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.480]   and for the lower earner to file as early as possible
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.760]   or close to age 62.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   And the reason for this,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080]   it has to do with the way that survivor benefits work.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.440]   And specifically,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   what ends up happening
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.640]   is that once either of the two spouses dies,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.720]   the surviving spouse generally
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.880]   is left with the larger of the two benefit amounts.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.600]   It's the smaller one that disappears
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.520]   once one of the two spouses dies.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.200]   So in other words,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520]   when the higher earner waits to take benefits,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680]   it increases the household benefit
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.280]   for as long as either of the two people is alive.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880]   So if the higher earner waits,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.800]   it increases their own retirement benefit.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.640]   But if that higher earner dies first,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   well, then the lower earner
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   will now start getting a survivor benefit
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   that is increased
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.240]   as a result of the fact that the higher earner waited.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.280]   So the higher earner waiting
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   increases the household benefit
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.160]   for as long as either person is living,
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.560]   or you could look at it
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   as it increases the household benefit
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.360]   until the point at which both people have died.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.120]   Now, on the other hand,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.200]   when the lower earner delays benefits,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.520]   it only increases the household benefit
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   for as long as both people are alive.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.200]   And it's basically the opposite reason.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.160]   It's if the lower earner delays,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.560]   that increases their retirement benefit.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.400]   But if they die,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.000]   then that benefit's no longer relevant.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.320]   And if the higher earner dies first,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   then the lower earner's benefit
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.120]   will get stepped up to
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   what the higher earner had been receiving.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.640]   So again, when the lower earner waits,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.120]   it only increases the amount that the household gets
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.480]   while both people are still living,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.600]   or until the point at which one person has died.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.040]   And the key point here
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.720]   is that until both people have died
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.120]   is a longer period of time
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.680]   than until one person has died.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.200]   And that's why it's generally advantageous
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.680]   for the higher earner to wait.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760]   And I think it's kind of intuitive
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.360]   to look at this visually.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.240]   And I think of there's basically four broad scenarios
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.800]   that can happen when you have two people.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   It's a two by two matrix basically.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   In the one corner,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.800]   you have the case in which both people live
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   beyond their life expectancy.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   And in the opposite corner,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.520]   you have the case in which both people died
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.440]   before reaching their life expectancy.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.720]   And then in the other two corners,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.400]   you have the case in which one spouse dies early
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   and the other person lives beyond their life expectancy.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.200]   Now, when we're looking at these four options,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   or these four possible cases,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.560]   for the filing date for the higher earner,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.960]   we're concerned with how long it will be
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.040]   until both people have died.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.880]   So in other words,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.720]   what we're asking is how likely is it
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.600]   that at least one person will live a long time?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   Because if at least one person lives a long time,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.840]   then it will have made sense
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.160]   for the higher earner to have waited to file.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   So if we look at these four scenarios,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.200]   we can see that in three of them,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   at least one person lives past their life expectancy.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.640]   It's basically just the one case
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.960]   in which they both die early that that doesn't happen.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.800]   So in other words,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.480]   there's about a three out of four chance
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.160]   that at least one person lives beyond their life expectancy,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.320]   and that's why it's advantageous
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.800]   for the higher earner to wait to file for benefits.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.440]   But then if we look at it again
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.760]   with the decision for the lower earner in mind,
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.360]   now what we wanna know is how likely is it
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.480]   that at least one person will die
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.120]   before reaching their life expectancy?
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.800]   Because if at least one person dies early,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.280]   then it will have been advantageous
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.760]   for that lower earner to have filed early.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.320]   So we look through our four possible outcomes here,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.520]   and in three out of the four, somebody dies early.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.480]   So there's a roughly three out of four chance
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.440]   that at least one person dies
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.040]   before reaching their life expectancy,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.640]   which is why it's usually advantageous
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.400]   for that lower earner to start their benefit early.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.880]   And for those of you who like to look at it
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.080]   with actual numbers, this is just one basic example.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.120]   It's a married couple, husband, wife,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.080]   they're both exactly the same age, it's 62,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.240]   and they're both in exactly average health.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.120]   In this case, the husband's individual life expectancy
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.120]   is 20 years, so he would be expected on average
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.320]   to live until about age 82.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.760]   And the wife's individual life expectancy is 23 years,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.080]   which means she would be on average
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.920]   expected to live until about age 85.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.980]   Now, with regard to that lower earner's decision,
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.000]   what we wanna know is how long will it be
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.120]   until somebody has died?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.320]   And a lot of people look at these two pieces of information
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.840]   and they think the answer is 20 years,
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.320]   but that's not the answer,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.280]   because remember, there's about a three out of four chance
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.240]   that somebody dies early.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.640]   And in fact, when you actually use mortality tables
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.480]   to answer this question,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.760]   it turns out that in just 16 years,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.140]   it's more likely than not that somebody has died.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.280]   And so that's, again, why the lower earner
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.520]   usually wants to file early.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.480]   And if we look at the question for the higher earner,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.840]   so we ask how long will it be on average
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.760]   until both people have died?
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.320]   A lot of people intuitively assume the answer is 23 years,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   but by now you're probably catching on
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.160]   that that's not the answer,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   because there's a three out of four chance
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.400]   that somebody lives past their life expectancy.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.780]   So on average, it turns out that it's about 27 years
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.760]   until both people have died.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.220]   And that's why it's so advantageous
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.280]   for the higher earner to wait.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.320]   That's why we have this rough draft plan
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.520]   where the higher earner waits as long as possible,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.600]   so they file at 70, and the lower earner files early,
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.040]   often at 62, or if not at 62,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.840]   at least in the early range, roughly.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.160]   But of course, there's plenty of exceptions.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.920]   One important exception,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.960]   and this applies to a lot of bogleheads,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.580]   is that if both people are just in very good health,
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.580]   or if you are just particularly concerned about longevity,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.620]   then that's a point in favor of the lower earner waiting.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.040]   And the flip side, of course,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.160]   is that if both people are in very poor health,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.360]   then you would probably want
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.200]   to take the higher earner's filing date
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   and move it earlier somewhat.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.720]   Again, another exception is the minor child
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.500]   or adult disabled child scenario,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.240]   because in that case, it might be a point in favor
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.720]   of the higher earner filing sooner,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   because if they were to do that,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.880]   that would allow the child to get child benefits
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.100]   on that higher earner's record at an earlier age.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.200]   So it might make sense to do that.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   Another important exception
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.560]   is if the lower earner is still working,
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   then we have to be thinking
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.280]   about the social security earnings test.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.200]   And I'm not gonna get into the math of that.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.440]   The open social security does,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.200]   the calculator does account for that, by the way,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.500]   if you tell it that you're still working
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.520]   and you put in the amount that you're earning
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   and when you expect to stop working.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.920]   But the result is basically that.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.720]   It usually makes sense for the lower earner
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.240]   to then wait either until they stop working
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.040]   or until their full retirement age to file for benefits.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.080]   Another possible exception is if one
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.440]   or both spouses have a government pension,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   then we have to be thinking
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.120]   about the windfall elimination provision
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.360]   and government pension offset.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.160]   And the calculator accounts for these two,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.220]   if you tell it that you have a pension.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.680]   This is a bit tricky to summarize in any concise way,
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.720]   because it can affect the decision
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   in either direction for either person.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.000]   One last exception is tax planning.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.680]   Usually that's a point in favor of waiting.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.840]   And the reason for that is
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.960]   that social security is inherently tax advantaged,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.520]   because at most 85% of your benefits are included
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.200]   in your taxable income.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.600]   And depending on how high your income is,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.200]   in many cases, less than that would be included.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.040]   And so when you wait to file for benefits,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.960]   basically what you're doing is increasing the portion
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.800]   of your lifetime income that is coming
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.440]   in the form of social security.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.720]   So you're increasing the portion
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.960]   of your lifetime income that is tax advantaged.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.360]   So that's usually a point in favor of waiting,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.120]   but tax planning is always case by case.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.240]   So there could be some other tax specific reason
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.600]   that would be a point in favor of filing early.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.760]   So that's it for the question of social security.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   Now, if we move on to the second question
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.760]   of how much you can spend per year from your savings,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.480]   if you've spent much time on the forum
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   or just reading about retirement planning in general,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.000]   you've probably run into the 4% rule.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.080]   And the idea there is that
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   if you spend 4% of your portfolio balance
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.480]   in the first year of retirement,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.240]   and then every year,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.040]   the idea is that you would keep spending
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.160]   that same dollar amount, except you would adjust it upwards
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   for inflation every year.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   And you do that regardless
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.400]   of how the portfolio is performing.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.880]   So even if the portfolio is going way up or going way down,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   you just keep spending the same inflation
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.440]   adjusted dollar amount.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.880]   That's the idea of this 4% rule concept.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   But there's a bit of an issue.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.360]   And I think most people realize this
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.120]   as soon as they try to apply it in real life,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.360]   which is that most people in real life
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.960]   don't actually spend the same amount
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.320]   from their portfolio every year.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.160]   And that's because you have different sources of income
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.800]   that stop and start at different ages, right?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.280]   You might, for example, if you're married,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   you might have one person retires,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.440]   but the other person is still working.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   So maybe you're spending a little bit from your portfolio.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.880]   And then the second person retires
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.200]   and now you're spending more from your portfolio.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.520]   And then social security starts
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.200]   and now you're spending less from your portfolio.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.040]   And the 4% rule just doesn't account for that in any way.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.640]   And then there's also just the fact that for a lot of people
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.520]   they just want to spend more money
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.080]   early on in retirement, right?
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.160]   Like traveling more, going out to eat more,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.080]   going out to shows more,
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.720]   doing whatever it is that you like doing.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.760]   A lot of people intentionally plan to do more of that
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   in the early years of retirement.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.360]   And so again, we have a case where
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.800]   you just aren't spending the same dollar amount
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.360]   from your portfolio every year.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.120]   So how do we address that fact?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.240]   How do we actually incorporate that fact into a plan?
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.680]   I think the easiest way to do it
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   is actually to bundle in the third question as well
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.120]   of which assets you should be spending.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.760]   Because there's a very straightforward approach
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.280]   that can address both of these questions together.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.440]   And essentially the idea is to recognize
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.520]   that your portfolio is being asked
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.800]   to satisfy separate spending goals.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.320]   And those spending goals last for different periods of time.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.200]   And so if you have any spending
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.720]   that's only supposed to last for a short period of time,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.240]   you can use an allocation that's a good fit
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.120]   for a short period of time.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.760]   And that piece of the portfolio
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.520]   that's going to satisfy this short-term spending,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.240]   you wouldn't be using something like the 4% rule.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.760]   You would intentionally be depleting
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.200]   that piece of the portfolio according to a schedule.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   So you would intentionally be spending from it
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.440]   at a high rate.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.640]   For example, if something's supposed to last for four years,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.080]   you would be spending from it at 25% per year.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.680]   And then for the rest of the portfolio,
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.720]   the portfolio that's supposed to last
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.360]   through your whole lifetime,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.880]   that's where you generally want to use
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.920]   a stock-oriented allocation
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   and a low initial spending rate.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.200]   So it's three to 4%, depending on who you ask.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   So I know this isn't very intuitive,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   so it's actually much easier to explain it visually.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.960]   So what we have here,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.680]   imagine that this is your desired total level of spending
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.840]   per year in retirement.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.320]   And the idea is that you are intending to spend more
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.480]   in the first part of retirement
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.840]   than in the later part of retirement.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.200]   And in this particular example,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.360]   it's just one decline at one moment in time,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.840]   but it could be a gradual decline over several years.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.160]   It doesn't really change the concepts.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.200]   It's just trying to keep the example simple.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.120]   And there's no numbers on the age axis.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.400]   And that's because it doesn't really matter
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.080]   whether this decline in spending happens at age 72
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.360]   or at age 83.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.840]   The concepts are still basically the same.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.240]   And there's no numbers on the spending axis either,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240]   because it doesn't really matter
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.840]   whether this is $50,000 or $500,000 of spending,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.640]   the concepts still basically the same.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.040]   So the idea is that every year,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.560]   you have to come up with enough dollars
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.800]   to get you up to that line,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   to get you up to your desired total amount of spending.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:16.280]   But the key point is that it doesn't all have to come
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.960]   from the portfolio,
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.880]   because at some point,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.760]   your social security benefits going to start,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.600]   and it's going to get you part of the way up to that line.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.760]   And if you're married at some point,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.440]   the other person's social security benefit begins.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.360]   So it gets you even further, closer towards that line.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.640]   And so it's just the rest of the area,
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.960]   the green space basically,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.480]   that has to come from the portfolio.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.680]   And so at the beginning of retirement,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.480]   it is every dollar of spending
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.440]   that comes out of the portfolio,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.560]   but then it's a little bit less
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.760]   because you have some social security coming in,
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.600]   and then it's even less
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.280]   because you have more social security coming in,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.160]   and then it's even less
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.920]   because now you've reached the point
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.880]   where you just aren't planning to spend as much per year.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.040]   So the level of spending here from the portfolio,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.160]   you can see that it's fluctuating quite a lot over time.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.520]   And that's why the 4% rule or even similar concepts,
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.640]   they just kind of break down
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.840]   when you try to apply them here.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.860]   But the other thing you might notice
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.420]   is that in this scenario,
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.140]   this person has the potential
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.340]   for massive sequence of returns risk
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.020]   because they're spending from their portfolio
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.740]   at the fastest rate early in retirement.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   And so this initial spending rate might be way above 4%.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.100]   It could be six, seven, 8%,
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.220]   depending on how much of the total spending
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.980]   would be coming from social security later.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.960]   And so this is a risky case
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.100]   because if the portfolio declines significantly
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.900]   early in retirement,
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.740]   and you're spending from it at a high rate,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.780]   you can run into a scenario basically
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.900]   where the portfolio gets depleted really far, really quickly,
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.420]   and you have a real problem.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.300]   So the solution, again,
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.260]   is basically to separate out the portfolio
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.980]   into separate chunks
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.580]   to satisfy these different pieces of spending.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.640]   So for example, the extra spending,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.840]   if you look in the bottom left corner,
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.080]   the extra spending that comes from the portfolio
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.280]   until that first social security benefit starts,
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.860]   if that's three years, for example,
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.840]   then you would use something
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.320]   that's a good fit for three years,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.080]   like a three-year CD ladder.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.900]   And I think it's often helpful here
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.000]   to just forget about retirement planning for a minute
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.600]   and just think about basic personal finance.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.380]   If you had some money
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.380]   that you were going to spend completely
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.820]   over the next three years,
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.140]   how would you invest it?
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.180]   You probably wouldn't put it in the stock market.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.420]   You'd probably use something like a three-year CD ladder,
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.900]   and that's basically what we're doing here.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.340]   And then if the piece of the portfolio,
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.700]   the extra spending that's going to happen
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.800]   until the second social security benefit starts,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.900]   if that's seven years,
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.460]   you might use a seven-year CD ladder
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.580]   or a seven-year bond ladder.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.040]   And then the extra spending in early retirement,
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.240]   just until the desired total level of spending
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.840]   has come down.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.080]   If you imagine that's 15 years,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.200]   you could use a 15-year bond ladder
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.760]   or maybe an intermediate-term bond fund,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   something like that.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.440]   And then it's really just the rest of the spending,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.000]   the rest of the portfolio where we have some questions,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.040]   because those CD ladder pieces and the bond ladder pieces,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.160]   they pretty much solve themselves, right?
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.660]   If you know that you're going to spend
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.020]   this particular chunk of money over four years,
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.760]   a four-year CD ladder is an obvious solution,
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.380]   and the spending rate is obvious as well.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.820]   You just spend one of those four CDs every year.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.420]   So for the rest of the portfolio,
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.220]   that's where we have more questions.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.740]   And that's where you want to be using
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.780]   a low initial spending rate.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.900]   So depending on what assumptions you're using,
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.940]   some people say it should be 3% right now.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.220]   Some people say 4%.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.420]   Some people are saying even higher than 4%.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.840]   But a low initial spending rate.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.120]   And that's where you generally also want to be using
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.280]   a stock-oriented allocation,
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.040]   because this is the piece of the portfolio
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.720]   that basically has to last indefinitely.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.620]   Because no matter how old you get,
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.320]   you don't know how much longer you have left.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.120]   And so you need this portfolio
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.560]   to last essentially indefinitely.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.840]   So with this rest of the portfolio chunk, basically,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.300]   one strategy that has grown a lot in popularity
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.500]   over the last 10 years,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.580]   and you'll see this in a lot of the research lately,
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   is to base your spending on the RMD tables.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.700]   And for those who aren't familiar,
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.700]   RMD just stands for Required Minimum Distribution.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.180]   And this has to do with retirement accounts,
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.540]   basically traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b).
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.700]   Once you reach age 72,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.340]   you have to take money out of that account every year.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.580]   And the amount that you have to take out
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.400]   is a percentage based on your life expectancy.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.380]   So the older you are, the more you have to take out.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.060]   And the idea of using this as a spending strategy
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.640]   is that every year,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.780]   you would just look up the RMD percentage
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.580]   for somebody your age,
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.260]   and then for this rest of the portfolio piece,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.020]   that's the percentage that you would spend.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.700]   So it's pretty straightforward.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.780]   It's basically just a percent of portfolio strategy,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.700]   but it adjusts for age,
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.740]   meaning that it's adjusting for the fact
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.260]   that the older you are,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.100]   the greater the percentage of your portfolio
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.200]   that you can spend.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.660]   So if you imagine somebody who retires early at age 50,
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.260]   and compare that to a 90-year-old retiree,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.180]   the 90-year-old can spend a greater percentage
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.580]   of their portfolio safely every year
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.180]   because they don't need it to last for as many more years.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.620]   And this strategy of basing spending
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.260]   on the RMD tables, it reflects that fact.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.060]   This slide basically just shows
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.060]   what the percentages would be at various ages.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.020]   And the thing I want you to notice
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.220]   is that it's a pretty conservative rate of spending.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.620]   You're spending less than 3% until you reach age 64,
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.380]   and you're spending less than 4% until you reach age 73.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.220]   And so what some people have decided to do
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.340]   is basically take this concept,
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   but just crank the numbers up a little bit.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.140]   For example, they might say,
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.780]   "We're going to spend the RMD percentage times 1.2,"
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.100]   or something like that.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.780]   And of course, that's a trade-off, right?
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.340]   It means you get to spend more,
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   but because you're spending more,
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.460]   you're increasing the likelihood
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.560]   that the portfolio ends up being depleted.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.500]   And on the topic of asset allocation
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.600]   for this rest of the portfolio piece,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.780]   you generally want to be using
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.880]   an equity-oriented allocation.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.020]   You wouldn't want, for instance,
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.100]   you wouldn't want to make a bond ladder,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.020]   like a 23-year bond ladder,
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.660]   because if you live 27 years,
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.580]   then you have a problem, right?
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.860]   So the idea is that for a portfolio
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.500]   that has to last indefinitely,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.020]   stocks are the best fit for that.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.740]   But if you look at the research,
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.060]   you'll see that there's a really broad range
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.680]   in terms of what gets recommended.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.520]   With some studies,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.260]   you might see a 40% stock allocation recommended.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.940]   You might see that with target date funds, for instance.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.700]   Other studies will recommend all the way up to 100%
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.320]   in stocks for this piece of the portfolio.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.360]   And the reason for that is just because
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.180]   if you're looking at historical data,
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.460]   it depends a lot which periods you look at,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.280]   and it depends what assumptions you're making, right?
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.800]   If a particular study assumes
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.880]   that the stocks are all US stocks,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.340]   whereas another study uses
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.260]   an international allocation as well,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.220]   it's gonna vary in terms of what it shows.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.480]   So a broad range is acceptable,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.660]   but generally something with a stock-oriented focus
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.780]   is usually what works best.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.980]   Now, of course,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.380]   a high stock allocation means more volatility.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.140]   And the other thing that it usually results in
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.780]   is a larger bequest,
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.860]   so a larger portfolio balance at death,
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.000]   or more spending later in retirement.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.020]   What surprises a lot of people
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.260]   is that using a higher stock allocation
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.260]   doesn't really let you spend more early on in retirement.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.540]   A lot of people assume that it would
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.780]   because stocks generally have higher expected returns.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.260]   But the problem with that
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.500]   is that stocks obviously don't always earn great returns.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.980]   And so with a stock-heavy portfolio,
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.460]   you basically have to plan to get unlucky.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.240]   You have to spend at a conservative rate
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.660]   and assume that you're going to get unlucky
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.260]   and spend at a rate that would be okay in that scenario.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.600]   But then what usually does happen
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.700]   is that you probably won't get really unlucky.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.020]   You probably won't have a huge bear market
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.480]   right after you retire.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.540]   And so what usually happens
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.900]   is that the portfolio grows over time
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.300]   if you have a significant stock allocation.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.660]   And so that means that you can spend more later on
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.060]   in retirement or leave more to your kids
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.020]   or grandkids or charities, basically.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.340]   So moving on to question number four.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.980]   Yeah, what's up?
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.180]   - I'd like to give a chance.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.700]   There was one question that came in
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.260]   that I think is a good one,
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.940]   and you've covered multiple topics already.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.140]   And I think the crux of what the question is
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.140]   is what are we talking about generally
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.020]   for the magnitude of difference
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.620]   between these multiple decisions we have to make
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.140]   that you just mentioned?
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.640]   Are we talking about if you make the correct decision
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.300]   with your spouse and who files early,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.040]   are you gonna get twice as much money, 10% more money?
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.980]   And the same sort of question would just generally go
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.380]   for the sequence of returns risk
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.540]   that you were just talking about
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.860]   and then this asset allocation decision.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.860]   - Yeah, so on the topic of social security,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.260]   it's super case by case.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.780]   Because the difference in earnings history matters a lot
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.940]   and the difference in ages
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.660]   between two spouses matters a lot.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:31.380]   The simplest case, so for a single person,
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.380]   like I said, filing later is slightly advantageous,
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.460]   not wildly advantageous.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.500]   It's just that life expectancies are a little bit longer
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.720]   than those that are baked into the system.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.100]   So you're going to get somewhat more on average if you wait
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.820]   and how much more depends
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.380]   on what mortality assumptions you're using.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:59.060]   For a married couple, generally what you'll see
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.900]   is that having the higher earner delay
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.140]   is extremely advantageous
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.780]   because you have the same fact
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.420]   that life expectancies are somewhat longer
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.740]   than those built into the system.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.080]   And there's the fact that, again, for that higher earner,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   we're looking at until both spouses die period of time.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.960]   So it's super-duper advantageous,
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.240]   but to put a number on it, unfortunately you can't
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.920]   because it depends entirely on the difference in ages,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.840]   the health assumptions that you're making
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.800]   and the difference in earnings history.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.640]   For the lower earners decision though,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.340]   what you'll find is that filing early
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.160]   is usually very slightly advantageous.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.400]   It's pretty close to neutral
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.080]   because you have this one point
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.360]   that filing earlier is advantageous
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.620]   because of the way survivor benefits work,
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.960]   but there's the countervailing point
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.480]   that life expectancies are longer
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280]   than those assumed in the system.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.720]   So it's almost neutral for the lower earners decision.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.120]   It's usually you get a little bit more on average
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   by filing earlier, but it's not gonna be a huge difference.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.300]   But again, to put any numbers on it,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.780]   you just can't do it without knowing
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.300]   an exact couple that we're talking about.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.940]   In terms of which assets to spend from
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.580]   and how much to spend every year,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:32.380]   I'm not sure exactly how to answer that.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.660]   Certainly, if we're talking about a scenario
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.920]   in which you are going to be spending
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.040]   well above 4% in those early years,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.160]   basically until social security kicks in,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.280]   that absolutely can be okay.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.720]   If what's going to happen then
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.040]   is that once social security does start,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.680]   the spending rate that you're left with is pretty low.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.760]   But in that case, what you have to do
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.400]   is just what we were talking about.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.580]   Basically take a chunk of the portfolio
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.960]   that's specifically allocated to something very safe
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.700]   so that essentially for that piece of the portfolio,
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.400]   sequence of returns risk is eliminated
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.620]   because you just have a bond ladder or a CD ladder
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.560]   and you know that money will be there.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.080]   That's in the research over the last few years,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.880]   you'll see the term social security bridge
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.420]   or bridge payment used to describe that concept.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.180]   I don't know if that answers the question or not.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.920]   - Yeah, I think it did to some degree, so thank you.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.160]   - Sorry, it's hard to answer
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.920]   to put numbers on that particularly.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.100]   - Yep, understandable.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.420]   - So as far as which accounts to spend from,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.180]   generally, this is about tax planning.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.000]   And in most cases, your taxable accounts
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.640]   are your least tax efficient accounts.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.000]   And the reason for that is that
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.640]   you have to pay tax every year on the rate of growth.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.680]   You have to pay tax every year on the interest
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.400]   that you're earning, unless you're using tax exempt bonds,
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.520]   but those pay less interest to begin with.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.120]   So again, you have a lower rate of growth.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.600]   And depending on your income level,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.080]   you might have to pay tax on dividends
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.300]   and capital gains as well.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.560]   So taxable accounts generally grow at a lower rate,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.680]   which makes them less tax efficient.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.360]   And that usually means that you wanna spend
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.400]   those accounts first.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:31.920]   Anything in tax planning though, there's always exceptions.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.040]   One big one in this case is that if you have assets
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.540]   that already have large unrealized capital gains,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.640]   so they've gone up in value quite a bit
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.600]   since when you bought them,
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.440]   and you're pretty sure that you could leave
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.880]   those assets to your heirs.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.920]   So you know you're not gonna be spending
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.260]   your whole portfolio during your lifetime.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.920]   In that case, it usually does make sense
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.120]   to try not to spend those assets.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.000]   And the reason for that is that when you die,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.840]   your heirs would get a step up in cost basis.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.000]   Basically, when they inherit those assets,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.120]   their basis would be stepped up to the market value
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.440]   when they inherit those assets.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.760]   And so basically, the idea here is that
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.380]   if you never sell the asset during your lifetime,
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.920]   you won't have to pay tax on the capital gain,
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.520]   and neither would your heirs.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.960]   They could inherit it and sell it right away,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.280]   and they wouldn't have to pay tax on the gain either.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.800]   So after taxable accounts,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.520]   the things that most people have, of course,
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.920]   are Roth accounts and tax-deferred accounts
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.560]   like traditional IRA and 401(k).
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.600]   And the decision here in terms of how much to spend
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   from each of these two types of accounts,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.600]   it's overwhelmingly a function of your marginal tax rate,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.020]   which is just the rate of tax that you would pay
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.200]   on an additional amount of income.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.560]   So for example, if 1,000 additional dollars of income
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.240]   caused your taxes for the year to go up by 300 bucks,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.960]   that means you have a 30% marginal tax rate.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.500]   And the general approach is that basically,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.440]   you would compare your current marginal tax rate
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.080]   to the marginal tax rate that you expect to have
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.960]   later on in retirement.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.600]   And if your current marginal tax rate is lower
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.280]   than that future anticipated marginal tax rate,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.160]   that means you wanna spend
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.240]   from tax-deferred assets right now instead of Roth assets.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.880]   And the idea here is you're basically saying
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.280]   my tax rate right now is low,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.100]   so I'm going to take advantage of that low rate.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.640]   I'm going to take money out
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.460]   of these tax-deferred accounts right now
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.960]   and pay tax now at this low rate
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.000]   so that I don't have to pay tax later at a higher rate.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.960]   And this is a very common thing
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.360]   in real-life financial planning
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.840]   because what usually happens
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.140]   is that you retire at a given age,
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.560]   so your income has gone down dramatically
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.480]   because you've stopped working
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.960]   and social security hasn't started yet
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.600]   and RMDs don't start until after that.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.520]   So you've got this window of time,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.660]   a period maybe of several years or a year or two,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.660]   where your income is lower than it has been
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.040]   and lower than it will be in the future.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.920]   And that usually means a lower marginal tax rate.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.080]   And so that usually means it makes sense
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.820]   during those years to spend primarily
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.720]   from tax-deferred assets
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.380]   and maybe do Roth conversions as well,
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.540]   which is where you move money
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.640]   from a tax-deferred account to a Roth account
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.140]   and pay tax on it when you do that, generally.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.740]   And the idea there is basically the same thing.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.980]   You're saying I'm going to pay tax now at my low rate
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.700]   so that I don't have to pay tax later at a higher rate.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.220]   And then any years where the opposite is true,
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   so any time where your current tax rate
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.140]   is higher than you expect it to be later,
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.300]   that means you would want to spend
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.100]   from Roth assets right now.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.140]   And the idea there, it's basically the opposite.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   You're saying my tax rate right now is really high.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.500]   So I'm going to try to keep my taxable income really low
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.020]   so that I don't have to pay any more tax
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.240]   at this high rate than I really have to.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.540]   - Yeah, hey, Mike. - Yep.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.180]   - Question came in, what if capital gains rates
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.220]   increase in the future, what would that do
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.780]   to the strategy you just laid out here?
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.460]   If you knew with a certain confidence capital gains rates
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.860]   are possibly going to be going up at some point.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.360]   - It basically just amplifies the desirability
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.820]   of spending down taxable accounts first.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.420]   That makes your taxable accounts even,
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.460]   they're already your least tax-efficient accounts
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.980]   most likely, and it would make them even less tax-efficient.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.860]   So it would make it even, it's already probably advantageous
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.940]   to spend those accounts first,
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.760]   and it would make it even more advantageous
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.260]   to spend those accounts first.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:33:02.420]   Now, an important thing to know about this
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.460]   is that it's not, some people misunderstand it
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.480]   and think that it's just a year-by-year analysis
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.940]   where for instance, you might say,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.100]   this year we're going to spend entirely from Roth
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.400]   or entirely from tax deferred.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.900]   But in reality, at least in theory, oops, sorry.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:25.780]   In theory, it's a dollar-by-dollar analysis.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.580]   So you would theoretically for every dollar of spending,
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.580]   you would be saying, should this come out of tax deferred
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.740]   or should this come out of Roth?
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.460]   And of course, no one's actually going to do dollar-by-dollar
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.540]   'cause that would take forever,
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.920]   but you might do thousand-dollar increments
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.300]   or 5,000 or 10,000 or whatever you pick
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.660]   based on your total spending level
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.980]   and based on how much time you want to put into it.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.420]   But the key point is that basically in a lot of years,
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.180]   you spend from tax deferred up to a point
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.560]   because the more you take out of tax deferred,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.060]   the higher your marginal tax rate gets in most cases.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.700]   And so it often makes sense to spend from tax deferred
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.380]   until you reach a particular threshold
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.060]   where your marginal tax rate would go up.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.580]   And then once you've hit that threshold,
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.940]   basically you would spend from Roth
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.180]   for the rest of the year.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.100]   And this is something I harp on on the forum all the time,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.140]   but it's really important.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.980]   It's that your marginal tax rate,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   it's not just the same thing as your tax bracket.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.700]   A lot of people just assume,
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.220]   for instance, I'm in a 22% tax bracket,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.500]   so I have a 22% marginal tax rate,
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.180]   but that's not the way it works in a lot of cases,
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.960]   especially in retirement,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.260]   because there's a whole bunch of things in our tax code
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:45.260]   where having some additional amount of income come in,
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.180]   it causes the normal amount of tax
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.860]   based on your tax bracket,
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.300]   but it also causes something else bad to happen.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.260]   It causes you to become ineligible for a particular credit
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.300]   or a particular deduction maybe,
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.940]   or it causes some whole other type of tax
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.100]   to kick in basically.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.920]   And so when you account for those two effects together,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.180]   your marginal tax rate can be considerably higher
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.520]   than just your tax bracket.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.580]   Some things that can cause that effect,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.980]   the premium tax credit.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.340]   So this is for people buying health insurance
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.620]   on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.420]   That's especially important for anybody retiring before 65.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.860]   The way that social security benefits are taxed,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.700]   that causes an effect like this also.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.420]   The Medicare income-related monthly adjustment amount,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.580]   which we'll talk about in a second,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.740]   causes an effect like this.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.220]   The 3.8% net investment income tax
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.100]   causes an effect where actual marginal tax rate
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.740]   is higher than just your tax bracket.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.220]   And really anything in our tax code
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.740]   that phases in or phases out based on your income level,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.220]   it's going to cause an effect where your tax rate,
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.940]   your actual tax rate will be different
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.060]   than just your tax bracket.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.260]   Now, this is another thing that I know isn't very intuitive.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.500]   So let's go through an example.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   Let's imagine basically a single retiree who is age 70.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.360]   And so they're already on Medicare, right?
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.500]   And they're already receiving social security.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.060]   And let's assume it's $30,000 of social security
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.300]   that they're getting per year.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.540]   And we're also going to assume
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.420]   that there's nothing else complicated,
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.060]   no other complicating factors
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.460]   in this person's tax planning picture.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.540]   So this is like the simplest retirement tax planning scenario
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.740]   that you would ever see.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.320]   And if we wanted to draw a chart
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.380]   of this person's marginal tax rate
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.080]   at different levels of income,
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.520]   most people assume it would look like this,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.300]   basically just stairs
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.400]   that reflect the different tax brackets, right?
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.100]   As this person's income goes up,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.620]   they go into the next tax bracket.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.740]   So their marginal tax rate goes up accordingly.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.180]   And that's reasonable to expect
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.940]   that that's what it would look like.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.180]   But it doesn't look like that.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.100]   It actually looks like this.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.860]   And this piece right here,
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.820]   it's known as the social security tax hump.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.660]   And it's the result
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.900]   of the way that social security benefits are taxed.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.780]   And the way that works is that if your income is low enough,
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.180]   none of your benefits,
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.180]   none of your social security benefits
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.260]   are included in your taxable income.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.420]   So they're totally tax-free.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   But then as your income proceeds through a certain range,
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.660]   every additional dollar of income causes either 50 cents
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.200]   or 85 cents of social security to become taxable.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.180]   So basically through this range of income,
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.460]   every dollar of income is causing income tax
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.500]   based on your tax bracket,
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.940]   but it's causing even more tax
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.100]   because it's causing some social security to become taxable.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.500]   So that's why your actual marginal tax rate
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.900]   is way higher than just the tax bracket that you're in.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.180]   But then what eventually happens
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.340]   is that your income reaches the point
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.620]   where 85% of your benefits
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.660]   are included in your taxable income,
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.340]   which is, that's the most that's ever allowed
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.500]   to be included in your taxable income.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.340]   So then this effect goes away
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.500]   and your marginal tax rate comes back down.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.780]   And then you'll notice the four straight up and down lines.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.340]   They are the result of Medicare IRMA,
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.300]   income-related monthly adjustment amount.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.420]   And that has to do with Medicare premiums.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.740]   And the way that that works
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.640]   is that your Medicare premiums for a given year
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.940]   depend on your income level from two years prior.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.740]   So a person's 2021 premiums
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.280]   would depend on their 2019 amount of income.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.900]   And the key thing to know about Medicare IRMA
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.460]   is that it isn't a gradual effect.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.380]   There's just specific thresholds
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.780]   where once your income crosses that threshold,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:04.220]   your premiums two years from now go up dramatically.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.820]   They'll go up by several hundred dollars
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.020]   or more than $1,000 over the course of the year.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.700]   So basically this $1 of income
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.860]   that puts you right over that threshold,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.780]   it's costing you hundreds or thousands of dollars
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.100]   in health insurance premiums.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.620]   So it's a marginal tax rate that's,
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.540]   it doesn't fit on the chart.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.940]   It's just a straight up and down line, basically.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.980]   And like I said a minute ago,
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.880]   the idea here is that basically every year in retirement,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.900]   you would create a chart like this, in theory at least,
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.060]   to show what your actual tax rate would be
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.940]   at different levels of income.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.900]   And then you would pick one of these thresholds
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.780]   and try to keep your income just below that threshold
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.700]   so that you don't get hit
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.220]   with that higher extra amount of tax.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:52.700]   And of course, a CPA, CFP, tax attorney,
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.460]   somebody like that can help you with that analysis.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.180]   But if, obviously a lot of bogleheads are do-it-yourselfers.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.000]   And so if you're going to take the DIY approach,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.960]   what I would encourage you to do
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.200]   is not to try to do all the tax calculations
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.520]   in a spreadsheet because almost every time
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.760]   when I see people do that, they leave something out.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.800]   They forget about a particular deduction
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.400]   or a particular credit or some phase out range.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   And so they miss one of these thresholds.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.780]   They don't recognize that it's there.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.500]   And then you accidentally take too much out of tax deferred
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.600]   or you do too much Roth conversions
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.960]   and you blow right through that threshold
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.880]   and you end up paying more tax than you had to.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.160]   So what I would encourage you to do instead,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.040]   if you're taking a do-it-yourself approach
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.200]   is to use actual tax software.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.720]   So it could be something as simple as just TurboTax,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.120]   just your basic tax prep software.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   And what you can do with that
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.600]   is just create a hypothetical return every year.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.440]   Basically you say,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.260]   this is roughly what we think our income will look like.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.880]   And then you can start to fiddle with it.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.680]   Basically you can say,
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.040]   but what if we did another thousand dollars
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.960]   of Roth conversions this year?
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.800]   How would that change our taxes?
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.320]   And then you just, you type that in
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.800]   and it shows you immediately
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.320]   how your actual taxes would change.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.480]   And because it's TurboTax,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.560]   it is accounting for all the deductions and credits
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.360]   and so on, all the other gauchos.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   And so you can see what your actual marginal tax rate
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.080]   would be for that thousand dollars of income.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.120]   And then you do it again.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.760]   You say another thousand and another thousand
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.200]   and you can figure out your actual marginal tax rate
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.520]   at different levels of income.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.520]   But the one thing that you would have to manually include
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.200]   if you're doing it that way
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.120]   is the Medicare IRMA that we're looking at right here,
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.960]   because that's not technically a tax, right?
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.720]   It's Medicare premiums.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.240]   So TurboTax isn't, it doesn't care about that.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.560]   So it's not going to tell you about that on its own.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.880]   So you would have to manually include that in your analysis.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   Now, one more point about this topic of marginal tax rates
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.200]   and how that influences the decision
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.300]   of which accounts to spend from every year
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.640]   is that for a married couple,
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.560]   what usually happens when one spouse dies
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.320]   is that the surviving spouse is left
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.020]   with a higher marginal tax rate going forward.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.760]   And the reason for that
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.680]   is that the standard deduction for one person
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.520]   or a single filer is half of what it is
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.480]   for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.040]   And up to the 32% bracket,
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.320]   each tax bracket has half as much space in it
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.600]   for a single filer
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.240]   as for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.720]   But when one spouse dies,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.560]   the usual result is that the household income
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   falls by less than half
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   because it's generally the smaller of the two,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.240]   social security benefits goes away, right?
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.360]   And then with regard to the portfolio income,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.320]   it usually doesn't really change all that much at all
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.040]   because just because somebody died,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.600]   I mean, the portfolio is still there, right?
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.720]   It's still there doing what it does.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   And so you have half the standard deduction
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.200]   and half as much space in each tax bracket,
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.320]   but more than half as much income.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.920]   So the result is often the surviving spouse
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.500]   has a higher marginal tax rate after that point.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.360]   So the implication there is that it often makes sense
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.720]   during the period that both of you are retired
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.200]   and both of you are alive,
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.920]   it often makes sense to do somewhat more
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.160]   tax deferred spending and likely Roth conversions
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.920]   than you would if you weren't accounting for this fact.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.280]   Now, in fairness, I should note
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.960]   that this is not a very precise analysis
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.080]   because of course you don't know really
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.960]   how long you're both going to live
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.920]   or how long just the one person is going to live after that.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.680]   So there's a lot of guesswork involved here,
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.080]   but even when you recognize
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.120]   that there's guesswork and uncertainty,
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.280]   it still usually makes sense to do somewhat more
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.040]   Roth conversions or tax deferred spending
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.480]   when you're both still alive.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.720]   So just to summarize this,
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.960]   which accounts to spend from topic,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.420]   taxable accounts are usually the least tax efficient.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.520]   So you usually wanna spend from them first.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.300]   An exception would be highly appreciated assets.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.820]   You often want to try to plan to leave those to your heirs
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.140]   or donate them to charity.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.220]   And then with regard to spending from Roth
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.380]   versus spending from tax deferred,
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.460]   it's pretty much about your marginal tax rate.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.100]   And generally, if your current marginal tax rate is lower
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.840]   than you expect it to be later on,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.020]   you wanna spend from tax deferred right now.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.740]   And if the opposite is true,
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.660]   so if your current marginal tax rate
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.620]   is higher than you expect it to be later on,
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.580]   then you wanna spend from Roth right now.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.020]   So just moving on to the last question,
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.140]   and we're gonna go through this one pretty quickly.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.840]   Insurance during retirement.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.920]   That's not, your insurance needs basically aren't the same
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.180]   as they are during your working years.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.100]   Life insurance, for instance,
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.840]   you generally don't need it in retirement
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.260]   because the whole point of life insurance
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.320]   is to protect people who are financially dependent upon you
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.200]   in the event of your death.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.700]   But usually by the time you're retired,
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.060]   nobody is financially dependent upon you.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.100]   One big exception is for a married couple
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.820]   in which one person has a pension
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.600]   and the survivor benefit is pretty low,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.300]   then you might wanna buy life insurance
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.580]   on the life of the person with the pension.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.000]   Another big exception would be
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.620]   if you do actually have dependents.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.120]   So if you have a minor child or an adult disabled child,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.740]   then you likely would want to have life insurance
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.380]   in order to financially provide for that person
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.720]   in the event of your death.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.220]   Long-term care insurance.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.820]   This is almost everybody I know hates talking about this
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.020]   because there's nothing really good to say.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:02.200]   If you're single, one strategy that might make sense
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.100]   is just to count on Medicaid,
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.200]   by which I mean you're basically betting
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.460]   that either A, you won't need long-term care,
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.300]   B, if you do need long-term care,
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.940]   you won't need it for very long,
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.140]   so you can just pay for it out of pocket,
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:22.140]   or C, if you do need it and you need it for a long time,
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.140]   then you would be okay with spending down your assets
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.600]   to the point at which you would qualify for Medicaid
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.700]   and Medicaid can pay for it going forward.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.580]   Of course, an important point to note with that plan
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.260]   is that Medicaid doesn't cover
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.460]   every type of facility out there.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.540]   So you would want to make sure that you are okay
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.480]   with the facilities that Medicaid does cover.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.860]   And then of course, for a married couple,
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.440]   that strategy doesn't work nearly as well
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.420]   because if one spouse needs long-term care
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.260]   and they end up spending down the portfolio
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.900]   to the point at which they qualify for Medicaid,
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.040]   that leaves the other spouse without a whole lot to live on.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.180]   So there's more use for insurance products
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.780]   for a married couple, basically.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.540]   So you've got the traditional
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.140]   long-term care insurance option,
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:19.500]   although a lot of insurers aren't providing that
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   at all anymore, they're not even offering it.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.540]   And of course, you've probably heard
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.820]   that for people who have those policies,
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.140]   they've generally been hit
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.800]   with pretty significant premium increases,
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.140]   which leaves you without any particularly good options.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.060]   You can either just pay the higher premium,
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.420]   abandon the policy,
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.340]   or choose to have your benefits cut, basically.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.200]   None of those feel very good.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.820]   Another option is hybrid policies.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.380]   So either annuities or life insurance policies,
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.500]   basically with the long-term care rider.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.660]   So it's a rider that says that if you need long-term care,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.360]   then the policy will pay a certain amount of benefits.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   But just like with any insurance product,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.100]   they're priced in such a way
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.220]   that's going to be profitable on average
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.620]   for the insurance company, right?
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.140]   On average, it's a losing bet for you
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.680]   and a winning bet for them.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.420]   And so that generally means
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.860]   that if you have enough of a portfolio
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.820]   that you are very confident
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.500]   that you could just pay for long-term care out of pocket,
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.300]   that usually means that you wouldn't want
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.680]   to buy a policy of that nature.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.300]   If you wouldn't be able to pay for it out of pocket,
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   you have more use for insurance,
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.260]   but even still, it's the options,
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.700]   just they are not all that great, unfortunately.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.460]   They leave something to be desired.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:49.620]   Disability insurance is usually a pretty easy question
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.940]   because the whole point of disability insurance
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.840]   is to replace your income from your work, right?
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.020]   If you're still working, you get disabled,
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.020]   you no longer have income.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.580]   So disability insurance protects you in that scenario,
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.780]   but if you're not working anymore,
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.140]   you don't really need that.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.580]   Health insurance.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.180]   Of course, if you retire before 65,
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.660]   most years are generally gonna be buying insurance
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.460]   on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:17.700]   So as a tax planner,
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.100]   the thing I'm always thinking about there
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.160]   is the premium tax credit.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.620]   That's the tax credit that basically reduces your premiums.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.060]   It's a subsidy against your premiums,
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.180]   and it's based on your income level.
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.040]   And health insurance is expensive, right?
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.580]   Especially the older you get.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.340]   So this can be a really, really big credit.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.660]   And the more...
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.940]   It's worth paying a lot of attention to, that's all.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.540]   It's worth really thinking about
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:50.060]   navigating your distributions from your accounts
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.660]   in such a way that you might want to keep your income low
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.380]   during those pre-65 years in order to maximize that credit.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.200]   After 65, of course, that's where Medicare kicks in.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.960]   And so again, that's where you want to be thinking
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.720]   about the income-related monthly adjustment amount.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.600]   And remember, that's the one where it's specific thresholds
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.040]   where as soon as you cross that threshold,
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.440]   your premiums go up quite a bit.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.360]   So if you can keep your income
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.020]   just below one of those thresholds
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.580]   rather than just above it,
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:22.620]   that's generally quite advantageous to do so.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.800]   As far as longevity insurance,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.320]   so things that protect you in the event
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.480]   that you live a really long time,
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.120]   that's where annuities come into play.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.540]   Obviously, bogleheads don't really love most annuities.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.160]   And the thing you'll see people say on the forum a lot,
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.900]   which is true, is that delaying social security
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.380]   is usually the best annuity deal that you can get.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.480]   And again, that's because most insurance products
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.240]   are priced in a way that's profitable
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.500]   to the insurance company,
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.240]   but that's not true with social security.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.560]   So it's usually a better deal
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.640]   than you could get from an insurance company.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.920]   However, if you're already delaying social security
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.760]   and you want more longevity protection,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.860]   that's where an annuity might be helpful.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.300]   And the type of annuity
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.320]   that's generally considered bogleheads approved
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.640]   is the basic single premium immediate annuity,
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.040]   which is a very simple product.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.400]   It's just the pension that you buy
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.680]   from an insurance company.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.560]   So you give the insurance company a lump sum of money,
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.960]   and it is now their money.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.780]   It's gone.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.960]   It's not like it's in an account
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.960]   that you can pull your money back out.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.440]   It's their money now.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.560]   But now they promise to pay you a fixed amount
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.960]   every month or quarter or year for as long as you are alive,
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.320]   or you can get a joint life annuity.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.960]   So it's as long as you and the other person are alive.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:50.140]   One important point about this is that since 2019,
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.380]   there are no longer any insurance companies
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.000]   that offer this type of lifetime annuity
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.820]   with a cost of living adjustment
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.380]   that's based on actual inflation.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.740]   So if you're buying this type of product,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.380]   you will be taking on inflation risk.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.660]   And that's another reason
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.060]   why people generally consider delaying social security
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.520]   to be the best option in this category
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.900]   is because social security benefits
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.560]   have an actual inflation adjustment.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.900]   So they don't have that sort of inflation risk.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.980]   And that's really all I've got
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.500]   on the cookie cutter retirement plan concept.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.900]   I hope you got something useful
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.600]   in terms of answering the other questions
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.480]   in retirement planning
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.680]   other than just when you can retire.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:40.520]   Do you wanna do some questions here or what's the plan?
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.540]   - All right, this is Chris.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.620]   So there are several questions that have been posted
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.500]   and Jeff and I have been reading them
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.860]   and we're trying to figure out exactly
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.060]   how to start addressing them.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.340]   I think the first question people are curious about
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.700]   'cause there was a lot of content
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.060]   is in what way will they be able to access this information
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.540]   after this call is over here?
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   - I gather that the event's being recorded.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.160]   I'm also happy to post the slides, of course.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.460]   - All right, that's great.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.800]   And then how will the slides be posted
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.180]   so people can access them?
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.620]   - I can post them on the forum,
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.020]   just as the PowerPoint so you can download them.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.140]   - Great.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:28.100]   - And for Minnesota Bogleheads at least
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.220]   we can send out a link to that link to my slides.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.660]   - Jeff, can you repeat that?
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:36.500]   What was that?
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.060]   - For the Minnesota Bogleheads we could,
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.180]   Diane is probably already planning on doing a follow-up
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.340]   with the link to the slides
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.420]   wherever you put them out there on your website
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.460]   or on the forum.
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.420]   - Okay, great.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.860]   - Thank you.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:53.140]   - If you don't mind, this is SS Critic.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.220]   I, first of all, wanna say hello to Mike.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.060]   - Hi.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.000]   - Communicating, we've never met.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:53:59.840]   - No.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.220]   - But we've been communicating about social security
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.480]   since before he wrote his first book.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.980]   - It's a pleasure, hi.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.820]   It's great to hear your voice.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.300]   - And I'd like to go back to the idea
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   that the low earner should file early.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:23.420]   That's under the assumption
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.180]   that the high earner is going to delay.
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:30.260]   If, for example, the high earner claims at 62
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.740]   and is thus getting a lower benefit.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.780]   And if the low earner waits until age 70
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.420]   and gets the delayed retirement credits,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.420]   the low earner can have a higher benefit
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.860]   than the high earner did.
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.260]   And that flips the thing all around,
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:50.260]   which means when the high earner dies,
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.260]   the low earner keeps getting her higher benefit
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.060]   or his higher benefit.
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.340]   And the reverse, so anyway,
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.920]   so the example Mike gave, which is correct,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.320]   is if you have minor children,
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.100]   the high earner has the minor children,
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.980]   may want to claim early.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.360]   And thus the argument basically flips on its head then.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.660]   - Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.900]   I was assuming that the two spouses
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.400]   are coordinating in their plan,
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.080]   but of course that might not be true.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.380]   The higher earner might've filed early,
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:29.280]   even if that wasn't wise to do so.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.440]   Or yeah, in the example that you gave with the minor child,
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.800]   it could very well make sense
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.080]   for that higher earner to file early
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.800]   so the child can get that child's benefits
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.680]   on that higher PIA.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   Yeah, and then the lower earner
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.520]   waits to increase their own retirement benefit
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.000]   and plausibly the survivor benefit.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.600]   - And of course it depends on their ages.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.320]   So if the higher earner is older,
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.880]   the higher earner is gonna hit 62 with that minor child
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.000]   years before the lower earner could hit 62.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.720]   - Yeah, definitely depends on ages
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.160]   and difference in primary insurance amounts too.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.400]   - Anyway, just nice to meet you, Mike.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.640]   Let somebody else take over. - Great to meet you too.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.920]   I've learned so much from you.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.740]   Thank you.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.680]   Thank you for being here.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.600]   I enjoyed it.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:19.960]   - Does anyone else wanna ask a question verbally?
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:26.840]   - Hi, Mike, great presentation.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:27.960]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.080]   - Yep. - Yes.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:29.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.020]   So awesome, I love your content, love your work.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.560]   I'd actually just post it on the chat,
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.920]   but I'll just ask you verbally.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.720]   I'm a high income guy, I'm a doctor.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.720]   I actually got into your stuff from the White Coat Investor.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.240]   I'm a high earner in a really like, I'm in New Jersey.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   So highest tax bracket, whites and docs.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.480]   I'm putting in a lot of in tax deferred,
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.200]   but then like, when is it in general,
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.040]   assuming it's similar tax rates,
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.680]   that I might have an RMD problem?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.840]   Really like maxed out tax deferred
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.760]   for the highest, you know, tax bracket.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.080]   But just in general, when should I say like,
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.400]   oh man, maybe I'm not gonna get that tax arbitrage anymore.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.640]   Maybe is it 5 million in tax deferred?
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.200]   I plan on retiring at 65
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.640]   and then taking Social Security at 70.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.360]   - So do you mean in terms of--
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.200]   - The tax arbitrage,
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.880]   like I'm gonna have an RMD problem, right?
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.360]   If my tax deferred is too high, right?
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.200]   We're like, oh my God,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.280]   I'm now at the highest tax bracket retirement
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.600]   based on the RMD.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.580]   I didn't get the tax arbitrage of tax deferral
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.080]   in my peak earning years now.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.280]   - And so are you asking whether it makes sense
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.760]   to be doing Roth conversions or Roth contributions
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.400]   instead of tax deferred contributions,
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.120]   or are you asking about just doing--
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.400]   - Yeah, 'cause that will say,
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.040]   oh, at this level of tax deferred,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.120]   when I retire at 65,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.480]   I really should do this amount of tax, right?
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.640]   Roth conversions between those, you know,
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.760]   between my Social Security claiming and the time I retire.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.720]   So that's gonna be a five-year window
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.840]   where it's just nice to know,
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.800]   oh my God, I'm gonna have an RMD problem.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.400]   I got to do Roth conversions at age 66, 67, 68, 69.
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:16.320]   So I don't know if you have a number just that's in general.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.880]   - I don't have a number because it's going to depend.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.080]   I mean, that's just not the way tax planning works.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:24.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.120]   - 'Cause it's going to depend entirely
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.520]   on what other things you have going on
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.960]   in your tax planning picture.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.600]   But so I would say if you have
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.720]   a Roth contribution option available to you,
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.320]   that could be definitely a point in favor
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.000]   of doing Roth contributions.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.800]   But if what we're talking about
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:49.640]   is just either doing tax deferred contributions
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   or just regular taxable saving,
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.520]   it almost always makes sense
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.360]   to be doing the tax deferred contributions,
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.200]   even if there isn't the tax arbitrage concept going on.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   Because with tax deferred accounts,
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.960]   again, at least they get to grow
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.640]   at their full rate of growth.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.760]   Whereas with the taxable account,
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.880]   you're paying tax every year.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.600]   So if you've got a Roth option
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.320]   and you are really, really got quite a bit in tax deferred,
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.840]   then absolutely doing Roth contributions
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.600]   definitely can make sense, even if you are a higher earner.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.000]   Another reason for that is that effectively with Roth,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.160]   you get to save more in a tax advantaged way.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.560]   Because with tax deferred,
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.760]   essentially the government owns a portion of that account.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.960]   If you were planning a 30% tax rate in retirement,
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.600]   you can think of a tax deferred account
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   as if it's a Roth account of which you only own 70%
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.960]   and the government owns the other 30%.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   And so basically your contribution limit every year,
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.280]   the government's getting to use a portion of it
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.600]   is kind of a way that you could think of it.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.480]   And so Roth effectively lets you save more
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.520]   in a tax advantaged way.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.320]   So even if you have a high tax rate,
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.960]   it can definitely make sense to do Roth contributions.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.520]   But if we're talking about
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.720]   just not doing tax deferred contributions
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.480]   and instead doing regular taxable saving,
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.560]   that can make sense, but it's pretty uncommon,
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.200]   especially the further away you are from retirement
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   such that the longer the period of time
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   that this money would be compounding,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.280]   then the more important it becomes
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.360]   to get all of the compounding
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.960]   rather than having a portion of it disappear
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.640]   to go to pay to taxes.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.360]   - Okay, cool.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.560]   Also a related question with just looking at state taxes.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.520]   I know there's no income tax states,
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.640]   but I think I guess maybe Tennessee and Vermont
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   might actually tax withdrawals from retirement.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.280]   Are there any other states that are like,
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.520]   well, wait, retirees should not retire here
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.840]   because even though there's low income tax or whatever,
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.960]   retirement income or drawing from those accounts
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.200]   are actually taxed and are actually much higher.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.560]   You know, any sort of state sort of tax bombs for retirees?
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.840]   I know it's sort of nuanced with every state, but.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.840]   - Yeah, I'm not honestly able to speak
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.080]   off the top of my head to the different state tax break,
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.880]   but definitely, certainly some states have no income tax,
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.720]   others have income tax, but it doesn't apply
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.560]   to social security or retirement account distributions.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.320]   And then some states have tax
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.120]   that applies to all of those things.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:49.480]   - We have another raised hand from Duncan.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.840]   Do you want you to ask your question
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.120]   and then we can maybe move on
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.800]   to open social security after this.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:05.080]   - It's in regard to the spending rules for retirement.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   And you mentioned the RMD rule.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.600]   And I'm wondering if what you think
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.080]   about using an endowment spending rule
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.280]   where you take a fixed percentage
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.680]   of using a smoothing process
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.280]   where you take a fixed percentage
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.760]   of the last seven years average value of your portfolio.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.360]   - Yeah, so I think of retirement spending strategies
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.000]   as basically existing on a spectrum.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.440]   And at one end of the spectrum
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.200]   is the pure percentage strategy
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.720]   where you say we're going to spend 3% every year.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.360]   And then at the other end of the spectrum
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.160]   is the 4% rule concept
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.240]   where despite having a percent in the name
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.560]   it doesn't actually fluctuate.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.000]   You're not letting the spending fluctuate
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.200]   based on the portfolio balance.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.120]   You're just spending the same dollar amount every year
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.640]   or inflation just a dollar amount.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   And so the further you are toward that end of the spectrum
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.520]   where you're spending the same dollar amount
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.240]   and you don't adjust based on portfolio performance
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.720]   the riskier it is because you're not cutting spending
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.160]   when the portfolio declines.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.760]   So the endowment strategy is kind of in the middle
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.320]   of those two extremes.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.760]   So it's riskier than a strategy
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.640]   that just says I'm going to spend 3% every year
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.600]   or 3.5% or 4% or whatever it is.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.960]   So it's riskier than that
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.920]   because you're not adjusting spending
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.960]   as much as that strategy would
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   but it's not as risky as the classic 4% rule.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.280]   So I think it's one of many very reasonable approaches
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.680]   I guess is what I would say.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:57.320]   - Okay, why don't we have,
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.360]   Mike, why don't you go on with your presentation?
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.920]   We'll take some more questions at the end, thanks.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.760]   - Sure.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.000]   Can you still see my screen share?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.720]   - Yeah, it's good.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.560]   - Great, okay.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.000]   So this is OpenSocial Security
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.600]   for those of you who haven't used it.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.480]   I gather many of you have.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.000]   - Excuse me, Mike, can I just,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.440]   I'm hearing like a clicking sound when you talk.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.840]   I wonder if you're, do you have a mic
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.080]   that could be hitting your desk or something?
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   - I am wearing earbuds.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.800]   Is it still clicking?
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.000]   - The mic is not connected to the earbuds.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.160]   I mean, the mic is, I mean, it's the earbuds mic.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.000]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.840]   - Maybe it was rubbing against my clothes or something.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.200]   - I think that's it, yeah.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.040]   - Okay.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   - Just make sure that's not happening.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.560]   - Yeah, I'm holding it now a little bit.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.160]   Is that better, hopefully?
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.000]   - Yes.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.840]   - Okay. - Thanks.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.120]   Oops.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.960]   Oops, sorry.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.800]   I just-- - Okay, great.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.640]   - Okay, good.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.320]   - So OpenSocial Security is hopefully
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.320]   pretty straightforward to use.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.120]   The base case here, it just takes your very basic inputs,
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.000]   marital status, gender, date of birth,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.360]   primary insurance amount.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.720]   And you can see, as we were talking about,
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.920]   a very basic scenario,
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.800]   a unmarried woman should file at age 70
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.600]   because it's slightly actuarially advantageous.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.440]   But we can start to come up
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.800]   with all sorts of other scenarios.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.840]   So for example, one we were talking about,
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.120]   this box at the top gives you additional options.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.080]   So if you say this person now has a child
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.920]   and one child and this child is disabled
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.720]   so they could get child benefits
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.160]   on this person's work record,
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.880]   now she should file as early as possible.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.560]   It basically just, it's a very case-by-case analysis.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.160]   And one change in the inputs
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.320]   can completely flip the output on its head.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.720]   And I know most of you have already been using this,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.680]   so I don't want to just show you
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.600]   a million different scenarios.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.240]   But one thing that I don't see used a lot on the forum,
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.120]   which I think is pretty useful, is this feature right here.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.440]   You can put in all of your inputs.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.480]   So let's say we've got one person born in 1958
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.400]   with a higher primary insurance amount.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.640]   And then if you want to,
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.560]   and obviously this isn't all that many inputs,
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.640]   but if you do the advanced options
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.040]   and then one person's still working
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.240]   and maybe there's a government pension
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.560]   and there's a whole bunch of input that you've put in,
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.960]   you can right-click right here and save that link.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.840]   And then you could just paste that in,
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.440]   I mean, either to another browser window later,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.800]   or you could post it on the forum.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.720]   And once the page loads,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.800]   it'll be pre-loaded with all of your inputs.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.560]   And that can be useful for if you want input
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.960]   on a particular, like if you want to talk on the forum
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960]   about a particular scenario,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.400]   you can put in all of your inputs,
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.240]   grab that link and then paste it into a forum post.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.200]   And then other people can look at it
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.600]   and see the exact scenario that you're talking about.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.280]   That's also useful if you work with a financial advisor,
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.840]   for instance, you could copy that link
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.800]   and then include it in an email.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.320]   So that's useful there.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.680]   I think that's mostly it that I wanted to show people
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.280]   is that you've got all the different options here.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.960]   So disability is obviously relevant.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.080]   Still working is where we've got
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.600]   the earnings tests coming into play.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.920]   Pension is for applying the windfall elimination provision
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.240]   and government pension offset rules.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.760]   You can use different mortality assumptions.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.480]   So the base case is we use
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.600]   the social securities period life table,
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.560]   but you can use other ones based on your health status,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.800]   or you can pick a particular,
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.240]   let's assume that I die at age 84.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.040]   You can put that in if you want to.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:09.160]   Children are relevant because child benefits are a big deal.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.080]   The discount rate,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.200]   this is basically what's the inflation adjusted return.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.080]   It's the take the money and invest that option.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   Or alternatively, if you delay social security,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.040]   you're basically spending down your portfolio
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:24.960]   at a faster rate.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.920]   So that means that some piece of your portfolio
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.760]   is no longer invested.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.280]   So you're giving up the returns
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.080]   on that piece of the portfolio.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.480]   So the discount rate is essentially reflecting that.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.760]   By default, it pulls in the yield on 20 year tips,
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.400]   but you can adjust it to be whatever you want.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.080]   You can also have this option to assume
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.360]   that benefits will be cut at some point in the future.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.440]   You can choose the year and the percentage.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.120]   So you can see how that changes the analysis.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.760]   And I think that's mostly it.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.920]   I know that most of you, frankly,
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.880]   have been using this for a while now.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.360]   And I see it all the time on the forum.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.560]   Anytime somebody asks about social security,
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.240]   people are coming in with the link to this calculator.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.920]   So if you guys have specific questions about it,
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.800]   I'm happy to answer them.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.040]   But I mostly just wanted to show you
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.360]   what the additional options are,
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.880]   'cause I think some people missed them.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.480]   And just this little link down here
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.960]   at the bottom of the page, it's really useful.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.920]   It saves you having to put in your inputs
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.080]   over and over and over.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.920]   - Hi, Mike.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.760]   This is Rick.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.840]   I did miss those options up top.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.120]   And I have a question about the still working option.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.440]   I assume that's for somebody who is old enough to retire,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.560]   old enough to collect social security at this point in time.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.400]   Or is there some way you can assume that in the future,
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   if I'm trying to plan, that I would still be working?
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.160]   Or how does that work in the context of the calculation?
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.320]   - So with the still working,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.760]   this is specifically with regard to the earnings test.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.120]   So the earnings test applies for people who are,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.240]   they've already filed for benefits
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.680]   and they're younger than full retirement age.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.840]   The earnings test can result in your benefit
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.440]   being either partially or completely withheld.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.600]   - Withheld, yeah, okay.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.120]   - And so this would account for that.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.760]   But if what you're wanting is,
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.680]   how would my primary insurance amount change
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.320]   based on additional years of earnings?
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.880]   This calculator won't account for that
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   just because by definition,
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.280]   it takes your primary insurance amount as an input.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.400]   So you have to tell it
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.240]   what your primary insurance amount is.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.720]   SSA.tools is another calculator made by another Fogelhead
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.120]   that could help you with that calculation though.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.880]   - Yeah, and I've actually the PIA amount
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.920]   for those of us that aren't quite to retirement age yet,
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.600]   that also assumes future years of earnings
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.880]   equal to or about the same
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   as what you're earning today, I think, right?
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.440]   So that if you were to quit working early,
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.640]   that number actually might be inflated a bit.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.440]   What you get from the social security statement itself.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.280]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.960]   The number on your social security statement
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.240]   is not actually your PIA.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.240]   That's the key point to know.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.800]   It's an estimate of what your PIA would be
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.240]   if you continue to earn the same amount
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.000]   that you've been earning until the age at which you file.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.720]   - Thank you.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.560]   - Sir.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:27.480]   - So at this point,
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.240]   I think we can have time for a lot of questions
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.120]   and answers from Mike.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.520]   We have a couple that have come in through the chat too,
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.920]   which we may want to address,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.760]   but I do see a hand that's raised at this point too.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.600]   Steve.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.200]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.120]   I have a question on delaying social security.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.560]   If I'm the high wage earner
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.080]   and I'm planning to delay benefits until age 70,
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.160]   and my spouse is the lower wage earner
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.920]   and she plans to collect hers as soon as she can,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.880]   let's say 62.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.360]   When I begin to collect mine at age 70,
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.480]   does her social security payment change?
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.920]   I think I was under the impression
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.160]   that hers changes to half of hers
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.080]   and that hers changes to half of mine at that point,
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.000]   but I might be wrong.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.320]   - So her benefit as your spouse,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.640]   if she's already receiving her retirement benefit
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.560]   at that point in time,
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.920]   then when you file for your retirement benefit,
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.080]   her benefit as your spouse would automatically kick in.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.960]   That's called a deemed filing.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.000]   And that benefit amount,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   it's only, it's not half of your benefit.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.160]   It's half of your primary insurance amount.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.240]   So it's half of what you would have gotten
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.760]   at your full retirement age.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.000]   So if you filed at 70,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.320]   you're getting more than your primary insurance amount
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.240]   and she would not be getting half of that.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.880]   She'd be getting half of your primary insurance amount.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.400]   So less than half of your benefit.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.360]   The other key point here is that if she's 62 at this time,
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.960]   or if she's younger than full retirement age,
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.840]   then her benefit as your spouse is going to be reduced
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.960]   because it will be beginning prior to full retirement age.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.800]   If you want to email me, I can, for example,
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.600]   give you some actual numbers using certain assumptions
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.280]   if you wanted to see how that would actually work out,
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.000]   but she would be getting less than your actual,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.520]   less than half of your benefit is the answer.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.040]   - Okay, thank you very much.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.880]   - Sure.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.160]   - I've got a quick one from the chat here.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.320]   Is there a difference between a divorced person
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.880]   and just a single person in terms of how you strategize?
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.000]   - There can be.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   So if you were married for at least 10 years
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.960]   prior to the divorce,
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.880]   then you basically would qualify for spousal benefits
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.480]   on your ex-spouse's record in the same way that you would
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.040]   if you were still married, roughly speaking.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.040]   So if you are the higher earner of you and your ex-spouse,
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.480]   then it doesn't really matter for your own planning
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.480]   unless you, for example, if you delayed taking your benefit,
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.960]   it would increase your ex-spouse's survivor benefit
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.600]   if they were to outlive you.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.000]   So if you're still on good terms
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.240]   and that's something you would want to do, then go for it.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.120]   But if you're the lower earner,
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.480]   then it really, really can change the analysis.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.160]   So for instance, I was just talking to someone
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.880]   the other day who is, I think she's 10 years,
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.120]   she's several years younger than her ex-spouse.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   So the ex-spouse is the higher earner and quite a bit older.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.400]   So for this person, it makes sense to file early,
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.720]   start her own benefit as early as possible
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.200]   because at some point, most likely,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.120]   she's going to start getting that survivor benefit
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.600]   on the ex-spouse's work record
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.720]   because the ex-spouse is a male and much older.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.080]   So it's likely that she's going to outlive him.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.360]   So she could start getting her own retirement benefit
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.720]   as early as possible
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.880]   and then start getting a survivor benefit
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.480]   on the ex-spouse's record if or when he dies.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.080]   (silence)
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:36.360]   There are also spousal benefits for exes.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   So that could come into play.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.880]   One thing that a lot of people aren't familiar with,
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.840]   you can file for a wife or husband's benefit as an ex
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.280]   if your ex has filed
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.480]   and if the divorce has been more than two years.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.680]   Oh, I said that backwards.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.000]   If your spouse has filed, your ex has filed.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.120]   However, if the divorce is more than two years,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.640]   then you don't have to wait for your ex to file.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.440]   You can still claim as a spouse against your ex,
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.040]   just like that.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.960]   That's called independently entitled.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.200]   - Good answer.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.360]   (silence)
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:28.400]   - I'll just add that that's especially relevant
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.640]   for anybody who's still able
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.040]   to do the restricted application option.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.480]   So anyone born before January 2nd, 1954,
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.000]   you could get a spousal benefit
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.360]   on your ex-spouse's work record
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.280]   while waiting for your own retirement benefit
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.640]   to max out at age 70.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.840]   (silence)
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.200]   - All right, here's another question that sometimes
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.800]   I don't know if you're gonna have the answer for it at all,
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.640]   but perhaps you have some insight.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.960]   Roth seemed like a great idea in a lot of ways,
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.760]   but is there any discussion going on regulatory wise
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.920]   that they may eventually be taxed
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.600]   or is that something we should not
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.080]   try to concern ourselves with?
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.560]   - Is that a thing I've heard proposed?
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.640]   Yes, but there's a million things proposed
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.680]   that never happen.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:25.280]   And then, I mean, among tax professionals who I know,
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.960]   I don't know anyone, frankly,
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.600]   who was anticipating the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.520]   We were expecting, you know,
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.560]   maybe the standard deduction will be dramatically increased
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:40.640]   and exemptions will go away
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.880]   and the itemized deduction for state income taxes
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.360]   will be limited to $10,000.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.240]   Like, I don't, people aren't very good
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.120]   at predicting legislative changes.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.520]   A thing we talk about on Bogleheads all the time
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.400]   is how hard it is to time the market, time the stock market.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.040]   And with the stock market,
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.240]   there's really only three things that can happen, right?
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.160]   It could go up, it could go down, or it could stay flat.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.920]   And even in that really simple case, it's hard to do.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.760]   With taxes, there's a million things that could happen.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.080]   Just with Roth IRAs, it's, might they become taxable?
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.960]   Might the rules for inherited Roth IRAs change?
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.480]   Might there be RNDs later?
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.440]   Might the contribution limit be increased
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.200]   to the 401(k) contribution limit?
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.040]   There's a million things that could change.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.320]   And then there's still the timing question.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.920]   So if we were assuming,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.040]   so just the case we're talking about,
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.120]   Roth IRA distributions becoming taxable.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.000]   Well, when does it happen?
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.280]   Does it happen five years from now, 25 years from now?
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.360]   If you get the idea right, but the timing wrong,
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.320]   it still doesn't help.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.800]   Just like if you predict a bear market,
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.720]   but you predict it five years in advance,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.480]   and so you miss five years of stock market run-up,
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.320]   it doesn't really help to have predicted the bear market.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   It's similar here.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.240]   You have to get the timing right,
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.080]   but you also have to get right what's even going to happen.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.880]   And then taking it a step further,
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.960]   there's, for a lot of things,
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.760]   there's the question of the numbers, right?
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.120]   If you're gonna, for example,
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.720]   one common thing that people talk about
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.080]   is the income thresholds
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.400]   for social security benefits being taxable.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.360]   Those were set in 1983,
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.760]   and they're not adjusted for inflation.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.880]   So they're still what they were in 1983.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.720]   So sometimes people talk,
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.680]   maybe those benefits or those thresholds will be increased,
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.120]   but what are we going to increase them to?
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   And so, unless you get the numbers right,
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:52.360]   your tax planning based on that prediction
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.480]   isn't going to be very useful.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.160]   So tax planning based on predictions
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.120]   about legislative changes, it's extremely hard.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.280]   It's much harder than timing the stock market,
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.760]   which is already, as we say on Vogelheads, not worth doing.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.400]   - And also just to comment,
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:14.520]   because it's kind of fruitless to talk about it,
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.680]   it's a prohibited subject on the forum.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.200]   So as far as upcoming legislation.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.200]   So I think that's probably one of the good reasons why.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.280]   - I agree, yeah.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.720]   - I think Lady Geek would say that's a good decision,
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.320]   and I agree.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.800]   Bharath, if you're unmuted, your hand is raised.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.920]   Do you have a question?
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:38.760]   - Yes, thanks, Mike, great info.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.360]   If you can drill down into the long-term care
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.600]   insurance option, or more broadly,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.360]   what you said was, look, if you have enough
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.400]   in your portfolio to handle your healthcare needs
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   during retirement, you may not need long-term care insurance.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.480]   And I'm wondering how to intelligently look at this topic.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.240]   I've not looked at the Vogelheads forum
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.760]   or anything like that yet.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.160]   So is there anything you could say to someone like me
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.840]   that's just beginning to explore this topic
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.800]   to understand how to approach healthcare in retirement
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.680]   and how much to save for it?
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.200]   - So are we talking healthcare or long-term care?
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:28.360]   - Yeah, like I think healthcare costs in general,
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.240]   and of which long-term care insurance is one strategy,
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.120]   right, to handle that?
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.520]   - Well, so long-term care insurance
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.120]   is specifically covering long-term care.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.840]   So care in a nursing home, for instance,
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.680]   or an assisted living facility.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.680]   Whereas healthcare, we're talking about medical procedures,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.200]   drugs, things like that.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.320]   So long-term care insurance is covering something different
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.280]   than what your health insurance covers.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.160]   - Okay, okay, yeah.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.480]   So I think in that case, yeah,
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.640]   let's just stick with the long-term care piece.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.480]   - Okay.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.280]   - And how to handle those costs during retirement.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.520]   - I think step one, a useful step is to look,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.560]   'cause it varies a lot geographically.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.360]   If you live in San Diego,
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   long-term care is going to cost more
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.720]   than if you live in rural Missouri.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:30.680]   So look at the facilities around you
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.160]   and see how much they actually do cost.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.720]   And that's gonna be step one.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.080]   Actual, just research where you live.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.600]   And then you can look at statistics
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.400]   on how long long-term care needs typically last.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.360]   But of course, you don't necessarily just want to plan
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.320]   on the typical length of stay,
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.600]   just like when you're retirement planning,
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.320]   you don't want to assume that you're going to die
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.480]   at your life expectancy, because you might live well
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.440]   beyond that, and then you need your savings
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.600]   to last longer than that.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.160]   So same thing with long-term care.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.160]   If you can afford the average length
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.080]   of a long-term care need, but no more than that,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.440]   well, then that still could be quite a problem.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.920]   But you can look at statistics
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.000]   about how long long-term care needs typically last,
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   and you can look at the actual prices where you live.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.680]   That's what I would do in terms of how to start
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.120]   to gauge whether it's something you could pay for
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.560]   out of pocket, or whether you might be wanting
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.840]   to look into insurance to cover that sort of cost.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:43.640]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.480]   - Sure.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:57.080]   - Mike, this is Diane.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.720]   There was a comment about if you could stop sharing
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.040]   your screen at this point.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.240]   I think people want to see some other faces.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.600]   And then I'm going to move to a very early question
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.880]   that came up, which had to do with what used
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.120]   to be called the stretch IRA.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.280]   And the question comes from Ben.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   Do heirs have to cash out both inherited traditional IRAs
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:29.000]   and Roth IRA within 10 years of receiving them as of 2020?
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.840]   - Hang on, sorry.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.680]   I'm still working on where do I no longer share my screen?
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.320]   This is, oh, back to meeting.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.400]   There we go, 'cause I was, come on.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.280]   - Yeah, I don't think I can stop it for you.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.600]   - Up at the top, there should be a button
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.720]   that says stop sharing.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.480]   - Oh yes, thank you.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.240]   It's of course on the monitor that I am sharing.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.240]   Thank you, Warren.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.600]   - Okay, all right, so Roth distributions for,
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.880]   what was the question exactly on inherited Roths?
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.680]   - Yeah, so what used to be the stretch IRA.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.040]   So it is, is there the 10 year payout rule
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.200]   for the traditional, in an inherited traditional IRA?
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.120]   Or is that just for the Roth IRA?
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:18.840]   - It's for both the way that the 10,
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.040]   so in certain cases, depending on who inherits the IRA,
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.880]   it might have to be distributed over a 10 year period now.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.000]   That applies for traditional IRAs as well.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.920]   - Stearns is trying to figure out how to raise his hand,
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.880]   but if you have a question, Stearns,
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   you could unmute and give it to Mike.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:45.520]   - Yeah, hi there, Jeff.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.760]   This down, I live down in Worthington,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.160]   not too far from South Dakota,
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.720]   which has no personal income tax.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:56.720]   And I'm wondering if it might be a wise strategy
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.920]   to move to South Dakota for a year or two
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.160]   and do some conversions there,
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.320]   and then move up to Minneapolis where the grandkids are
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.600]   and spend money like mad.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.400]   But given this low interest rate environment we're in,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.080]   and I'm probably two years away from retirement,
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.600]   and I claim social at 70,
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.600]   but yeah, the bulk of the assets are in the traditional IRA.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.360]   So, I mean, I'm looking at a pretty big tax bill
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.480]   from Minnesota and from the feds in the future.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.520]   So, I've got maybe two or three years
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.400]   before starting social security and there'd be no income.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.640]   We'd live off the brokerage account basically,
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.680]   which is already tax paid.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.600]   So, I would use those funds to live on
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.160]   and maybe pay income tax if we moved to South Dakota
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.680]   and started doing Roth conversions.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.800]   So, you may have heard this story before,
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.000]   but what do you think?
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.520]   - Yeah, I mean, obviously it depends
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.160]   on how willing you are to move,
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.720]   but it's not out of the question.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.680]   I would specifically look into
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.200]   the actual dollar amount of savings
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.800]   because of course moving itself
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.560]   involves a fair bit of financial costs
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   and a fair bit of work, but it's not out of the question.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.280]   People do certainly move for tax reasons.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.480]   - Okay, all right.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.720]   Yeah, we're only 50 miles away, so it's not a big deal.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.040]   We could rent over there and then buy a house up
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.040]   in the cities if need be, but thank you.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:22.020]   Now, I would note though that you would want to check
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.360]   to make sure that you're not still...
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:29.240]   So, if you still own your home,
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   if you were just renting and you don't...
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.200]   Just make sure that you're not accidentally
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.320]   still going to be paying state income tax.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.540]   - Sure, sure.
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.360]   And then as a risk adverse person,
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.640]   up in the late '60s with the Federal Reserve
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.480]   throwing us savers under the bus,
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.940]   there's probably not very many opportunities
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.040]   to get a decent rate of return
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.960]   that's pretty low risk at this point.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.800]   - Yeah.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.620]   - Unless we wait maybe 10 years
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.160]   for interest rates to go up again.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.960]   - Yeah, CDs are often...
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.720]   So, Alan Roth, spend much time on Vogelheads.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.560]   You're probably familiar with him.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.560]   Something he often suggests is looking at CD rates
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.040]   because in many cases, banks will offer CD rates
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.780]   that are quite a bit better than you could get on bonds,
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.800]   especially bonds of a similar credit quality,
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.840]   which would be treasury bonds,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.080]   assuming you're staying under the FDIC limit.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.380]   Another thing that a lot of people don't realize
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.280]   is that if you have a mortgage, you've got right there
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.040]   a risk-free rate of return available to you
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.460]   paying down that mortgage.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.160]   So, those are a couple of options,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.560]   but yes, absolutely, when interest rates are low,
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.680]   there aren't very high return options available
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.160]   in any safe way.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.560]   - All right, thank you, Mike.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:29:00.920]   - I don't see the raise a hand option, I'm sorry.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.040]   Can I step in?
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:03.920]   - Sure.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.920]   - Okay, referring to using the RMDs district option
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   as instead of 4% withdrawals,
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.120]   when I try this out on Portfolio Visualizer,
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.040]   the Monte Carlo simulation,
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:32.140]   all the RMD option always comes up
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:38.040]   with over 90% maximum withdrawal or something.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   I assume it has to do with exhausting the portfolio.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:49.560]   Is there a way to modify kind of play with this
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.480]   to see what else is there that can avoid
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.760]   looking at the 90% withdrawal?
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.640]   Thank you.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.960]   - Sure, so I'm not especially familiar
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.160]   with Portfolio Visualizer.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   I've used it a little bit,
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.480]   but I haven't done it enough to speak
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.880]   to all of the various options that it has.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:17.720]   But a lot of people do make adjustments to the RMD strategy.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:22.800]   So they keep that same age-based percentage concept,
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.400]   but you could spend a greater
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.420]   or smaller percentage every year,
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.040]   but still have something that's based on the idea
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:30.960]   that the older you are,
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   the greater the percentage that you could spend.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.000]   You could take the RMD percentage,
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.180]   multiply it by something greater than one
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:38.320]   or something less than one,
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.280]   depending on what change you wanna make.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.320]   And of course, again,
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.480]   the trade-off is exactly what you'd expect it to be.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.520]   The more you spend in early retirement,
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.840]   the more likely it is
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.840]   that you end up depleting the portfolio.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:56.520]   - Thank you.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.340]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.180]   Great. - Sure.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:02.480]   - I think there's another question that came in
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.840]   on the chat.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.320]   How would you factor in a pension
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:10.920]   in the timing of when to best claim Social Security benefits
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:14.040]   and which accounts you might spend first in retirement,
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.200]   Roth or Roth versus traditional when factoring a pension?
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.020]   - Sure.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.880]   With the pension,
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.920]   it's important to know whether it's a pension
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.560]   from non-covered employment,
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.500]   so a government pension.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:27.700]   So then we need to be thinking about
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.480]   the windfall elimination provision
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.080]   and government pension offset.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:38.480]   Also, important question is whether you have options
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.080]   and to what extent you have options
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.100]   in terms of when the pension begins,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:46.280]   because you might have an option to delay the pension.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:50.680]   And then you can have basically this case where,
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.520]   like we were talking about,
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.340]   where you have some window
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.520]   where your income is relatively low
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.920]   because you've retired and the pension hasn't kicked in yet,
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.440]   and maybe you're also delaying Social Security.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.960]   And then you can be doing some Roth conversions
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.040]   during those years.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.880]   But the analysis is still basically the same
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:11.000]   in terms of which accounts to spend from.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.400]   It's still about what's your marginal tax rate right now
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.240]   and how does that compare to the marginal tax rate
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.320]   you expect to have later?
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.120]   The point is just that the pension
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.360]   affects both of those questions, right?
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.040]   Because it's providing income
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.080]   and likely changing your tax rate.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.400]   But the analysis, it's still exactly the same concept.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.520]   It's how does my current marginal tax rate
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.480]   compare to my future marginal tax rate?
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:48.600]   - I have another question, Mike, from the chat,
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:52.560]   and this is a bit unfair because I didn't write down
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.540]   what slide you were on at the time this question came in.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:58.320]   So it may be out of context.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.440]   The question, so this was definitely,
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.680]   this is at 10 o'clock Central.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.160]   So this is definitely when you were on
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.520]   the first part of your talk.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.880]   And the question says, "Rising equity glide path
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.360]   "in lieu of RMD-based spending or both?"
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.760]   So I apologize, I cannot give you context.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.960]   If Tom Rowe is still on, he or she can pop on,
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.960]   that would be great.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.720]   (mouse clicking)
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:31.320]   - Okay.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.140]   - Okay.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:39.400]   Do we wanna go over?
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.440]   I know you had some of the questions
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.520]   that were submitted in advance.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.960]   We could, up to you.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:51.000]   - Yeah, why don't we go ahead and do that, Mike?
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.840]   - Sure.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.940]   - Do you want me to read them?
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:57.200]   - Sure, yeah, if you wanna go for it.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.120]   - So we had one question that says,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.560]   "I understand that Mike uses
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.040]   "the Vanguard Life Strategy Growth Fund.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.720]   "If he were to use a DIY portfolio,
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.460]   "would he have changed the asset allocation
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.840]   "stocks-bonds ratio over the last two years?"
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.800]   - I would not have changed that.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.000]   I would have eliminated the international bonds.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.640]   Definitely, no question about that,
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640]   but I wouldn't really have changed
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.300]   the stock-bond allocation at all.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.180]   - Okay, I think that you already addressed
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.320]   the 4% rule quite a bit,
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.380]   and so we'll skip over that one.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.220]   "What percentage of a portfolio
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.480]   "should be invested in real estate?"
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:41.280]   - If we're talking about, so REITs,
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:43.720]   so real estate stocks,
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.360]   I think a total market allocation makes perfect sense.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.960]   So that would be, I think,
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.220]   somewhere between 3% and 4%, basically.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.980]   There's no particular need to have an extra REIT holding
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.620]   to overweight that industry
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:00.980]   any more than you necessarily need a fund
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.300]   to overweight the financial services sector
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.300]   or any other particular sector.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:08.820]   If we're talking about how much of your net worth
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:11.860]   should be allocated to investment real estate,
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.080]   so a condo that you're gonna rent out or something,
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.880]   that's a tricky question to answer.
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.720]   Investment real estate is an undiversified asset
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.480]   as compared to an index fund,
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.000]   which is extremely diversified, right?
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.560]   When you buy a rental property,
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.160]   you have a lot of risk involved in this one property.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.240]   And then there's additional risk
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.360]   because generally with investment real estate,
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360]   it's a leveraged investment
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.680]   because you're borrowing a good chunk of the money
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.040]   used to make the investment.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.720]   So I think for a lot of people,
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.280]   the answer is zero, basically.
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.420]   You can own your own home
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.700]   and then there isn't really any need
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.840]   to do any individual investment real estate.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.460]   But for people who want to take on that risk,
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:01.340]   it's certainly has the potential for very high returns,
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.260]   but you should just recognize
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.980]   that it's an undiversified leveraged investment.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   So there's quite a bit of risk involved.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:11.840]   - Just to review, I think,
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:14.460]   and just make sure I understand,
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:18.960]   the total stock market index fund
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.600]   includes some like three to 4% of real estate.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.440]   - Right, exactly.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.640]   - So anything you buy, you're actually overweighting.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.640]   - Right, yes, that's precisely it.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.280]   And some people like to do that,
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.080]   but you can make a case
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.160]   for overweighting other industries as well,
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.000]   if you wanted to.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.360]   - One of the other questions that came in in advance
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.720]   is asked the following,
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.860]   what are your overall recommendations
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:48.660]   for an early retirement strategy?
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.100]   If details are helpful,
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.200]   assume a two worker household in their mid to late 40s
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.500]   with two children graduated from high school
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.200]   in about 10 years,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.260]   mortgage paid by children's graduation,
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:06.180]   retire at children's graduation at $100,000 a year,
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.180]   college funded via 529s or loans or other.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:15.120]   - So a very early retirement scenario,
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.120]   I think the things to primarily recommend
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.800]   are A, make sure you're using a really low spending rate
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.080]   because this portfolio might have to last
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   for a very long time.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.640]   And for the exact same reason,
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:30.680]   you probably want a pretty high stock allocation
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.400]   because that's what's most likely to sustain
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.840]   a given level of spending over a very long period of time.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.780]   As far as further details beyond that,
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.060]   like the tax planning details,
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.960]   we just need more information about the individual person.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:53.120]   Yeah, that's mostly all I can say is high stock allocation,
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.740]   very low initial spending rate.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:38:04.620]   - One of the other questions that came in
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.620]   is where at this time is the best place
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:09.200]   to put your money for five to 10 years investment?
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.820]   - Just like any other time we're talking about investing,
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.540]   it depends on risk tolerance, right?
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.300]   So is this, so if you say five to 10 years,
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:23.420]   well, is it money that you are going to be spending
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.060]   definitely on year five and on year six
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.220]   and in year seven and eight and just like that?
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:31.060]   Or is it maybe you're gonna be spending it in year five,
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:33.460]   but if things don't go well,
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:35.380]   you're fine spending it in year 10?
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.980]   So it depends on that.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:40.540]   It also depends on is this money
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:43.140]   that absolutely needs to be there at the time,
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.360]   or is it something where you'd be okay
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.500]   with spending somewhat less because you took a risk
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.600]   and it didn't pan out?
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.600]   So it depends entirely on risk tolerance.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.900]   I think stocks are clearly very risky
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.960]   over periods of less than 10 years.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.760]   So you could use a modest stock allocation.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.120]   So 20% stocks, 80% bonds, that's not insane,
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.240]   but I think it also makes perfect sense
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.000]   just to buy a seven-year CD for money
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.200]   that you're spending in seven years.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.840]   So it depends entirely on what the actual goal
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:19.920]   in question is.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:28.320]   - So we have about 10 more minutes of Mike's time,
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.840]   and I wanna make sure that we can try
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.100]   to get a couple more questions in here.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.160]   I know that some of you may need to leave,
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.400]   and I just hope that you've gotten as much
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.460]   as we have gotten out of Mike's great presentation.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:43.240]   There was a question that came in
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.760]   on the pros and cons of international bonds.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.560]   - Sure.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   The pros, in theory,
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.320]   is that it provides a diversification benefit
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.960]   because the things that affect interest rates
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.840]   in other countries are not the same things
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.100]   that affect them here.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:06.560]   Specifically right now, the cons are,
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.920]   if you compare Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:13.260]   to the domestic version,
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.360]   you'll see that it has a significantly lower yield
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.300]   and significantly more risk.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.360]   So it's not looked as a stand,
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.100]   if you look at it as a standalone investment,
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:27.000]   it doesn't exactly look like a winner.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.280]   But in theory, it can provide some diversification benefit.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.440]   One of the reasons I don't find that argument
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.680]   to be especially compelling
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.760]   is that you don't really need diversification
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:43.640]   in the fixed income part of your portfolio
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.380]   because there's always CDs and treasury bonds.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:50.960]   You can put it all in one type of thing,
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.840]   whereas with the stock portion of your portfolio,
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.840]   you need to diversify.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.320]   You don't want it all in one stock.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.480]   That'd be insane.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.240]   But with the bond portion of the portfolio,
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.600]   you can use just CDs and that's not diversified,
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.720]   but it's not as if it's risky
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.520]   because you've got FDIC insurance.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.900]   So in theory, there is a diversification benefit,
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.200]   but right now international bonds have lower yield
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.040]   for higher risk, which doesn't seem very appealing to me.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.260]   - What percentage of international stocks
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:25.360]   do you recommend in a balanced portfolio?
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.120]   - I think the starting point for analysis
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.000]   should just be the market capitalization,
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.080]   the market weighting.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.640]   So what you would see from the Vanguard Total World ETF
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.900]   or Vanguard Total World Index Fund.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:43.840]   And that weighting of course varies over time
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.640]   because sometimes the US market does better,
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.760]   which means that after that happens,
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.260]   a greater portion of that allocation would be domestic.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.460]   But then I think you wanna make adjustments from there.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.920]   And for most people, what you'll find
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.800]   is that you generally should end up skewing towards domestic
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.400]   because the primary reason is that living here in the US,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.200]   we generally spend in dollars.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.160]   And so that means that international funds
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.560]   have an additional source of risk, which is currency risk.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:21.480]   It's basically risk that the performance is affected
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   because the currency in which those other investments
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.800]   are denominated decreases in value relative to the dollar.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.920]   So once you account for that,
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.440]   you basically generally want to skew
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.280]   somewhat towards a US allocation.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.320]   And that's especially true for retirees.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.760]   So basically once you're actually spending
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.720]   from your portfolio, that becomes more relevant.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.800]   So you'll often see anywhere from 20 to 40% recommended,
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.640]   but it varies depending on what the best is,
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.440]   it varies depending on what historical period
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.560]   you look at and so on.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:00.480]   - I've got a question.
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:05.520]   You've talked about CDs and treasury bonds.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.720]   One of the things I learned
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.160]   from the Bogleheads Forum about,
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.240]   initially were I bonds and then also EE bonds.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.880]   Could you comment on those two options
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:18.520]   to fill that portion of the portfolio
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.080]   that you showed to pay for spending early on in retirement?
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.920]   In fact, if you would show that graph again,
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.440]   I don't know if you could do that,
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.880]   but that was one of my favorite slides.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.880]   - Okay, so just on the topic of other bond options,
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.680]   I bonds, yeah, they do often get left out
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.760]   and I'm as guilty as anyone.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760]   I didn't even mention them today,
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.280]   but they're very useful because like tips,
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.840]   they're providing an inflation adjusted return,
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.920]   but they don't have market risk like tips do.
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:58.800]   It's either you have to buy them through treasury direct,
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.760]   which some people don't like, or you can up to a limit.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.160]   Harry said the finance buff, he wrote about this recently.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.200]   You can intentionally overpay,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:11.720]   overpay your estimated taxes
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.720]   or have a little bit too much withheld on purpose.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.840]   And then basically one of the ways
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.160]   you can get your refund for the year
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   is have them automatically purchase I bonds for you.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:26.040]   Also another advantage of any type of treasury bond
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.920]   is that it's exempt from state income tax.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.400]   So if you are looking at savings
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.760]   outside of retirement accounts,
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.160]   that's an additional advantage there as well.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.560]   And on, so if you wanna see,
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.160]   I'm looking at sharing my screen again,
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.080]   if you wanted to see that slide again.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:49.200]   Let's talk to.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:45:07.800]   But do you have a specific question about the,
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.200]   I assume we're talking about this slide, this idea,
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.240]   like that concept.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:20.960]   - Chris, you're muted.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.480]   - Sorry about that.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:27.000]   Yeah, just to comment on EE bonds and I bonds
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]   and if they could fill one of those slots.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.760]   - Sure, absolutely.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.760]   So the space here, basically the, any of the individual,
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.440]   we're going to spend this money
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.840]   over this predetermined period of time.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:43.320]   Absolutely, other types of treasury bonds
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.400]   can be a great fit for that.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:51.600]   I would say, especially for the longer windows
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.480]   because with I bonds,
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.720]   so one of the advantages is the inflation protection.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:58.280]   Of course, inflation protection over two years
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.720]   is less of a big deal than inflation protection
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.320]   over an extended period.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.200]   So I bonds can be an even better fit
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.800]   for that dedicated spending over an extended period.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.200]   It's a great way to reduce the inflation risk
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.520]   that you're facing there
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.960]   because that's basically the only risk you have with,
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.280]   if you're using FDIC insured CDs,
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.600]   you know that the money is going to be there.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.040]   The only risk that you have is pretty much inflation
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.960]   and I bonds are a great way to alleviate even that risk.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:37.560]   - So the question came in on this slide.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.480]   What are, oops, now we lost the slide.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.240]   What are strategies- - Oh, sorry.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.080]   - It's okay.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.680]   What are strategies to address planning
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:51.680]   for possible late retirement balloon of financial need
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.960]   regarding assisted living, increased healthcare needs,
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.160]   et cetera, not covered by insurance?
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.960]   - Yeah.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.960]   One thing that kind of coincidentally works out well
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:11.880]   is when we were talking about spending rates,
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.640]   we were saying that you need to use
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.560]   a low initial spending rate
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.520]   because you don't know whether stocks
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.920]   are going to provide good returns.
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:25.560]   But what usually happens is stocks do provide good returns.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.400]   And so if you're using
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.200]   a very conservative initial spending rate,
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.000]   what actually you see is most,
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.800]   a lot of people see their portfolios grow
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.960]   throughout retirement, even though they're spending from it.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.760]   And so that can actually all by itself
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.160]   really significantly alleviate that problem
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.160]   of healthcare costs going up significantly
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.000]   later in retirement or long-term care needs or so on.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.800]   But then of course, you do obviously
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.880]   want to have health insurance, no doubt about that.
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.400]   Long-term care insurance, you might want to have it.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.440]   Again, it's more useful if you're married
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.120]   than for a single person.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.320]   And there's again, the hybrid options to consider,
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.240]   annuities or life insurance policies
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.680]   with long-term care writers.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:16.040]   - That's great.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.360]   So there are questions that are still coming in.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:22.000]   So I want to just kind of pause here.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.800]   First of all, Mike,
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.560]   if somebody does want to reach you through email,
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.960]   what is the best email that they should use for that please?
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.520]   - Mike@obliviousinvestor.com.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.180]   (upbeat music)
