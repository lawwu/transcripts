[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.440]   - Why does God hide himself from believers?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   It's a question we have touched on on the podcast,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.900]   but we need to address it head on.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.640]   We do so today through a question sent to us
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.340]   from James, a listener in Toledo, Ohio.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.120]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.000]   Way back in APJ 338, you said,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.800]   "God sometimes chooses to withdraw from us
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.800]   "his manifest, experienced, known, tasted,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.680]   "sweetness of his presence."
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280]   But you also said that God never leaves
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.460]   or forsakes his people either.
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.720]   So God never forsakes his people,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   but he sometimes withdraws from them
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   the sweetness of communion with him.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.140]   He hides his face, as the psalmist says,
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.760]   in about a dozen places.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.960]   In that episode, you demonstrated conclusively
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.160]   why this dynamic is equally at work
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.960]   in the old covenant and the new covenant alike.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.140]   At the end of it, you said God has, quote,
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.080]   "His reasons for doing this," end quote,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200]   but that, quote, "Maybe there would be another time
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.000]   "for us to talk about that," end quote.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.920]   That was eight years ago.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.000]   I don't know that you have addressed it since.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720]   Can you now explain some of the reasons
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.200]   why God would intentionally hide his face from us?
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.600]   - So important.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   Let me repeat the very, very crucial,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.840]   central statement that he made.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.200]   He said this.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.720]   So God never forsakes his people,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.600]   but he sometimes withdraws from them
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.340]   the sweetness of communion with him.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.680]   He hides his face, as the psalmist says,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320]   in about a dozen places.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   And his question is, why would God do that
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120]   to his own children?
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.320]   But first, let me make the case that he already accepts.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   He doesn't need me to make the case,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.400]   but my guess is some of our listeners are saying, "Really?"
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.320]   - Yeah.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.680]   - There is evidence in our very songs
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.280]   that we sing these days
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   that there's disagreement about this.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.000]   For example, Edward Mote wrote this great hymn
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.400]   that most of us would recognize 150 years ago.

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.280]   Okay, that's what he wrote.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.400]   When darkness veils his lovely face.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   Then about a decade ago, a group, I won't name them,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.600]   adapted this hymn, and we sing it now,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.440]   I think under the title Cornerstone,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   and it goes like this.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.880]   ♪ My hope is built on nothing less ♪
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   ♪ Than Jesus' blood and righteousness ♪

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.140]   So Edward Mote, who wrote the hymn,
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   wrote when darkness veils, really veils, his lovely face,
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.000]   and the group thought they could improve on that
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.720]   and do better, and they say, no, actually,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.480]   we're gonna sing when darkness seems to hide his face,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420]   as if it doesn't really happen.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.200]   Well, there's disagreement.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   (both laughing)
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.920]   That's the least you can say.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   There's disagreement about that.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.320]   And why would that be?
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.380]   My guess is that those who think darkness
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.600]   really doesn't hide his face,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.360]   but only seems to hide his face,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.880]   would probably also reject William Cooper's verse
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.360]   in his great hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way,"
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.960]   one of my favorite hymns.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.620]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.700]   ♪ Judge not the Lord by feeble sense ♪
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.240]   ♪ But trust him for his grace ♪
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   Behind a frowning providence, he hides a smiling face.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.640]   Now, Cooper not only says that darkness hides God's face,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.840]   but that God hides God's face.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   Behind a frowning providence, he, God, hides a smiling face,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   which is what the question is.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   Why would God do that?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   And I think Cooper's understanding is right
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.440]   in the way God relates to his people.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   God is never wrathful toward his forgiven,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.800]   justified, redeemed, loved, secure children.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   Christ has absorbed all of God's wrath,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.260]   and we have passed out of death into life.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.520]   We have moved beyond judgment
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   because the death of Christ is our condemnation.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.600]   We don't bear it anymore.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.720]   We have been transferred into the kingdom
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.080]   of his beloved son.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   Therefore, God delights in us
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.840]   as his justified, forgiven children.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   But that delight does not exclude disapproval
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.520]   of behaviors and attitudes
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.380]   which don't reflect the glory of the Father
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.840]   in his children,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.460]   and it doesn't exclude discipline of his children.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.720]   So the Proverbs says, this is Proverbs 3:12,
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   "The Lord reproves him whom he loves as a father,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.180]   the son in whom he delights."
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.720]   That's amazing.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   We reprove the very son in whom we delight,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.220]   and in the New Testament, Hebrews,
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.860]   the book of Hebrews quotes that very proverb
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.780]   in reference to the suffering of Christians and says,
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.960]   "Have you forgotten the exhortation
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.420]   that addresses you as sons?
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.060]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.560]   nor be weary when reproved by him,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.660]   for the Lord disciplines the one he loves
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.040]   and chastises every son whom he receives."
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   And that discipline sometimes includes seasons
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.380]   of spiritual darkness when God turns his face away.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.860]   For example, turns his face away from answering our prayer.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.860]   Like James 4:3, "You ask and do not receive
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.780]   because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions."
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.180]   In other words, I'm looking away from that prayer.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.780]   Your attitude and your motives are so corrupt.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.780]   I'm looking away from that sinful request.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.020]   And that may feel like darkness.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.280]   That may feel like a season of darkness
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.420]   'cause it is when his face turns away, there's a cloud.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   So let me give three reasons why God may turn his face away
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.940]   from time to time and give us over to seasons of perplexity,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.800]   confusion, darkness, number one.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.060]   He does it to teach us the value of his precious presence
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.340]   by withdrawing it for a season.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.300]   Ephesians 1:18, Paul prays for the Ephesians
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.140]   that the eyes of their hearts
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.880]   would be enlightened to know God.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.380]   He's praying for Christians.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.220]   He's praying for Christians because the brightness
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.220]   and the light of God's preciousness is not always as clear
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.940]   as it should be or as we want it to be.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.940]   So he asks that we would know God as we ought to know God.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.760]   Know the sight of his face as we ought to know the sight
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.000]   with the eyes of the heart of his face.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.140]   And fresh glimpses of the worth and beauty
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.180]   and greatness of God would be given to us
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.900]   and that we would cherish him more
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.780]   because of having lost sight for a season.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.060]   That's number one.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.620]   Number two, to teach us our own weakness
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.580]   in holding fast to Christ
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.900]   and keeping a clear view of his face,
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.220]   our weakness to keep a clear view of his face
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.900]   so that we are humbled and made to realize
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.060]   how utterly dependent we are on God
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.340]   to keep his face before our heart's eyes.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.480]   That's why Paul's praying.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.380]   It's God's doing.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.220]   At the end of the book of Jude,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.740]   he only has one chapter, verses 24 and 25,
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.980]   he soars, Jude soars
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.640]   with the most beautiful doxology in the Bible.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.140]   And all of it is because of how amazed he is
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.500]   that God and God alone can keep us from stumbling
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   and present us before God's face, God's glorious face.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.960]   So I think from time to time,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.980]   he allows us to slip into darkness
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.540]   so that we realize how desperately dependent we are
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.020]   for seeing him on his grace,
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.420]   which Jude so powerfully celebrates.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.380]   And then finally, number three,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.300]   I think he does this to remind us
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.300]   what it was like to be lost without Christ.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.220]   In Ephesians 2.12, Paul commands us,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.220]   "Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ."
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:09.420]   He never wants us to forget what a wonder it is
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.900]   that God has revealed his beautiful face to us,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.780]   removed separation, stepped in, lifted the veil,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.420]   made his face bright to us in the gospel.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.180]   So from time to time,
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.860]   he allows us to taste that former darkness
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.800]   so that we will come trembling back to the word
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.540]   and prayer and the cross and lay hold on God in a fresh way
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.860]   and love our salvation more than ever.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.600]   So my prayer for all of you,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.700]   all our friends who listen to these programs
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.820]   is that when you walk through such a season,
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.240]   you would do what Isaiah 50.10 says,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.500]   "Let him who walks in darkness and has no light
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.460]   trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God."
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.340]   Because as Hosea 6.3 says,
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.140]   "His going out is sure as the dawn.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   He will come to us as the showers,
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.300]   as the spring rains that water the earth."
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.140]   - So good.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.620]   Isaiah is super helpful and important here.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.940]   I'd also throw into the mix Isaiah 8.17, which reads,
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.100]   "I will wait for the Lord who is hiding his face."
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.100]   And then he says in him, "I will hope."
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.900]   The God who hides himself from us
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.340]   is the same God we hope in.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.300]   We've got to get that right.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.140]   It's important.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.300]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.980]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.100]   search our growing archive,
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.440]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.580]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.820]   One of the themes we address on the podcast is retirement
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.820]   and how to not waste it.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.060]   We've talked about end of life decisions too,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.460]   but we've spent very little time talking about
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.180]   inheritances and wills and things like that.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.740]   We will do so next time.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.900]   I'm your host Tony Reinke,
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.340]   and we'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.380]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
