[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.440]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the seventh chapter, verse 20 to verse 29.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.840]   Now, in particular tonight, I'm anxious to deal with the last portion of those verses
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.040]   that I've just read to you.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.000]   We are told that Moses supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320]   hand would deliver them, but they understood not.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.840]   one again, saying, Sirs, you are brethren; why do we wrong one to another?
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.040]   But he that did his neighbor wrong thrushed him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040]   a judge over us?
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.440]   Will thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.080]   Then fled Moses at this saying, and there was a stranger in the land of Midian where
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.560]   he begat two sons.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.760]   Those who attend here regularly will know that we've been considering the message of
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.080]   this great seventh chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles for many Sunday nights
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.520]   indeed ever since the beginning of last October.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.800]   And we are spending our time with it in this way because it is such an important and such
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080]   a crucial statement.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   What we have recorded in this chapter is a speech, an address, that was delivered by
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.440]   a man called Stephen, who was the first Christian martyr.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   Stephen had been arrested, and we see him standing before the great high court at Jerusalem
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.320]   that was called the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.280]   The Sanhedrin, as you remember, consisted of a number of notable people.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.040]   It consisted, as we are told, in the fourth chapter of the priests and the captain of
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.120]   the temple and the Sadducees, and in addition to those, there were certain of the rulers
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.840]   and elders and scribes.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.600]   It was a most religious gathering of people.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.400]   The religious leaders were all members of the Sanhedrin, Pharisees and scribes on the
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   one hand, and the priests, the Sadducees, on the other.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   And these politicians, the Herodians and others.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.240]   Now that was the constitution of this great council.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.680]   And they have arrested Stephen, and they have put him on trial.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   Why?
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   Well, they are charging him with blasphemy.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.920]   Why were they charging him with blasphemy?
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.160]   The answer was, because to them he was preaching a new message, which they regarded as being
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   blasphemous.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.920]   They said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.400]   But the real trouble was this.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.080]   We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and shall change the
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.920]   customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.840]   In other words, Stephen is on trial, because he is a Christian, because he was preaching
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.920]   the Christian message, because he, like the apostles, was preaching that Jesus of Nazareth
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.760]   was the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.280]   Peter had put it in very explicit terms when he put it in this language.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.920]   He said, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.240]   him given among men whereby we must be saved."
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.520]   Their claim was that this was the Son of God, and that he had come into the world to provide
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.560]   a salvation for men, and that he had done so.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.880]   That it was a full salvation, a complete salvation.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   He didn't need any help, he didn't need any assistance, he didn't need any honors, he
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.660]   didn't need any supplement.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.080]   Salvation was to be found in Jesus Christ alone.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.120]   And they called men and women to repent and to believe in him.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.440]   You remember how Peter began to do this, indeed, on the day of Pentecost.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.560]   He was preaching about this Jesus, and as he was doing so, we read that when they heard
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.120]   this they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.160]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.760]   Then Peter said unto them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   That's it.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.560]   All they had to do was to believe, to repent, and to cast themselves upon this Jesus, and
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   immediately they would be saved, and would receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.000]   Now that's what Stephen had been saying, as they were all saying, and it is because of
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.720]   that he's on trial.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.200]   And so we read in the first verse, "Then said the high priest unto him, 'Are these things
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   so?'"
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.440]   And what follows is the account of Stephen's defense, Stephen's statement of his case as
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.680]   over and against the members of the Sanhedrin, and we've been examining it at great length
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.200]   and in great detail.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I've told you that what he's done, what Stephen does, is to review the history of
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.120]   these people in order to show that they've completely misunderstood it.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.840]   They were very proud of Abraham, and then he shows them how this very Abraham of whom
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.200]   they're so proud, prophesied the coming of this Jesus.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   It's no use.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   They're saying that they're Abraham's seed and Abraham's children.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.440]   They're denying the very thing that their great forefather believed.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.360]   They're rejecting this thing that he looked forward to.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.920]   Then he takes up, secondly, the case of Joseph.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.960]   He shows that Joseph is a kind of type of Jesus Christ, that the way in which Joseph's
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.720]   brethren treated Joseph is just a prefiguring of the way in which they, the Sanhedrin and
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   the Jews, have dealt with the Messiah when he came.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.280]   And then he comes to this third case, which we've been considering since the beginning
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.560]   of this year, the case of Moses.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.880]   And this, of course, is another crucial one, because he was the great lawgiver.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.640]   It was through him that God had given the law to the people.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.800]   So one of the charges brought against Stephen is that he is denying the teaching of Moses
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.080]   and trying to do away with it.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.640]   And so Stephen sets out to show them that far from doing that, he's doing the exact
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   opposite, that Moses again had prefigured the coming of this Son of God, this great
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.120]   Messiah, had said specifically that God will raise up out of your midst another prophet
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   like unto me.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   Him shall he hear.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.680]   And that, said Stephen, is this Jesus whom you are rejecting.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   Very well.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   Now that's the essence of the case as put forward by Stephen.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.780]   And we are studying it, of course, because of the great lesson it's got to teach us.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   These things don't change.
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.360]   Men and women are still doing the same thing.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.560]   The world in the main is not Christian.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.480]   The world is rejecting this Savior of the world, this Son of God, exactly as the members
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.000]   of the Sanhedrin did.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.440]   So what Stephen said to them is of very great and vital practical importance to us.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   Now we've seen many things already, but what I'm dealing with at the moment is this.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.840]   We see in the case of Moses something that happens to all of us.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.840]   God confronts everybody who comes into this world with a great choice.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   You remember in the case of Moses it was this.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   He'd been brought up, as we are reminded by the story, as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.200]   He had marvelous chances and opportunities.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   He was a clever man.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.880]   He was learned in all the wisdom and the law of Egypt.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.520]   He was a mighty man in words and in deeds.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.860]   There were these great prospects as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.440]   But the call of God came to him.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.080]   When he was full forty years old it came into his heart.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.280]   God began to deal with him and to speak to him and to call him to something, out of where
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.680]   he was to this mission that God had got for him to deliver his people.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.800]   And here he is confronted by this tremendous choice.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.480]   Which is it going to be?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.000]   The Pole of Egypt, the Pole of the people of God.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.760]   Well, we saw a fortnight ago that Moses made the right choice.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.880]   He chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.640]   of sin for a season.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   And we considered the reasons which are indicated here as to why he did so.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.800]   But alas, that's not the whole story.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.160]   This same record as given by Stephen, and this is the point of course that Stephen is
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.000]   most anxious to make, tells us that the majority of the children of Israel, when confronted
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.200]   by the same choice, did the exact opposite of Moses.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.520]   Moses is sent to them to deliver them.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   Here is the opportunity of deliverance.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.640]   They rejected it.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.200]   They refused it.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.240]   This pathetic twenty-fifth verse we were considering last Sunday night.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:23.000]   He supposed that his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.280]   But they understood not.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.840]   Oh, here's the tragedy.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   Men and women rejecting the offered salvation.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.000]   They did it in the days of Moses.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.320]   You are doing it now, says Stephen, to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.680]   And I'm in this pulpit tonight and calling your attention to this because men and women
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.440]   are still doing exactly the same thing.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.520]   Have you rejected him, my friend?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.040]   Have you refused him?
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.120]   Rejects one or the other, you either accept him or else you refuse him.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   And if you don't accept him, you are refusing him.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.680]   Now, what is the explanation of this tragedy?
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040]   This is the greatest of all tragedies.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   Look at our world tonight.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   Look at its trouble.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:16.000]   Look at its agony, its pain, its turmoil, its torment.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.600]   And yet, it's refusing this offer of God that can deliver it out of it.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.040]   This is the essence of the human tragedy.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.280]   Why is it that mankind behaves like this?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.240]   Now, that's what we are dealing with.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.520]   Last Sunday night we saw that the first thing was this, that it's due to the failure to
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.080]   think correctly and straightly.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.480]   He thought they'd understand, but they didn't understand.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.520]   What causes this?
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.840]   What is it that makes mankind in its need and pain refuse and reject such an offer?
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.880]   Well, the whole case of the Bible is just to say this.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.240]   It is due to what the Bible calls sin.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.840]   Nothing less than that.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   What is sin?
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.720]   Ah, well, there are many today who would say that sin, yes, it does affect us, but it's
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.680]   nothing very serious and nothing very profound.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.240]   There are those who even say that sin is some kind of negation, not something positive,
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.120]   just the absence of qualities.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.440]   But oh, that's not the teaching here, and it's not what mankind is showing and manifesting.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.360]   Sin is a terrible power.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.160]   It's a mighty power.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:35.320]   It's so powerful that it affects the whole of our being and vitiates our greatest powers.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:42.640]   Sin is this terrible influence that leads us all astray and causes us to be guilty of
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:51.200]   this indescribable folly of rejecting the only Savior and his great salvation.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.920]   And we saw that the first thing that sin does is to paralyze the mind.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   Man doesn't think straightly.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.640]   He thinks he does, boasts of it even, but he doesn't.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.800]   The whole trouble with the world is that it refuses to think in the only way that is truly
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   rational.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.360]   But now I want to show you this evening that there is a second thing that sin does, and
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.880]   this is, if anything, even worse.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.220]   It not only affects the mind of men, but it also affects his heart.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.800]   It affects his whole spirit.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.360]   This I say is even worse because it shows that there is a perversion at the very center
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.920]   of man's being as he is by nature.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:48.880]   There is a rottenness down in the very most fundamental part of his being.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.600]   And this is the thing that comes out here so plainly and so clearly.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.560]   In the lost analysis, of course, it is this that accounts for the fact that man's thinking
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   has gone astray.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.280]   Why is man's thinking wrong as we saw last Sunday?
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.640]   Well, the answer is that man is governed by what is called prejudice.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.560]   And prejudice is stronger than the power of reason.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.480]   Now, we all know that.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   Every one of us knows what it is to be prejudiced.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.640]   We've all been guilty of terrible prejudices.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.000]   And prejudice, you see, is something deeper than reason.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.080]   It's lower than reason, and it's more fundamental than reason, and it controls reason.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.600]   Prejudice is that, as the very word tells us, which prejudges the issue.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.440]   It doesn't wait to listen to it.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.360]   It arrives at its verdict before it's heard the evidence.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.720]   That is what we mean by prejudice, isn't it?
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.760]   The prejudiced person is a power and I won't think.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.680]   Now, we're all, I say, we're all guilty of prejudice.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.760]   Every single one of us.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.600]   This is not confined to some people.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   It's something that is characteristic of the whole of the human race because of sin.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.520]   Something makes us take up an attitude and then we find reasons to support it.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   We haven't arrived at our position by a calm process of reasoning, not at all.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.040]   Well, think of the obvious examples.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:19.160]   Racial prejudices, color prejudice today, national prejudices, class prejudices.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.080]   The world is full of prejudices, and that is why the world is in such a muddle.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.080]   You see, don't just sit down and think of their positions, not at all.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.920]   They start in a position and then they defend it and attack the other.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.080]   They've never even considered their position or the other.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.000]   They just start shouting at one another, confirming the prejudice, downing the other one.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.520]   I'm right because I am what I am.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.080]   My color, my country, right or wrong, prejudice.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   Refusal to think.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.040]   Now, that, you see, is something irrational.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.600]   That's not based upon brain and reason and understanding.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.520]   That is to be governed by something more elemental.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.400]   This is more emotional, isn't it?
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.960]   Prejudice is always emotional.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.960]   That's its level.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.800]   But it's so powerful that it governs the thinking.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.360]   It controls the thinking.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.880]   That is why there is so much argument and disputation.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:23.000]   But, and this is the terrible thing, that is why there is so much bitterness, so much
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.240]   harsh feeling, and in consequence, so much unhappiness.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.680]   Now, that's the thing I want to show you this evening as it's depicted here in this old
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   story.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   This that happened to Moses.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Now, look at this.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.800]   Isn't there something almost incredible about it?
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.280]   Moses has come to deliver these people.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:50.720]   But this is the treatment he gets when he tries to prevent these two Jews, these two
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.440]   children of Israel, quarreling and fighting one another and getting at one another's
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   throats.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.600]   The man who was doing the wrong to the other thrust him away saying, "Who made thee a
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.480]   ruler and a judge over us?
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.160]   You come, ye sister, kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.360]   I'm going to let this thing be known about you."
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.320]   So Moses, in terror and alarm, has to escape for his life to the land of Midian where he
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.680]   waited forty years before he came back to deliver the children of Israel at the command
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.800]   of God.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:28.520]   But you see the resentment, you see the bitterness, you see the abuse, you see the hatred that
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.360]   is manifested towards Moses.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.920]   Moses has come to deliver them.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.840]   But they abominate him, they hate him, they treat him vilely.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.360]   They reject him with passion and with fear.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.480]   Well, there it is.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.720]   That's what happened to Moses, says Stephen, in addressing the Sanhedrin.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.920]   You see how he's developing his case?
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.480]   He says, "That's exactly what you've just done to the Son of God.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   That's what you're doing now by arresting me and putting me on trial and by regarding
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.160]   this message of his that I'm preaching to you as blasphemy."
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.680]   Look how this was manifested in the case of our blessed Lord.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.240]   I could give you many examples and illustrations, but listen to this, after the sixth chapter
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.600]   of Luke's Gospel.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.240]   It's almost incredible, but this literally happened.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:26.720]   "The man that was brought to our Lord on one occasion had a withered hand.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.960]   And our Lord said to him, 'Rise up and stand forth in the midst.'
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   And he arose and stood forth.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:40.240]   Then said Jesus unto them, the religious authorities standing by, 'I will ask you one thing.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.680]   Is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   it?'"
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:53.120]   You see, these Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law, they didn't recognize
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   our Lord.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.120]   They said, "Who is this fellow?
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.400]   He hasn't been trained by us.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.640]   He hasn't got the stamp of the authority upon him.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   He's an upstart."
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.320]   And our Lord knew this, so he puts the question, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.320]   or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.920]   And looking round upon them all, he said unto the men, "Stretch forth thine hand."
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.120]   The men with the withered hand, who wasn't able to move his hand, that was his trouble.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.680]   Our Lord says to him, "Stretch forth thy hand."
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   And he did so.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.520]   And his hand was restored whole as the other.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.000]   What was the reaction of these religious authorities to that?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Here it is.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.280]   "And they were filled with madness and communed with one another what they might do to Jesus."
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:46.360]   An exact repetition, you see, of what the children of Israel have done long ago in the
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   case of Moses.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:55.960]   Here is our blessed Lord performing a miracle, but because he doesn't belong to their particular
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.640]   set, doesn't fit in with their ideas and rules and regulations, the miracle means nothing
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   to them.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.680]   They're filled with hatred and communed together as to what they can do with him.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.440]   They're blind to the miracle.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.680]   They're blind to the fact and are governed by their bitter prejudice, nothing else.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   This is what sin does.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.800]   And of course, towards the end of his life, you see it still more clearly.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.040]   That's why I read to you that portion out of the 23rd chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:34.520]   Did you see the bitterness, the hatred, the malice, the spleen, the mocking and the jarring?
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.880]   And even when he was on the cross, they taunted him.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.760]   "Ah," they said, "thou that savest others, come down from that cross, save thyself."
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.000]   They mocked him, they jared at him.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.960]   Now the point I'm making is the bitterness, the hatred, the violence of the feeling.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.760]   This is what sin does, my dear friends.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.320]   Can't you see it?
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.200]   The Apostle Paul says that this is true of all natural men.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.960]   The natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.160]   The carnal men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.200]   unto him, neither can he ne'er them.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:19.080]   And again in Romans 8, 7, he says, "The carnal mind is enmity against God."
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.120]   He doesn't merely say that they don't believe in God.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.160]   It is enmity against God.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.320]   He is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.840]   This is human nature without Christ.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.960]   This is what sin does to us all.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:40.720]   You remember how Paul puts it again to Titus in the third chapter, these are the words,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:48.080]   "We ourselves also were at one time foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.800]   and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another."
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.520]   That's what we all are by nature.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.840]   There's only one hope for us and that is the grace of God.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.240]   But this you see is what sin does to us.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.960]   And look how Paul was treated.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.080]   Look how the apostles were treated.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.120]   Nearly all of them were put to death.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.600]   Men and women hated them.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.200]   They reviled them.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.160]   They regarded them as the off-scouring of the world.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.280]   Well now, this is what is put before us, not only in the speech of Stephen to the Sanhedrin,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.240]   it is the history that is put before us in the New Testament.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.180]   And as our Lord says, it's the history of the Old Testament also.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.960]   These people were always killing and persecuting the prophets, the messengers of God, and they
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.400]   did it above all to the very Son of God himself.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   Now, here's objective history for us.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   But my dear friend, the question for you and for me is this.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.560]   Is this true of us?
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.120]   Have you believed this gospel?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.560]   Or have you rejected it?
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.680]   Have you shone the same scorn and derision?
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.760]   Have you dismissed this as unutterable folly?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.960]   That's what the Greeks did and the clever people in the time of our Lord and the apostles.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   Have you done that?
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.840]   It's not merely a question of the mind, it's a question of the heart.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.960]   Now, what I'm trying to do is this.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.160]   I'm asking you to look on objectively at this thing.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.200]   Look at it as Stephen pictures it in the children of Israel and old.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.600]   Look at the same thing in the person of the members of the Sanhedrin and the Jews in the
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.880]   first century.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   Look at it objectively.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.600]   Oh, it's sometimes easier to see a thing when you see it in somebody else, isn't it?
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.480]   That's where this history is of so great value to us.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.660]   If you put a question about yourself, you're on the defensive always.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.740]   But if you see a picture, an objective picture, you're more detached.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.720]   The prejudice isn't working so violently, and then you're beginning to see it.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.000]   In other words, I'm doing tonight exactly what the prophet Nathan did, you remember,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   with King David.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.040]   David had done a terrible thing, but he wasn't conscious of it.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.160]   David was quite pleased with himself.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.040]   He'd murdered a man in order that he might have his wife, and he'd committed adultery
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   on top.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   Adultery and murder.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   David was quite happy.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   All was well.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:24.520]   So God sent Nathan the prophet to David, and he told him to tell David a story about a
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.040]   certain wrong that had been done among some of his people.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.320]   How one man had taken the only sheep of some poor widow.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   He'd got plenty himself.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.000]   He took the other one.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Terrible thing to do.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.880]   And David listened to the story, and he was bristling with indignation and fury.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.960]   This man, he says, who does a thing like this, this is intolerable.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.720]   This man must be punished.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.040]   Nathan stopped and looked at him and said, "Thou art the man."
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:58.920]   We see these things in others, and sometimes that's the way that we are brought to see
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.840]   the same thing in ourselves.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:08.040]   May God grant that as we look at this old history tonight, that the Spirit of God may
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.760]   apply to us, that he may bring it to us and say, "Thou art the man."
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.600]   That's exactly what you were doing.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.560]   You look on and you say, "But we could never do a thing like that."
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.960]   But my dear friend, if you're not a believer in Christ, it's the very thing you are doing.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.720]   There's nothing more terrible than this.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.240]   This attitude of the heart is even worse than the failure of the intellect and the understanding
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   to comprehend.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.600]   Now, look at the details of this.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.040]   Let me just give you some headings for us to see the horror of sin, what it makes us
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.080]   do, how it blinds us and makes us bitter.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.720]   Did you notice how the first thing that it does is, it always makes us feel instinctively
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.880]   that God is against us?
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.560]   Where it is in the story, Moses is sent by God to deliver them.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.720]   Their immediate reaction to Moses is to feel he's against them.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   "Who is this?
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   What right has he got?"
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.480]   Instinctively, they're against him, the very one sent by God to deliver them.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:23.680]   And this is precisely what sin does to all men by nature.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.640]   And it is the most astonishing thing of all.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.720]   Man by nature is against God.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   Why?
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.480]   Well, because he thinks that God is against him, instinctively.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.600]   That's why man hates God.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:47.400]   His idea of God is of some despot, some awful power, lowering over us, waiting to do harm
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   to us.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   God's against us.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.120]   That's what mankind thinks instinctively.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   That's its reaction.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.240]   Isn't that true of the world today?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.520]   That's why God is not only hated, but they're always trying to clutch at any argument they
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.160]   can find anywhere against God.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.040]   God is the opponent of the human race.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.480]   Belief in God is the opium of the people.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   That's the thing.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:20.600]   And these ideas are held, I say, with great bitterness and uttered with great vituperation.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:30.760]   That's the attitude of men by nature to the God who made him and gave him the great dignity
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.680]   of making him in his own image and likeness.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.920]   The God who has made us and that we are ourselves.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.040]   The God who has given us the gifts we have.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.320]   Look at the modern world.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.680]   It's just repeating what the Apostle Paul tells us the world did of all with regard
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   to God they worshipped, he says, the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.120]   And we are doing it today.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.560]   We are worshipping men.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.160]   We are worshipping human ability, human inventions.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.840]   "Lord, unless we say."
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.440]   How is it that man is capable of making inventions?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.020]   Has man generated and produced his own powers?
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.320]   Is it man who has created his propensities and faculties?
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   Of course not.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   They are all God-given.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   "What hast thou," as Paul puts it to the Corinthians, "what hast thou that thou
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   hast not received?"
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.920]   You see, but this is what sin does to us.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.800]   It makes us fail to realize that it is God who has not only made us but given us all
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.400]   the gifts that he has given us.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.600]   Look at the blessings that he showers upon us so regularly.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.720]   What if he withheld the sun and the rain?
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.960]   All your clever inventions would do nothing.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.400]   The best seed in the world and all your tractors would be of no value if God didn't send
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.600]   the rain and the sun and the seasons.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.360]   Oh, he's the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.600]   He causes his sun to rise and the evil and the good and sendeth his rain upon the just
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:16.520]   and upon the unjust, but above all, God, in spite of our sin and rebellion against him,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:22.960]   has conceived a plan and a purpose of salvation, moved by nothing but his own grace and his
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.720]   own love and his own eternal heart.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:33.400]   Oh, he's done this, he's purposed it, he's planned it, he's put it into operation.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.600]   And yet, man by nature hates him.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.360]   The natural man does hate God.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.760]   The carnal mind is enmity against God.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.800]   It's no use trying to say that that isn't true.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.440]   I've often said this because I've so often been told that people say, "But you mustn't
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.200]   say that I'm a God-hater.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   I don't hate God.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.840]   I've always believed in God."
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.960]   That's what they like to think, many of them.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.440]   Of course, many don't even say that.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.960]   They deny the whole thing as a lot of rubbish and nonsense.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.840]   But there are those who say, "No, no, I'm not a Christian as you describe it, but I've
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.360]   always been a believer in God."
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.040]   I've never found it at all difficult to show them that they've never believed in God at
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   all.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.920]   What they've believed in is some of their own ideas as to what God ought to be like.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   The moment they are confronted by the God who has revealed himself in the Bible, they
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:32.360]   very soon show their hatred of him, invariably.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.720]   "No, no, man is a God-hater.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.480]   He feels God's against him."
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.280]   The first thing the natural man tends to do whenever he's taken ill or a loved one is
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.280]   taken ill, "Why should this happen to me?
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   What have I done?
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   God is against me."
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.440]   It's instinctive.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.760]   It was here in these children of Israel.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:02.320]   It is still the truth about men and women who reject the Son of God tonight.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:09.880]   The second thing we notice is this, that man in sin always resents God's interference in
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   his life.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.000]   Here are these poor children of Israel.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.520]   They've become slaves.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.920]   They've been terribly maltreated.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.280]   This king arose who knew not Joseph, and he treated them in an abominable manner.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   They were nothing but slaves, and they were being beaten by cruel taskmasters.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.120]   They were asked to do the impossible, and now an edict had gone out from the king that
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:38.560]   every male child that was born to an Israelite woman was to be put to death at birth.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.040]   Here they are.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.240]   God puts it into the heart of Moses to visit them, gives him a commission to lead them
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   out to liberty.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   What's their reaction to this?
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.960]   Well, it is almost incredible, isn't it?
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   You see, this is the advantage of looking on at the thing in an objective manner.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.800]   Their immediate reaction to that was to resent this interference.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:08.360]   "Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:13.240]   Who are you to come and tell us what to do and what not to do, and to interfere in our
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   affairs?"
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.040]   That was their reaction in that condition to God sending his servant Moses and to Moses'
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.560]   appearance amongst them.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.720]   That's precisely the attitude of mankind this evening.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.520]   That's their attitude to the Bible.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.720]   That's the attitude of the modern men to preaching.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:37.920]   That's the attitude to this message that condemns us and our sins and our way of life.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.560]   We dislike this, this interference.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.220]   We want to go on living in our own way, but then suddenly something happens.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:51.000]   We see a text somewhere or we meet somebody and we have a talk, we listen to a sermon,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and we're disturbed.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.360]   Our immediate reaction is, "This is wrong.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.160]   What right has he to disturb me or to interfere in my life?
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.640]   I don't like this message that comes and tells me that I'm wrong, that my way of life is
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   unjustifiable.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.440]   It convicts me of sin.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.160]   It makes me unhappy, and I resent it.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.760]   I don't want this."
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:13.800]   And then when it calls me to repentance, to change my life, to give up and to do something
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.040]   else, I say, "Now, who is this?
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   What is this?"
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   "What's this?" we say.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   "Who is God?
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.520]   What right has God to interfere in my life?
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   What right have you Christian people to interfere in my life, to speak to me about my way of
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.560]   living, to talk to me about your so-called Savior?"
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.280]   "No, no," we say, "and you are type of life.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.720]   I'm not interested in it.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.760]   This is the modern attitude.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.080]   My life's my own, and I claim I have a right to live my own life in my own way.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.600]   Mine's your own business.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.840]   Who has set you up as a judge and a ruler?
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.800]   What right have you to come and interfere?"
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.120]   Isn't that our instinctive reaction?
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:58.320]   It's the instinctive reaction of all men and women when they're convicted of sin.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.080]   They dislike it.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.800]   They feel that this is an interference, an unjustifiable interference.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   When you're trying to help people, when you're trying to do them good, when you're trying
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.120]   to show them the evil of the way and the consequences of that, and begin to suggest to them another
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.960]   way, they resent this interfering in my life.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.560]   That's why people make fun of the Bible.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.680]   That's why they pour scorn on it.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.960]   That's why they ridicule it.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.760]   It isn't just rejection.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.880]   There is always the element of bitterness, animosity.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   There is a hatred.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   There is a malice.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.200]   They can't abide this.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.400]   It's all here, you see.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   What else?
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:43.000]   Well, it becomes worse and worse the more you take it down.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.720]   There is always a special resentment against God's particular way of deliverance.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.120]   That's what happened in this old case.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.960]   It came into the heart of Moses, God put it there.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.560]   God sent him, and as we read, he supposed that his brethren would have understood how
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.400]   that God, by his hand, would deliver them.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.200]   But you see, they not only didn't understand it, they resented it.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.840]   This is the language they use.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   This man turned to him and said, "Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.720]   Have you come to tell us how we are to live and how we are to behave?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.200]   Have you come to tell us how we are to get deliverance?
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.360]   Who has appointed you?
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   What's your authority?
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.960]   What right have you to do this?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.320]   Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us in this manner?"
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.800]   Now this is the most serious thing of all.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.160]   And this is always the point where you'll find the bitterness and the resentment and
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.400]   the passion of mankind against this way of salvation always in its most extreme form.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.800]   For, let's be clear about this, God has his way of salvation.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.920]   And it's a very clear one.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   It's a very explicit one.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.360]   And he calls upon us to submit to it.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.320]   Now Moses had been given the way of salvation by God.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.880]   God had told him how he was to deliver these people.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.080]   He'd got the plan and he's beginning to put it into execution.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   That's the very point at which they stand against him.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   "What's your authority?
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Who are you?
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   What right have you to do this?"
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.960]   "No, no," they say.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.360]   They want to express their opinions.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.120]   They must be brought into consultation, as it were.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.520]   They're not prepared to receive it as God has ordained it and as God has sent it.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:38.400]   But this is still the cause of trouble.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:46.520]   God's way of salvation is perfectly plain and perfectly clear.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.200]   It is in Christ Jesus and in him alone.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.600]   It's absolutely exclusive.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.560]   Now that's why I quoted to you at the beginning those words of Peter that are recorded in
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   Acts 4, 12.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.920]   "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under him given
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.680]   amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.880]   This is the Christian message.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.960]   This is God's way of salvation.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.400]   It is all in this one person and in him exclusively.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.640]   There is no second name.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.360]   There is only one name.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.680]   You mustn't put any name by the name of Jesus.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.260]   If you do, you're detracting from his.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:36.200]   He is the Son of God and he makes unique claims.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.640]   He says, "I am the light of the world.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.720]   I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.400]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.480]   It's all in him.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.880]   It's all alone in him.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.480]   He needs no help, no assistance.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.200]   You mustn't put anybody by his side.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.920]   "I am the way, the truth, the life."
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.160]   It is exclusively in him, the Son of God.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:09.680]   None other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:18.240]   And it even narrows that down by telling us that he saves specifically by dying for us
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.680]   on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:28.120]   And this is of all points the point at which the modern man not only displays his resentment
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:37.960]   against this gospel but his hatred of it, the blood of Christ, the blood of Christ.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:46.520]   And yet this is the message, that the Son of God came into this world to save us and
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:52.680]   that the only way whereby he could save us was by dying in our stead.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:38:03.040]   "Who his own self took our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.320]   should live unto righteousness.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   By whose stripes we are healed."
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   He's done it.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   He's done it all.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   He said it is finished.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.080]   There's nothing that you need to add.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.120]   You can't add to it.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   If you try to, you're derogating and detracting and subtracting from what he has done once
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   and forever.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.760]   He could cry out on the cross saying, "It is finished.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   Everything has been done.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.320]   God has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:36.360]   He's borne the punishment to the last ounce."
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.840]   But it meant that his body was broken and that his blood was shed.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.520]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.360]   He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that he might
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.760]   taste death for every man.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.120]   There is only one way into the presence of God in the earliest of all.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.000]   It is by the blood of Jesus.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.760]   This is what the world hates.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:16.720]   They pose its sarcasm, its scorn, its ridicule above all upon the blood of Christ.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.600]   It laughs at it, it mocks at it, it jeers at it.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.520]   This theology of blood it says.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.420]   It's simply repeating what the members of the Sanhedrin did.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.600]   It is simply repeating what the children of Israel had done long ago with Moses.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.840]   "Who sent thee as a ruler and a judge over us?
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.280]   Who's given you the right to tell us about the way of salvation?"
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   But he has it.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   He has it alone.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.720]   He's the appointed of God.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.960]   He's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the whole world.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.160]   It's in him and in him alone.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.440]   This is the thing that man objects to most of all.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.560]   He says, "Can't I do something about it?
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.960]   Don't I play a part?
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.720]   Don't others play a part?
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.360]   Mustn't we help him some?
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.720]   Mustn't we make our contribution?"
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.480]   The answer is no.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.760]   He has done it all.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.840]   But if you try and bring anything in of man in any shape or form, you're detracting
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:23.400]   from his eternal glory and the completeness of his divine saviourhood.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:29.480]   But you see, this is what mankind hates.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:35.160]   It always likes a religion that gives us a lot to do.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.440]   This is true of every section of the Christian church, every form of religion.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.360]   They all want to be doing something, doing their part, adding their bit, bringing something
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.000]   else in, making it complicated, adding to him.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   No, no.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.320]   It's all in him and in him exclusively.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.040]   None other name given under him amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.240]   He decides.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.440]   He is judge and ruler.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.560]   He's appointed by God to be.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.280]   It is God's way, and you and I have to submit to it.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.880]   And not only that, you see, the gospel not only tells us that the Son of God had to die
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:21.200]   and his blood shed before we could be saved, it also tells us that we are so rotten and
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.520]   so vile that we must be born again.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.640]   There it is.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:36.480]   What our blessed Lord, you remember, said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again."
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   Doesn't matter who you are.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.440]   He was a Jew, brought up as a Jew, circumcised.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.480]   The Jewish church had done everything for him.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.000]   There was nothing more to be done than he was a leader to boot.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.600]   No good.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.440]   You must be born again.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:04.640]   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.880]   And it's still the same message.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.700]   That all of us are in such a state and condition as the result of sin that we cannot be improved.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.520]   We need to be made anew.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.360]   We must be regenerated.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.640]   We must be born again.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.680]   And the world hates this.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   It abominates it.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.360]   What the natural man hates above everything else is the doctrine of the death of Christ
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.000]   and the doctrine of the rebirth, regeneration.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.120]   He's interested in Christ as a person, Christ as a teacher, interested in the ethical teaching
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.680]   of the Sermon on the Mount, interested in many other things.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.840]   But when you tell him that nothing but his death can save us and that we need to be born
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.240]   anew of the Spirit before we can be the children of God, he hates it.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.680]   He resents it.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.560]   He says it's insulting.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.080]   He says, "I admit I'm not perfect.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.280]   I'm not a hundred percent saint, perhaps, but you mustn't tell me that I'm so bad, that
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.920]   I can't do anything, that I must be born anew, and that he must die for me."
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.280]   This is insulting.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.920]   That's the attitude of the modern man.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.140]   And he resents it with bitterness.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:17.240]   He rejects it with scorn.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:22.160]   And so I go on with my analysis.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:28.080]   You see, man by nature not only resents this, he fights against it.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.320]   He thrusts it away from him.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.160]   That's exactly what these people did with Moses.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:43.080]   He that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, say, who made thee a ruler and a judge
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.280]   over us.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:55.960]   And that is what mankind is still doing with the Lord Jesus Christ and his great salvation.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.000]   It fails to see that he's come to do us good.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.520]   As Moses visited his people, so it was given to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist,
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.000]   to say, "God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.040]   The very Son of God came into this world.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.760]   He's visited this world in order to save us."
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:24.800]   And yet the world thrusts him away, pushes him aside, has no interest in him, cries out
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.920]   away with him, crucify him, with all the bitterness that was characteristic of the first century.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.600]   But, and did you notice this, I wonder, that this terrible thing called sin has such a
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:45.160]   devastating effect upon us and such a perverting influence upon us that it even makes us take
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.560]   sides with our greatest enemies.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.680]   That's exactly what these people did.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.440]   This man, he said, "Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.600]   And then he goes on, "Wilt thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?"
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.000]   And Moses understood exactly what he meant by that because I read, "Then fled Moses
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.320]   at this saying and was a stranger in the land of Mibbion."
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   Why?
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Well, he understood that the men were saying this.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.200]   He said, "All right, I saw what you did yesterday and as you're coming forward and
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.600]   setting yourself up as a judge and a ruler and you are going to take charge of us, you're
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   a usurper.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.280]   You are a conceited fellow who thinks he knows all about it and asking us to follow you.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.040]   All right, I will go and let the authorities know what you did yesterday."
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.280]   You see what the fool is saying?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.640]   What else can you call him?
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   What is he but a fool?
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.800]   Here is a man in the captivity and the bondage of the Egyptians.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.960]   Here is a slave and a serf.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.160]   He takes sides with the Egyptians against his own deliverer.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.840]   That's exactly what they did.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:59.640]   They took the side of their oppressors, their masters, as over and against the God-appointed
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   deliverer.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.000]   And did you notice what we read together in the 23rd chapter of Luke's Gospel at the
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   beginning?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Did you notice how the high priests and the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.880]   and the doctors of the law, all these people joined with Pilate against the Son of God?
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:25.200]   They invoked the aid of the Roman power that had recently conquered their country and that
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.600]   was holding them down in oppression.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.720]   They side with their oppressors.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:38.520]   And they perpetuate their own self-defeat and reject the deliverer and the prophet's
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   salvation.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:47.080]   And it is what men are still doing in his folly.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.840]   You know what you are doing when you reject this Gospel?
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:56.640]   You are not only rejecting the Son of God and God's marvelous offer of salvation, you
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.240]   are putting yourself onto the side of the devil.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.920]   You are putting yourself onto the side of the one who has caused you misery.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.160]   The world was made perfect, it was paradise.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.920]   Why didn't it continue as paradise?
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.720]   Because the devil came in, the enemy of God, the enemy of men, because he is made in the
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   image of God.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:20.560]   The devil came in, he caused the chaos, he is the cause of disease, unhappiness, shame,
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   misery, sin, remorse, hell, all that is against us is caused by the devil.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.760]   And as you reject this Gospel and as you make fun of the Bible and as you pour scorn on
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.840]   the blood of Christ and on the resurrection and all the great facts of the Gospel, what
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.840]   are you doing?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.320]   You are taking sides with your own tyrant, with your own oppressor, with the one who
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.960]   keeps you in the misery you are in and the failure you are in and will land you eventually
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.920]   in hell and eternal damnation.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.520]   That is what you are doing.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:03.440]   You are turning against your deliverer and putting yourself on the side of and helping
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:08.360]   your own greatest enemy.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   What a terrible thing sin is.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.640]   Oh, how it affects us.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.880]   The prejudice it raises against this which is sent to deliver us makes us bitter and
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.360]   boastful in our rejection of it, especially at its most glorious points.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.480]   And that brings me to my last word.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:37.120]   These children of Israel reacted like this and behaved in this manner to Moses.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:44.640]   I have already had the privilege of telling most of you what it was, what it meant to
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.040]   Moses to appear amongst them.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.560]   You remember what it was going to cost him.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.320]   Son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.160]   Wealth, prosperity, popularity, applause, military power.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.240]   Oh, there was nothing in his way.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.680]   He got the best chance the men had ever had.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.040]   It was all there at his feet, as we say.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   Everything that could be desired.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.200]   He is ready to give it all up.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.880]   And to take his side by his own people.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:25.600]   He is ready to sacrifice himself, his prospects, if necessary, his very life.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.840]   And yet, this is how they treat him.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.200]   He who is giving of all to help them.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.640]   They throw it back in his face and spit upon him.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.080]   Threaten him with death and he has to escape for his life.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.800]   Oh, my dear friends, that's but a pale picture in comparison with the great tragedy that
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.040]   is recorded in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.800]   This is what is happening.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:08.640]   Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.880]   made rich.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   Do you want to know what he did?
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   Listen.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.840]   "Let his mind be in you," which was also in Christ Jesus, "who, being in the form of
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:24.560]   God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God," which means he didn't regard this glory
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.520]   that he'd shared with God from eternity as a prize to be held on to.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.520]   What did he do then?
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.980]   Well, he made himself of no reputation.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:37.680]   He took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.440]   And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:52.320]   Even the death of the cross, he gave himself.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.720]   He gave his life.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.480]   He couldn't have given more.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.320]   He gave everything.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.000]   And yet the reaction was, "Away with him.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.440]   Crucify him.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   Not this man, but Barabbas.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.920]   Put this man to death.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:13.400]   Set free the thief, the robber, the man guilty of insurrection.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.240]   My friends, this is something that's happened.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.240]   This is not a fairy tale.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.840]   This is not a story.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.400]   This took place, you know, on Calvary's hill.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.040]   The world rejected its Messiah.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.400]   He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.880]   Though he has forsaken the glory of the courts of heaven and has been born in the likeness
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:41.520]   of sinful flesh and suffered the contradiction of sinners against himself for those years
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.120]   that he was in this world, they spat upon him.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   They mocked him.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.560]   They laughed at him.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.120]   They jeered him.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:56.600]   They finally thrust him away, and they crucified him.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:02.760]   That is the truth about everybody who doesn't believe in him.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:12.200]   It is this terrible perversion as well as madness and blindness that is caused by sin.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.800]   Come, let me put a question to you as reasonable people.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.440]   Look at this story as unfolded by Stephen.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:26.560]   What's your verdict on the action of the children of Israel in their response to Moses?
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.320]   What's your verdict?
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:38.600]   What do you feel about that crowd that shouted in Jerusalem, "Away with him, crucify him"?
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.680]   Look on at it objectively.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.880]   What's your verdict?
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:48.080]   But my dear friend, what have you done?
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.480]   Thou art the man.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:59.320]   If you don't see tonight that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has died, given
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:08.200]   his life for your salvation, borne your punishment in his own body, dead, buried, risen again,
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.800]   seated at the right hand of God in the glory everlasting, for you, if you don't see tonight
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:22.440]   that he has done that and that that and that alone saves you without any addition, you
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.720]   are guilty of the same thing.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.640]   Thou art the man.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:38.240]   May God have mercy upon all who have not submitted to him as their only Savior and Redeemer,
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.360]   their all-sufficient Savior and Redeemer.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:49.320]   May God the Spirit open eyes that we may see him in all the plenitude and the fullness
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:56.520]   of his divine Saviorhood, that we may fall at his feet and say, "Thou, O Christ, art
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.920]   all I want, more than all in thee I find."
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   Thou art enough.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   Take me.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.920]   Amen.
