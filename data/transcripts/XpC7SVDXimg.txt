[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   We should never, and I never, sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to destroy us.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.640]   They won't do it.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.600]   If somebody threatens to eliminate you, as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then, and people discounted it,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.380]   well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and act to prevent it early on.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.060]   Don't let them have the means to do so, because that may be too late.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220]   The following is a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.000]   Prime Minister of Israel, currently serving his sixth term in office.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.120]   He's one of the most influential, powerful, and controversial men in the world,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.760]   leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.620]   As we spoke, and as I speak now, large-scale protests are breaking out all over Israel
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.620]   over this government's proposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.660]   This is a conversation that I'm going to be talking about in a moment.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:09.240]   Given the current intense political battles in Israel, our previous intention to speak for three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.680]   but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.800]   I will also interview people who harshly disagree with the words spoken in this conversation.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.900]   I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with historians and activists,
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.160]   and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.640]   destruction, and destruction.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.400]   and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.840]   For this, I will travel anywhere, no matter how dangerous,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.740]   if there's any chance it may help add to understanding and love in the world.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.080]   I believe in the power of conversation, to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.960]   I know I'm underqualified and underskilled for these conversations,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.480]   so I will often fall short.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.280]   And I will certainly get attacked, derided, and slandered.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.460]   But I will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn, to improve,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.900]   and no matter what, never give in to cynicism.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.920]   This life, this world of ours, is too beautiful not to keep trying.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.940]   Trying to do some good, in whatever way each of us know how.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.860]   I love you all.
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.140]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   In the description.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.540]   You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world,
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.520]   but you're also hated by many.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.280]   In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.420]   So if there's a young man or a young woman listening to this right now
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.840]   who have such hate in their heart,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.280]   what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.580]   I disagree with it.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580]   I disagree with the premise of your question.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.260]   I think I have enjoyed a very broad support around the world.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.360]   There are certain corners in which we have this animosity that you describe,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.020]   and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers and news organs and so on in the United States.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.040]   But it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support that I have.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.560]   I just gave an interview on an Iranian channel.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   16 million viewers.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.380]   I gave another one.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.000]   I just did a little video a few years ago.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.040]   25 million viewers from Iran.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.360]   Certainly no hate there, I have to tell you.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.300]   Not from the regime.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.620]   And when I go around the world, and I've been around the world,
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.040]   people want to hear what we have to say,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.800]   what I have to say as a leader of Israel,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.540]   So I disagree with that.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.540]   And the most important thing that goes against what you said
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.540]   is the respect that we receive from the Arab world
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.540]   and the fact that we've made four historic peace agreements with Arab countries.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540]   They made it with me.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.540]   They didn't make it with anyone else.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.540]   And I respect them and they respect me.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.540]   And probably more to come.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.540]   So I think the premise is wrong.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.540]   That's all.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   Well, there's a lot of love, yes.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.520]   A lot of leaders.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520]   A lot of people are collaborating.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   Respect, I said.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   Okay, all right.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   Well, it's a spectrum.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   But there is people who don't have good things to say about Israel,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   who do have hate in their heart for Israel.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   And what can you say to those people?
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   Well, I think they don't know very much.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   I think they're guided by a lot of ignorance.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   They don't know about Israel.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   They don't know that Israel is a stellar democracy,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.500]   that it happens to be one of the most intense,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   advanced societies on the planet,
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   that what Israel develops helps humanity in every field,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   in medicine, in agriculture, in the environment,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   in telecoms, and talk about AI in a minute,
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   but changing the world for the better,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   and spreading this among six continents.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   We've sent rescue teams more than any other country in the world,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   and we're one-tenth of one percent of the world's population.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.480]   But when there's an earthquake
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.480]   or a devastation in Haiti or in the Philippines,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   Israel is there.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   When there's an earthquake, a devastating earthquake in Turkey,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Turkey, Israel was there.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   When there's something in Nepal, Israel is there.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   And it's a second country.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   It's the second country after, in one case, India,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   or after, in another case, the United States,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   Israel is there.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.460]   So you're a student of history.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.460]   You just linger on that philosophical notion of hate,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.460]   that part of human nature.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460]   If you look at World War II,
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.460]   what do you learn from human nature,
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   from the rise of the Third Reich,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   and the rise of somebody like Hitler,
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.460]   and the hate that permeates that?
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.460]   Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip bad things in the bud.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.460]   You have to--there's a Latin term that says,
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.440]   "Obstaprincipi."
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   You have to stop bad things when they're small.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   And the deliberate hatred,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   the incitement of hatred against one community,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   its demonization, delegitimization that goes with it,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   is a very dangerous thing.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   And that happened in the case of the Jews.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   What started with the Jews soon spread to all of humanity.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.420]   So what we've learned is that's what we should--we should never,
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.420]   sit aside and say, "Oh, they're just threatening to destroy us.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.420]   They won't do it."
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.420]   If somebody threatens to eliminate you,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.420]   as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then,
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.420]   and people discounted it, well,
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.420]   if somebody threatens to annihilate us,
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   take them seriously and act to prevent it early on.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.420]   Don't let them have the means to do so,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.420]   because that may be too late.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.420]   So in those threats underlying that hatred,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.400]   how much of it is anti-Zionism
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   and how much of it is anti-Semitism?
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   I don't distinguish between the two.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   You can't say, "Well, I'm okay with Jews,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   but I just don't think there should be a Jewish state."
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   It's like saying, "I'm not anti-American.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   I just don't think there should be an America."
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   That's basically what people are saying
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   vis-à-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   When you say anti-Zionism, you're saying that Jewish people
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   don't have a right to have a state of their own.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.380]   And that is a denial of--
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.380]   of a basic--a basic principle that, I think,
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   completely unmasks what is involved here.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   Those who oppose the Jewish people oppose the Jewish state.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   If we jump from human history
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.380]   to the current particular moment,
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   there's protests in Israel now
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.380]   about the proposed judicial reform
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.360]   that gives power to your government to override the Supreme Court.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   So the critics say that this gives too much power to you,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   virtually making you a dictator.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   Yeah, well, that's ridiculous.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   The mere fact that you have so many demonstrations and protests,
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   some dictatorship, huh?
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   There's a lot of democracy here,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   more rambunctious and more robust
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   than just anywhere on the planet.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   Can you steel man the case that this gives--
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.340]   this may give too much power to the coalition
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.340]   government to the prime minister,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.340]   not just to you, but to those who follow?
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.340]   No, I think that's complete hogwash,
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.340]   because I think there's a--
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.340]   there's a--very few people who are demonstrating against this.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   Quite a few, quite many don't have an idea
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.340]   what is being discussed.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.340]   They're basically being sloganized.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.340]   You can sloganize--you know something about,
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.340]   not mass media right now, but the social network.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.340]   You can basically feed, deliberately,
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.320]   with big data and big money,
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   you can just feed slogans and get into people's minds.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   because you can tell me more about that.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   And you can create mass mobilization
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   based on these absurd slogans.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   So here's where I come from and what we're doing,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   what we're trying to do,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   and what we've changed in what we're trying to do.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   I'm a 19th century Democrat in my--
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   small d, yes--in my views.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   That is, I view--I ask the question,
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.300]   "What is democracy?"
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300]   Okay?
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   So democracy is the will of the majority
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   and the protection of the rights of--
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   they call it the rights of the minority,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   but I say the rights of the individual.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   Okay?
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.300]   So how do you balance the two?
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.300]   Okay?
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   How do you get the--how do you avoid mobocracy?
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   Okay?
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.300]   And how do you avoid dictatorship,
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.300]   the opposite side?
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.300]   The way you avoid it is something that was built,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.300]   essentially, by British philosophers
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.280]   and French philosophers, but--
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   was encapsulated by the founding fathers of the United States.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   You create a balance between the three branches of government.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   Okay?
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   The legislative, the executive, and the judiciary.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   And this balance is what assures the balance between
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   majority rights and individual rights.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   And you have to balance all of them. Okay.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   That balance was maintained in Israel in its first 50 years
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.260]   and was gradually overtaken.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.260]   And basically broken by the most activist judicial court
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260]   on the planet.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.260]   That's what happened here.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.260]   And gradually over the last two, three decades,
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.260]   the court arrogated for itself the powers of the parliament
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.260]   and the executive.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.260]   So we're trying to bring it back into line.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.260]   Bringing it back into line into what is common
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.260]   in all parliamentary democracies and in the United States
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260]   doesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.240]   and bringing it to the other side.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   We want checks and balances, not unrivaled power.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   Just as we said, we want an independent judiciary,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   but not an all-powerful judiciary.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   That balance does not mean bringing it back into line.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   Doesn't mean that you can have the parliament,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   our Knesset, override any decision that the Supreme Court does.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   So I pretty much early on said,
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   after the judicial reform was introduced,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   get rid of the idea of sweeping override clause
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.220]   that would have with 61 votes,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.220]   that's a majority of one,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.220]   you can just nullify any Supreme Court decision.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.220]   So let's move it back into the center.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.220]   So that's gone.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.220]   And most of the criticism on the judicial reform
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   was based on an unlimited override clause,
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.220]   which I've said is simply not going to happen.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.220]   People are discussing something that already for six months
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.220]   does not exist.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.220]   The second point that we received criticism on
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:29.200]   was the structure of how do you choose Supreme Court judges?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   How do you choose them?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   And the critics of the reform are saying that the idea
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   that elected officials should choose Supreme Court judges
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   is the end of democracy.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   If that's the case, the United States is not a democracy.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   Neither is France.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   And now there are just, I don't know,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   just about every democracy on the planet.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   So there is a view here that you can't have the sorted hands
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.180]   of elected officials involved in the choosing of judges.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went so far
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.180]   that effectively the sitting judges have an effective veto
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.180]   on choosing judges,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.180]   which means that this is a self-selecting court
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.180]   that just perpetrates itself.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.180]   And we want to correct that.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.180]   Again, we want to correct it in a balanced way.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.180]   And that's basically what we're trying to do.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   So I think there's a lot of misinformation about that.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.160]   We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   its first 50 years.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   And it was a stellar democracy.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   It still is.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   Israel is a democracy, will remain a democracy,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.160]   a vibrant democracy.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   And believe me, the fact that people are arguing
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   and demonstrating in the streets and protesting
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   is just the best proof of that.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   And that's how it will remain.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   We spoke about tech companies offline.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   There's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.140]   Can you speak to why?
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.140]   Why do large and small companies have a future in Israel?
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.140]   Because Israel is a free market economy.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.140]   I had something to do with that.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.140]   I introduced dozens and dozens of free market reforms
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.140]   that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.140]   to within a very short time to $54,000.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.140]   That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF.
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:29.120]   And we've overtaken in that Japan, France, Britain, Germany,
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   and how did that happen?
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   Because we unleashed the genius that we have
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.120]   and the initiative and the entrepreneurship
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   that is latent in our population.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   And to do that, we had to create free markets.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   So we created that.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   So Israel has one of the most vibrant free market economies in the world.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.120]   And the second thing we have is a permanent investment
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   in conceptual products because we have a permanent investment
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.100]   in the military and our security services.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   Creating basically knowledge workers
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100]   who then become knowledge entrepreneurs.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.100]   And so we create this structure.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.100]   And that's not going to go away.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   There's been a decline in investments in high tech globally.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.100]   I think that's driven by many factors,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   but the most important one is the interest rate,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   which I think will fluctuate up and down.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   But Israel will remain a very attractive country
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.080]   because it produces so many, so many knowledge workers
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   and so many people.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   And so we have to create a knowledge based economy.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   And it's changing so rapidly.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   The world is changing.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   You're looking for the places that have innovation.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   The future belongs to those who innovate.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   Israel is the preeminent innovation nation.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   It has few competitors.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   And I would say, all right, where do you have this close,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.060]   cross-disciplinary fermentation
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.060]   in Israel?
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.060]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.060]   We used to be just telecoms because people went out
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.060]   of the military intelligence, RNSA.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.060]   But that's been now broad-based.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.060]   So you find it in medicine.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.060]   You find it in biology.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.060]   You find it in agri-tech.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.060]   You find it everywhere.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.060]   Everything is becoming technologized.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   And in Israel, everybody is dealing in everything.
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.060]   And that's a potent reservoir of talent
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.040]   that the world is not going to pass up.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   So we have a new plant that's coming to us.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   We just had Nvidia coming here.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   And they decided to build a supercomputer in Israel.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   I wonder why.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   We've had Intel coming here and deciding now
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.040]   to invest $25 billion just now in a new plant in Israel.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   I wonder why.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   I don't wonder why.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   They know why.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   Because the talent is here and the freedom is here.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   Then it will remain so.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   - So you had a conversation about AI with Sam Altman
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.020]   of OpenAI and with Elon Musk.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.020]   What's the content of that conversation?
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   What's your vision for sort of this very highest of tech,
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.020]   which is artificial intelligence?
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.020]   - Well, first of all, I have a high regard
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.020]   for the people I talk to, okay?
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.020]   And I understand that they understand things
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   I don't understand.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.020]   And I don't pretend to understand everything.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.020]   But I do understand one thing.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.020]   I understand that AI is developing at a geometric rate.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.000]   And mostly in political,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   life and in life in general,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   people don't have an intuitive grasp of geometric growth.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   You understand things basically in linear increments.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   And the idea that you're coming up a ski slope
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   is very foreign to people.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So they don't understand it.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And they're naturally also sort of taken aback by it.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Because what do you do?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Okay?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So I think there's several conclusions
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.980]   from my conversations with them and from my experience
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   with other observations that I've been talking about
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.980]   for many years.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.980]   I'm talking about the need to do this.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.980]   Well, the first thing is this.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.980]   There is no possibility of not entering AI with full force.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.980]   Secondly, there is a need for regulation.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.980]   Third, it's not clear there'll be global regulation.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.980]   Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.980]   I certainly cannot say that.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.980]   Now you might say, does it come to control us?
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.960]   Okay, that's a question.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   Does it come to control us?
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   I think that as one observation that I had from these conversations
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   is if it does come to control us,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:58.940]   because I don't see anyone deciding to, you know,
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.940]   avoid the race and cooperate unless you have that threat.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.940]   It doesn't mean you can't regulate AI within countries
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.940]   even without that understanding,
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.940]   but it does mean that there's a limit to regulation
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.940]   because every country will want to make sure that it's not --
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   doesn't give up competitive advantage
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.940]   if there is no universal regulation.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.940]   I think that right now, just as, you know, 10 years ago,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.940]   I read a novel.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.920]   I don't read novels, but I was forced to read one by a scientist
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   or a scientific advisor.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   I read history.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   I read about economics.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   I read about technology.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.920]   I just don't read novels.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920]   Okay.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.920]   And this time, I followed Churchill.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   You know, he said, "Fact is better than fiction."
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   Well, this fiction would become fact.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   And it was a book.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   It was a novel about a Chinese-American future cyber war.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   And I read the book in one sitting,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.900]   called in a team of experts, and I said, "All right,
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.900]   let's turn Israel into one of the world's five cyber powers,
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.900]   and let's do it very quickly."
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.900]   And we did, actually.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900]   We did exactly that.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   I think AI is bigger than that and related to that
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.900]   because it'll affect -- well, cyber affects everything,
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.900]   but AI will affect it even more fundamentally,
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.900]   and the joining of the two could be very powerful.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway for security reasons,
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.900]   and we're doing it.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.880]   But I think what about --
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   what about our databases that are already very robust
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   on the medical records of 98% of our population?
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.880]   Why don't we stick a genetic database on that?
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   Why don't we do other things that could bring magical --
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.880]   what are seemingly magical cures and drugs
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   and medical instruments for that?
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   That's one possibility.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   We have it in, as I said, in every single field.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   The conclusion is this.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   We have to move on AI.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.880]   We are moving on AI just as we moved on cyber,
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   and I think Israel will be one of the leading --
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.880]   one of the leading AI powers in the world.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   The questions I don't have an answer to is,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   where does it go?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   How much does it eat, chew up on jobs?
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   There's an assumption that I'm not sure is true
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.880]   that all previous -- the two big previous --
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.880]   revolutions in the human condition,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.880]   namely the agricultural revolution
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.880]   and the industrial revolution,
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   definitely produced more jobs than they consumed.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Okay?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   That is not obvious to me at all.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   I mean, I could see new jobs creating,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   and yes, I have that comforting statement,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   but it's not quite true,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   because I think on balance,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   they'll probably consume more jobs,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   many more jobs,
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.880]   than they'll create.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   At least in the short term.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   And we don't know about the long term.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   No, I don't know about the long term,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   but I used to have the comfort,
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   being a free market guy,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   I always said, you know,
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   we're going to produce more jobs than,
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   you know, by, I don't know,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   limiting certain government jobs.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   We're actually putting out in the market,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880]   we'll create more jobs,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.880]   which obviously happened.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.880]   You know, we had one telecom company,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   a government company,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   when I said we're going to,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   you know, we're going to create competition,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   they said, you're going to run us out.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   We're not going to have more workers.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   Yeah, they had 13,000 workers.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   They went down to seven,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   but we created another 40,000
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   in the other companies.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   So that was a comforting thought.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   I always knew that was true.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   Okay.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   Not only that,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   I also knew that wealth would spread
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   by opening up the markets,
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   completely opposite to the socialist
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   and semi-socialist creed that they had here.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   They said, you're going to make the rich richer
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   and the poor, poor, no,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   and made everyone richer.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   And actually,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   the people who entered the job market
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   because of the reforms we did
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.880]   actually became a lot richer
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   on the lower ladders
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   of the socioeconomic measure.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   But here's the point.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   I don't know that we will not have
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   So you'll have the end of scarcity.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.880]   You'll have enormous productivity.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   You know, very few people are producing enormous
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   added value.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.880]   You're going to have to tax that
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   to pass it to the others.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.880]   Okay.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   You're going to have to do that.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880]   That's a political question.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   I'm not sure how we answer that.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.880]   What if you tax and somebody else doesn't tax,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   you're going to get everybody to go there.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   That's an issue,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   an international issue
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.880]   that we constantly have to deal with.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   And the second question you have is,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   suppose you solve that problem
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   and you deliver money.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   Okay.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   To those who are not involved in the AI economy,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   what do they do?
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   The first question you ask somebody
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.880]   whom you just met after the polite exchanges is,
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   what do you do?
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   Right?
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   Well, people define themselves by their profession.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   And it's going to be difficult
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   if you don't have a profession.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   And people will spend more time self-searching,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   more time in the,
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   in the arts,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   more time in leisure.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   I understand that.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   If I have to bet,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.880]   it will annihilate many more jobs
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   than it will create
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.880]   and it will force a structural change
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   in our economics,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   in our economic models
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   and in our politics.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   And I'm not sure where it's going to go.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   And that's something we have to respond to
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   at the nation level
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.880]   and just as a human civilization.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Both the threat of AI to just
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   us as a human species,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   and then the effect on the jobs,
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   and like you said,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   cyber security.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   And what do you think?
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.880]   You think it's going to,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   we're going to lose control?
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   No.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   First of all,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   I do believe,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   maybe naively,
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   that it will create more jobs than it takes.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   Write that down and we'll check it.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   It's on record.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   And you know,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   we don't have,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   we don't say we'll check it after our lifetime.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.880]   No, we'll see it in a few years.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.880]   We'll see it in a few years.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   I'm really concerned about cyber security
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   and the nature of how that changes
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   with the power of AI.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   And in terms of existential threats,
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   I think there will be so much threats
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   that aren't existential along the way
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   versus AI taking complete control
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   and becoming sort of superseding the human species.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   Although that is something
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   you should consider seriously
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   because of the exponential growth
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   of its capabilities.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   It's exactly the exponential growth
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   which we understand is before us,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   but we don't know what it is.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   And so,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   we have to think about it before us,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   but we don't really,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   it's very hard to project forward.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   Yeah, to really understand.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   That's right.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.880]   Exactly right.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880]   So, you know,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   I deal with what I can
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   and where I can affect something.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   I tend not to worry about things I don't control
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   because at a certain point,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   you know,
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   there's no point.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   I mean,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   you have to decide what you're spending your time on.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   So, I think in practical terms,
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   I think we'll make Israel a formidable AI power.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   We understand the limitation of scale,
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   computing power,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   and other things.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.880]   But I think within those limits,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   I think we can make here this miracle
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   that we did in many other things.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   You know,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   we do more with less.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   I don't care if it's water,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   the production of water,
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   or the production of energy,
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   or the production of knowledge,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   or the production of cyber capabilities,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.880]   defense and other.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   We just do more with less.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   And I think in AI,
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   we're going to do a lot more
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   with relatively small
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   but highly gifted population.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   Very gifted.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   - So, taking a small tangent,
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   as we talked about offline,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.880]   you have a background in Taekwondo.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   - Yeah.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   We mentioned Elon Musk.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   I've trained with both.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.880]   Just as a quick question,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880]   who do you have,
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.880]   who are you betting on in a fight?
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.880]   - Well,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.880]   I refuse to answer that.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   I will say this.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.880]   - Such a politician you are.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880]   Here I'm a politician.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   I'm openly telling you,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.880]   then I'm dodging the question, okay?
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   But I'll say this.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   You know, I actually,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   I spent five years in our special forces
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   in the military,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   and we barely spent a minute on martial arts.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   I actually learned Taekwondo later
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   when I came to,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880]   it wasn't even at MIT.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   At MIT, I think I did karate,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.880]   but when I came to the UN,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   I had a martial arts expert
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880]   and he taught me Taekwondo,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   which was kind of interesting.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   Now, the question you really have to ask is,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   why did we learn martial arts
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   in this special elite unit?
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   And the answer is,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   there's no point.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   If you saw Indiana Jones,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880]   you know, there's no point.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   You just, you know,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   pull the trigger.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   That's simple.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   Now, I don't expect anyone
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   to pull the trigger on this combat,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   and I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   that doesn't happen.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   - I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   that doesn't happen.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   - I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880]   that doesn't happen.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   - I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   that doesn't happen.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   - I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880]   that doesn't happen.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880]   I mean, martial arts is this kind of,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   it's bigger than just combat.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's this kind of journey of humility,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   and it has,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   it's an art form.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   It truly is an art.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   But it's fascinating
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   that these two figures in tech
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   are facing each other.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   And I won't ask a question
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880]   of who you would face
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   and how you would do, but.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   - Well, I'm facing opponents
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   all the time.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   - All the time?
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   - Yeah, that's part of life.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   - But not of each.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   - Part of life is,
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   you know,
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   I'm not saying that
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   I'm not a professional,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   but I'm not a professional
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   in the martial arts world.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   - Yeah.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   - But I'm not saying
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   that you're not a professional
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   in the martial arts world.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   - But not of each.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   - You know, part of life,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   part of life is,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   - Not yet.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   - I'm not sure about that.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   - Are you announcing invites?
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   - No.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   - Okay.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   - No, no, no.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   Part of life is competition.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   You know,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   the only time competition ends
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.880]   is death.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   But, you know,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   political life,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   economic life,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   cultural life
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   is engaged continuously
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   in creativity and competition.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   And the problem I have with that,
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   as I mentioned earlier,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   just before we began the podcast,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.880]   is that,
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   you know,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   I'm not saying
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   that I'm not a professional.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   I'm not saying
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   that I'm not a professional.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   I'm not saying
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   that I'm not a professional.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   What I'm saying is,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   is that,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   at a certain point,
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   you want to put barriers to monopoly.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   And if you're
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   a really able competitor,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   you're gonna create a monopoly.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   That's what Peter Thiel says
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   is a natural course of things.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   It's what I learned
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   in basically
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   in the Boston Consulting Group.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   If you're a very able competitor,
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   you'll create scale advantages
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   that give you the ability
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   to lock out your competition.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   And as a prime minister,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   I want to assure
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   that there is competition
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   in the markets.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   You have to limit,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   limit this competitive power
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   at a certain point.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   And that becomes increasingly hard
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   in the world
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   where everything is intermixed.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   Where do you define market segments?
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.880]   Where do you define monopoly?
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   How do you do that?
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   That is very,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   that actually conceptually,
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   I find very challenging.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Because of all the dozens
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   of political,
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   of economic reforms
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   that I've made,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   the most difficult part
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   is the conceptual part.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.880]   Why?
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   Because once you have,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   you've ironed it out,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   you say,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   here's what I want to do,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   here's the right thing to do,
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   then you have a practical problem
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   of overcoming union resistance,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   political resistance,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   press calumny,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   opponents from this or that corner.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   That's a practical matter.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   But if you have it conceptually defined,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   you can move ahead
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   to reform economies
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   or reform education
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   or reform transportation.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   Fine.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   And the question of
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   the growing power
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   of large companies,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   big tech companies
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   to monopolize the markets
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   because they're better at it.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   They provide a service,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   they provide it at lower cost,
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.880]   at rapidly declining cost.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   Where do you stop?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   Where do you stop
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   monopoly power
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.880]   is a crucial question
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.880]   because it also becomes now
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   a political question.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   If you amass enormous amount
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   of economic power,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   which is information power,
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   that also monopolizes
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   the political process,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   which creates,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   these are real questions
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   that are not obvious.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   I don't have an obvious answer
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   because as I said,
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   as a 19th century democrat,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   these are questions
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   of the 21st century
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.880]   which people should begin to think.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   Do you have a solution to that?
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   The solution of monopoly
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   is growing arbitrarily,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   unstoppably in power.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   Economic power
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   and therefore in political power.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   I mean,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   some of that is very clear.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   I mean,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.880]   I think that's the question
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   that's very clear.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   I think that's the question
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.880]   that's very clear.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   I think that's the question
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   that's very clear.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   I think that's the question
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   that's very clear.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   I mean,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   some of that is regulation.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   Some of that is competition.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   You know where?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   To draw the line?
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   It's not breaking up AT&T,
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   you know,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   it's not that simple.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   Well,
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   I believe in the power
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   of competition
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   that there will always be
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   somebody that challenges
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   the big guys.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   Especially in the space of AI,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   the more open source movements
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   are taking hold,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   the more the little guy
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   can become the big guy.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   So you're saying
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   basically the regulatory,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   the regulatory is
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   the market.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   In large part,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   in most part.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   That's the hope.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   Maybe I'm a dreamer.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.880]   That's been in many ways
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   my policy up to now.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   Okay?
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   That the best regulator
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   is the market.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   The best regulator
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   in economic,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   in economic activity
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   is the market.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   And the best regulator
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   in political matters
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   is the political market.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   That's called elections.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   That's what,
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   that's what regulation
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   is.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   And the best regulator
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   in political matters
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   is the political market.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   That's called elections.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   That's what,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   that's what regulation
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   is.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   And the best regulator
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   in political matters
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   is the political market.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   That's what regulation is.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   You know,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   you have a lousy government
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   and people make
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   lousy decisions.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   Well,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   you don't need,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   you know,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   the wise men
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.880]   raised above the,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   you know,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   the,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   the masses
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.880]   to decide
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   what is good
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   and what is bad.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   Let the masses decide.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   Let them vote
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   every four years
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   or whatever.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   And they throw you up.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   By the way,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   it happened to me.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   There's life
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   after political death.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   There's actually political life.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   I was reelected
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   in the United States
