[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   "We should never, and I never, sit aside and say,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.900]   "Oh, they're just threatening to destroy us.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.960]   "They won't do it."
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.880]   If somebody threatens to eliminate you,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.400]   as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then,
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.520]   and people discounted it, well,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.080]   if somebody threatens to annihilate us,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.600]   take them seriously, and act to prevent it early on.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.920]   Don't let them have the means to do so,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.360]   because that may be too late.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.040]   - The following is a conversation
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.720]   with Benjamin Netanyahu,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.480]   Prime Minister of Israel,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   currently serving his sixth term in office.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   He's one of the most influential, powerful,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.560]   and controversial men in the world,
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.680]   leading a right-wing coalition government
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.040]   at the center of one of the most intense
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.560]   and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.200]   As we spoke, and as I speak now,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000]   large-scale protests are breaking out all over Israel
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.640]   over this government's proposed judicial reform
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.600]   that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960]   in a bold accumulation of power.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560]   Given the current intense political battles in Israel,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.440]   our previous intention to speak for three hours
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.800]   was adjusted to one hour for the time being,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.640]   but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.160]   I will also interview people who harshly disagree
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.400]   with the words spoken in this conversation.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.820]   I will speak with other world leaders,
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.320]   with religious leaders, with historians and activists,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040]   and with people who have lived and have suffered
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.440]   through the pain of war, destruction, and loss
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.440]   that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.520]   For this, I will travel anywhere, no matter how dangerous,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.400]   if there's any chance it may help add
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.080]   to understanding and love in the world.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.120]   I believe in the power of conversation, to do just this,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   to remind us of our common humanity.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120]   I know I'm underqualified and underskilled
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.920]   for these conversations, so I will often fall short,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.160]   and I will certainly get attacked, derided, and slandered,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.360]   but I will always turn the other cheek
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.920]   and use these attacks to learn, to improve,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.800]   and no matter what, never give in to cynicism.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.840]   This life, this world of ours,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560]   is too beautiful not to keep trying,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.260]   trying to do some good in whatever way each of us know how.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900]   I love you all.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.500]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.700]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.460]   in the description, and now, dear friends,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.520]   here's Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.340]   You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.380]   but you're also hated by many.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.820]   In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.380]   in the world, so if there's a young man or a young woman
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.300]   listening to this right now who have such hate
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.340]   in their heart, what can you say to them
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.900]   to one day turn that hate into love?
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.620]   - I disagree with the premise of your question.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.580]   I think I have enjoyed a very broad support
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.420]   around the world.
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.380]   There are certain corners in which we have
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.380]   this animosity that you describe,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.500]   and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.580]   and news organs and so on in the United States,
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.660]   but it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.500]   that I have.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   I just gave an interview on an Iranian channel,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.340]   16 million viewers.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.340]   I gave another one, I just did a little video
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.760]   a few years ago, 25 million viewers from Iran.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.420]   Certainly no hate there, I have to tell you.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.780]   Not from the regime, okay?
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.580]   And when I go around the world,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.140]   and I've been around the world,
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.100]   people want to hear what we have to say,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.900]   what I have to say as a leader of Israel
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.420]   whom they respect increasingly
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.540]   as a rising power in the world.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.700]   So I disagree with that.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.740]   And the most important thing that goes against
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.300]   what you said is the respect that we receive
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.220]   from the Arab world and the fact that we've made
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.580]   four historic peace agreements with Arab countries.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.180]   They made it with me, they didn't make it with anyone else.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.060]   And I respect them and they respect me.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.420]   And probably more to come.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.620]   So I think the premise is wrong, that's all.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.220]   - Well, there's a lot of love, yes.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.060]   A lot of leaders are collaborating, are--
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.020]   - Respect, I said, not love.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.380]   - Okay, all right, well, it's a spectrum.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.820]   But there is people who don't have good things
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   to say about Israel, who do have hate in their heart
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.220]   for Israel, and what can you say to those people?
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.780]   - Well, I think they don't know very much.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.780]   I think they're guided by a lot of ignorance.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.180]   They don't know about Israel, they don't know
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.860]   that Israel is a stellar democracy, that it happens
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.260]   to be one of the most advanced societies on the planet,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.220]   that what Israel develops helps humanity in every field,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.900]   in medicine, in agriculture, in the environment,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.900]   in telecoms, and talk about AI in a minute,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.660]   but changing the world for the better,
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.220]   and spreading this among six continents.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.380]   We've sent rescue teams more than any other country
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.420]   in the world, and we're 1/10 of 1% of the world's population.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.580]   But when there's an earthquake or a devastation
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.900]   in Haiti or in the Philippines, Israel is there.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.340]   When there's an earthquake, a devastating earthquake
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.460]   in Turkey, Turkey, Israel was there.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.700]   When there's something in Nepal, Israel is there,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.260]   and it's the second country, it's the second country
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.860]   after, in one case, India, or after, in another case,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.620]   the United States, Israel is there.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.000]   Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.900]   - So you're a student of history.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.140]   If I could just linger on that philosophical notion
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.420]   of hate, that part of human nature.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   If you look at World War II, what do you learn
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.940]   from human nature, from the rise of the Third Reich,
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.580]   and the rise of somebody like Hitler,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.300]   and the hate that permeates that?
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.140]   - Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.780]   bad things in the bud.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.060]   You have to, there's a Latin term that says,
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.940]   obsta principi, stop bad things when they're small.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.940]   And the deliberate hatred, the incitement of hatred
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.100]   against one community, it's demonization,
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.460]   delegitimization that goes with it,
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.060]   is a very dangerous thing.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.820]   And that happened in the case of the Jews.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.160]   What started with the Jews soon spread to all of humanity.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.700]   So what we've learned is that's what we should,
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.540]   we should never, and I never, set aside and say,
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.580]   oh, they're just threatening to destroy us.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.580]   They won't do it.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.500]   If somebody threatens to eliminate you,
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.020]   as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then,
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.060]   and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.060]   to annihilate us, take them seriously,
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.260]   and act to prevent it early on.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.540]   Don't let them have the means to do so,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.780]   because that may be too late.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.900]   - So in those threats, underlying that hatred,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.380]   how much of it is anti-Zionism,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.820]   and how much of it is anti-Semitism?
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.620]   - I don't distinguish between the two.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.880]   You can't say, well, I'm okay with Jews,
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.220]   but I just don't think there should be a Jewish state.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.020]   It's like saying, I'm not anti-American,
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.900]   I just don't think there should be an America.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.260]   That's basically what people are saying,
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.700]   vis-a-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.380]   When you say anti-Zionism, you're saying
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.100]   the Jewish people don't have a right
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.140]   to have a state of their own.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.140]   And that is a denial of a basic principle
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:08.220]   that I think completely unmasks what is involved here.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.000]   Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.700]   Those who oppose the Jewish people oppose the Jewish state.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.900]   - If we jump from human history
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.540]   to the current particular moment,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.660]   there's protests in Israel now
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.500]   about the proposed judicial reform
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.080]   that gives power to your government
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.980]   to override the Supreme Court.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.580]   So the critics say that this gives too much power to you,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.540]   virtually making you a dictator.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.920]   - Yeah, well, that's ridiculous.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.060]   The mere fact that you have so many demonstrations
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   and protests, some dictatorship, huh?
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.620]   There's a lot of democracy here,
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.180]   more rambunctious and more robust
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.460]   than just anywhere on the planet.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.940]   - Can you still man the case that this may give
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.020]   too much power to the coalition government,
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.060]   to the prime minister, not just to you,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.260]   but to those who follow?
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.540]   - No, I think that's complete hogwash
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.500]   because I think there's very few people
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.100]   who are demonstrating against this.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.460]   Quite a few, quite many don't have an idea
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.540]   what is being discussed.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.180]   They're basically being sloganized.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.800]   You can sloganize, you know something about,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.940]   not mass media right now, but the social network.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.600]   You can basically feed deliberately
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.520]   with big data and big money.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.980]   You can just feed slogans and get into people's minds.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.260]   I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.220]   because you can tell me more about that.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.180]   And you can create mass mobilization
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.300]   based on these absurd slogans.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.580]   So here's where I come from and what we're doing,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.420]   what we're trying to do and what we've changed
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.140]   in what we're trying to do.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.280]   I'm a 19th century Democrat in my,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.180]   small D, yes, in my views.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.220]   That is, I ask the question, what is democracy?
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.020]   Okay, so democracy is the will of the majority
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.620]   and the protection of the rights of,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.140]   they call it the rights of the minority,
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.500]   but I say the rights of the individual, okay?
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.540]   So how do you balance the two, okay?
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.820]   How do you get those, how do you avoid mobocracy, okay?
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.260]   And how do you avoid dictatorship, the opposite side?
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.980]   The way you avoid it is something
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.700]   that was built essentially by British philosophers
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.920]   and French philosophers, but was encapsulated
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.340]   by the founding fathers of the United States.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.700]   You create a balance between the three branches
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.620]   of government, okay?
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.980]   The legislative, the executive and the judiciary.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.940]   And this balance is what assures the balance
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.540]   between majority rights and individual rights.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.620]   And you have to balance all of them, okay?
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.620]   That balance was maintained in Israel in its first 50 years
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.620]   and was gradually overtaken and basically broken
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.480]   by the most activist judicial court on the planet.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.320]   That's what happened here.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.920]   And gradually over the last two, three decades,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.600]   the court arrogated for itself the powers
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.680]   of the parliament and the executive.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.480]   So we're trying to bring it back into line.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.960]   Bringing it back into line into what is common
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.720]   in all parliamentary democracies and in the United States
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.440]   doesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.460]   and bringing it to the other side.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.560]   We want checks and balances, not unrivaled power.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.880]   Just as we said, we want an independent judiciary,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.360]   but not an all powerful judiciary.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.800]   That balance does not mean bringing it back into line
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.840]   doesn't mean that you can have the parliament,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.000]   our Knesset override any decision
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   that the Supreme Court does.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.080]   So I pretty much early on said
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   after the judicial reform was introduced,
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.260]   get rid of the idea of a sweeping override clause
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.280]   that would have with 61 votes, that's majority of one,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.620]   you can just nullify any Supreme Court decision.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.000]   So let's move it back into the center.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.440]   So that's gone.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.200]   And most of the criticism on the judicial reform
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.000]   was based on an unlimited override clause,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   which I've said is simply not gonna happen.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   People are discussing something that already
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   for six months does not exist.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   The second point that we received criticism on
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.140]   was the structure of how do you choose
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.380]   Supreme Court judges?
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.020]   Okay, how do you choose them?
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.020]   And the critics of the reform are saying that the idea
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.700]   that elected officials choose Supreme Court judges
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.500]   is the end of democracy.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.900]   If that's the case, the United States is not a democracy,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.620]   neither is France and other are just, I don't know,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.980]   just about every democracy on the planet.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.620]   So there is a view here that you can't have
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.360]   the sordid hands of elected officials
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.320]   involved in the choosing of judges.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.700]   And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went so far
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.700]   that effectively the sitting judges have an effective veto
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.780]   on choosing judges, which means that this is
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.040]   a self-selecting court that just perpetrates itself.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   And we wanna correct that.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.960]   Again, wanna correct it in a balanced way.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.900]   And that's basically what we're trying to do.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.600]   So I think there's a lot of misinformation about that.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.100]   We're trying to bring Israeli democracy
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.080]   to where it was in its first 50 years.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.160]   And it was a stellar democracy.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.000]   It still is.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.360]   Israel is a democracy, will remain a democracy,
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.960]   a vibrant democracy.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.240]   And believe me, the fact that people are arguing
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.920]   and demonstrating in the streets and protesting
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.720]   is just, is the best proof of that.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.920]   And that's how it'll remain.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.520]   - We spoke about tech companies offline.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.720]   There's a lot of tech companies nervous
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.440]   about this judicial reform.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.360]   Can you speak to why large and small companies
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.280]   have a future in Israel?
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.600]   - Because Israel is a free market economy.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.720]   I had something to do with that.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.160]   I introduced dozens and dozens of free market reforms
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.720]   that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.960]   to within a very short time to $54,000.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.600]   That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   And we've overtaken in that Japan, France, Britain, Germany.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.680]   How did that happen?
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.320]   Because we unleashed the genius that we have
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.280]   and the initiative and the entrepreneurship
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.640]   that is latent in our population.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.240]   And to do that, we had to create free markets.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.560]   So we created that.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.320]   So Israel has one of the most vibrant free market economies
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.400]   in the world.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.040]   And the second thing we have is a permanent investment
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.120]   in conceptual products,
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   because we have a permanent investment in the military
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.560]   and our security services,
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.360]   creating basically knowledge workers
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.320]   who then become knowledge entrepreneurs.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.200]   And so we create this structure
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.580]   and that's not gonna go away.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.480]   There's been a decline in investments
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.320]   in high tech globally.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.040]   I think that's driven by many factors,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.360]   but the most important one is the interest rate,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.080]   which I think it'll fluctuate up and down.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.400]   But Israel will remain a very attractive country
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.640]   because it produces so many, so many knowledge workers
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.080]   in a knowledge-based economy.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.800]   And it's changing so rapidly.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.960]   The world is changing.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.640]   You're looking for the places that have innovation.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.480]   The future belongs to those who innovate.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.320]   Israel is the preeminent innovation nation.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.680]   It has few competitors.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.200]   And I would say, all right,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   where do you have this close cross-disciplinary fermentation
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.440]   of various skills and areas?
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.520]   I would say it's in Israel.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.340]   I'll tell you why.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.280]   We used to be just telecoms
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.560]   because people went out of the military intelligence,
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.600]   our NSA, but that's been now broad-based.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.360]   So you find it in medicine, you find it in biology,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.680]   you find it in agri-tech, you find it everywhere.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.640]   Everything is becoming technologized.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.400]   And in Israel, everybody is dealing in everything.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.040]   And that's a potent reservoir of talent
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.560]   that the world is not gonna pass up.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.680]   And in fact, it's coming to us.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.080]   We just had Nvidia coming here
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.920]   and they decided to build a supercomputer in Israel.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.040]   Wonder why.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   We've had Intel coming here
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   and deciding now to invest $25 billion just now
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.360]   in a new plant in Israel.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.560]   I wonder why.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.480]   I don't wonder why.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.560]   They know why.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.440]   Because the talent is here and the freedom is here.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.600]   And it will remain so.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.320]   - So you had a conversation about AI
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.720]   with Sam Altman of OpenAI and with Elon Musk.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.760]   What was the content of that conversation?
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   What's your vision for sort of this very highest of tech,
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.000]   which is artificial intelligence?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.400]   - Well, first of all, I have a high regard
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.560]   for the people I talk to, okay?
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.480]   And I understand that they understand things
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.320]   I don't understand.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.960]   And I don't pretend to understand everything,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.000]   but I do understand one thing.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I understand that AI is developing at a geometric rate.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.200]   And mostly in political life and in life in general,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.600]   people don't have an intuitive grasp of geometric growth.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.200]   You understand things basically in linear increments.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.240]   And the idea that you're coming up a ski slope
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.320]   is very foreign to people.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.360]   So they don't understand it.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   And they're naturally also sort of taken aback by it.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.520]   Because what do you do?
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.920]   So I think there's several conclusions
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.400]   from my conversations with them
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.240]   and from my other observations
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   that I've been talking about for many years.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.080]   I'm talking about the need to do this.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.720]   Well, the first thing is this.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.360]   There is no possibility of not entering AI with full force.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.640]   Secondly, there is a need for regulation.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.520]   Third, it's not clear there'll be global regulation.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.640]   Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.640]   I certainly cannot say that.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.920]   Now you might say, does it come to control us?
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.000]   Okay, that's a question.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.240]   Does it come to control us?
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.840]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.400]   I think that as one observation
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:44.440]   that I had from these conversations
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.280]   is if it does come to control us,
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.680]   that's probably the only chance
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.160]   of having universal regulation
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   because I don't see anyone deciding to avoid the race
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:03.560]   and cooperate unless you have that threat.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.280]   Doesn't mean you can't regulate AI within countries
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.720]   even without that understanding.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.960]   But it does mean that there's a limit to regulation
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.640]   because every country will wanna make sure
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.960]   that it doesn't give up competitive advantage
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.920]   if there is no universal regulation.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.200]   I think that right now, just as 10 years ago,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.400]   I read a novel.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.280]   I don't read novels,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.360]   but I was forced to read one by a scientific advisor.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.320]   I read history, I read about economics,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.920]   I read about technology, I just don't read novels.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.680]   And this time, follow Churchill.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.120]   He said, "Fact is better than fiction."
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.600]   Well, this fiction would become fact.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.680]   And it was a book, it was a novel
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   about a Chinese-American future cyber war.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   And I read the book in one sitting,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   called in a team of experts and I said,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.080]   "All right, let's turn Israel
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.160]   "into one of the world's five cyber powers
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.320]   "and let's do it very quickly."
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.800]   And we did actually, we did exactly that.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.720]   I think AI is bigger than that and related to that
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.280]   because it'll affect, well, cyber affects everything,
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.080]   but AI will affect it even more fundamentally.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.760]   And the joining of the two could be very powerful.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.800]   So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.480]   for security reasons and we're doing it.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.600]   But I think what about our databases
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   that are already very robust
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.280]   on the medical records of 98% of our population?
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.720]   Why don't we stick a genetic database on that?
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.960]   Why don't we do other things
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.800]   that could bring magical,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.880]   what seem are seemingly magical cures
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.520]   and drugs and medical instruments for that?
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.720]   That's one possibility.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.680]   We have it in, as I said, in every single field.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.000]   The conclusion is this, we have to move on AI.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.600]   We are moving on AI just as we moved on cyber.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.880]   And I think Israel will be one of the leading,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.600]   one of the leading AI powers in the world.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.200]   The questions I don't have an answer to is,
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.880]   where does it go?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.960]   How much does it eat, chew up on jobs?
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.600]   There's an assumption that I'm not sure is true
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   that all previous, the two big previous revolutions
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.400]   in the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.720]   and the industrial revolution,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   definitely produce more jobs than they consumed.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.360]   Okay, that is not obvious to me at all.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.120]   I mean, I can see new jobs creating,
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.180]   and yes, I have that comforting statement,
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.720]   but it's not quite true.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.200]   Because I think on balance,
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   they'll probably consume more jobs,
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.960]   many more jobs than they'll create.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.200]   - At least in the short term.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.480]   And we don't know about the long term.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.840]   - No, I don't know about the long term,
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.600]   but I used to have the comfort being a free market guy,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.680]   always said, you know, we're gonna produce more jobs
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   than, you know, by, I don't know,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.520]   limiting certain government jobs.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.240]   We're actually putting out in the market,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.720]   we'll create more jobs, which obviously happened.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.560]   You know, we had one telecom company,
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.520]   a government company, when I said,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.080]   we're going to, you know, we're going to create competition.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.740]   They said, you're gonna run us out,
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.560]   we're not gonna have more workers.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.600]   Yeah, they had 13,000 workers, they went down to seven,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.680]   but we create another 40,000 in the other companies.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.400]   So that was a comforting thought.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   I always knew that was true, okay?
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.600]   Not only that, I also knew that wealth would spread
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.320]   by opening up the markets completely opposite
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.400]   to the socialist and semi socialist creed
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.080]   that they had here.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.000]   They said, you're gonna make the rich richer
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.680]   and the poor, poor, no, and made everyone richer.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.700]   And actually, the people who entered the job market
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.880]   because of the reforms we did actually became a lot richer
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.920]   on the lower ladders of the socioeconomic measure.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.320]   But here's the point.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   I don't know, I don't know that we will not have
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.920]   what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.360]   So you'll have the end of scarcity,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.260]   you'll have enormous productivity.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.480]   You know, very few people are producing
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.460]   enormous added value.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.960]   You're gonna have to tax that to pass it to the others, okay?
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.280]   You're gonna have to do that, that's a political question.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   I'm not sure how we answer that.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.400]   What if you tax and somebody else doesn't tax,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.580]   you're gonna get everybody to go there.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.480]   That's an issue, an international issue
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.200]   that we constantly have to deal with.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.980]   And the second question you have is,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.920]   suppose you solve that problem and you deliver money, okay,
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:57.960]   to those who are not involved in the AI economy.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.200]   What do they do?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   The first question you ask somebody
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.840]   whom you just met after the polite exchanges is,
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.080]   what do you do, right?
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.400]   Well, people define themselves by their profession.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.760]   And it's gonna be difficult if you don't have a profession.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.320]   And people will spend more time self-searching,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   more time in the arts, more time in leisure,
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.520]   I understand that.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.440]   If I have to bet, it will annihilate many more jobs
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.400]   than it will create and it will force a structural change
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.480]   in our economics, in our economic models
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.400]   and in our politics.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.800]   And I'm not sure where it's gonna go.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.140]   - And that's something we have to respond to
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.400]   at the nation level and just as a human civilization.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.940]   Both the threat of AI to just us as a human species
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.120]   and then the effect on the jobs
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.240]   and like you said, cyber security.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.080]   - And what do you think?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.000]   You think we're gonna lose control?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.220]   - No, first of all, I do believe maybe naively
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.720]   that it will create more jobs than it takes.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.280]   - Write that down and we'll check it.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.120]   - It's on record.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   - And you know, we don't say we'll check it
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.080]   after our lifetime.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.240]   No, we'll see it in a few years.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.780]   - We'll see it in a few years.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.560]   I'm really concerned about cyber security
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.400]   and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.160]   And in terms of existential threats,
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.360]   I think there'll be so much threats
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.540]   that aren't existential along the way
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.940]   that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.820]   versus AI taking complete control
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.900]   and becoming sort of superseding the human species.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.880]   Although that is something you should consider seriously
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.260]   because of the exponential growth of its capability.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.040]   - It's exactly the exponential growth
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.460]   which we understand is before us,
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.500]   but we don't really, it's very hard to project forward.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.620]   - To really understand.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.420]   - That's right, exactly right.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.820]   So, you know, I deal with what I can
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.740]   and where I can affect something.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.580]   I tend not to worry about things I don't control
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.140]   because at a certain point, you know, there's no point.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.400]   I mean, you have to decide what you're spending your time on.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.820]   So I think in practical terms,
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.820]   I think we'll make Israel a formidable AI power.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.220]   We understand the limitation of scale,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.520]   computing power and other things.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.080]   But I think within those limits,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.300]   I think we can make here this miracle
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.280]   that we did in many other things.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.460]   You know, we do more with less.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.500]   I don't care if it's water, the production of water
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.700]   or the production of energy or the production of knowledge
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.320]   or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.220]   We just do more with less.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.380]   And I think in AI, we're gonna do a lot more
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.020]   with relatively small but highly gifted population,
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.740]   very gifted.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.940]   - So taking a small tangent, as we talked about offline,
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.380]   you have a background in Taekwondo.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.220]   - Oh yeah.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.900]   - Yeah, we mentioned Elon Musk.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.580]   I've trained with both.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.820]   Just as a quick question, who are you betting on in a fight?
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.660]   - Well, I refuse to answer that.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.500]   I will say this.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.740]   - Such a politician you are.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.580]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.500]   Here I'm a politician.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.660]   I'm openly telling you then I'm dodging the question, okay?
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.400]   But I'll say this.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.380]   You know, I actually,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.780]   I spent five years in our special forces in the military
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.020]   and we barely spent a minute on martial arts.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.060]   I actually learned Taekwondo later when I came to,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.220]   it wasn't even at MIT.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.640]   At MIT, I think I did karate.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.580]   But when I came to the UN, I had a martial arts expert
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.000]   and he taught me Taekwondo, which was kind of interesting.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.300]   Now, the question you really have to ask is,
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.500]   why did we learn martial arts
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.660]   in this special elite unit?
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.420]   And the answer is, there's no point.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.860]   If you saw Indiana Jones, there's no point.
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.620]   You just pull the trigger.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.060]   That's simple.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.740]   Now, I don't expect anyone to pull the trigger
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.300]   on this combat and I'm sure you'll make sure
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   that doesn't happen.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.580]   - Yeah, I mean, martial arts is this kind of,
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.900]   it's bigger than just combat.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.820]   It's this kind of journey of humility
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.540]   and it's an art form, it truly is an art.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.980]   But it's fascinating that these two figures in tech
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.460]   are facing each other.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.500]   And I won't ask a question of who you would face
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.180]   and how you would do, but--
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.220]   - Well, I'm facing opponents all the time.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.060]   - All the time?
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.220]   - Yeah, that's part of life.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.420]   - But not a huge--
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.260]   - Part of life is--
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.100]   - Not yet.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.920]   - I'm not sure about that.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.500]   - Are you announcing invites?
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.780]   - No, no, no, part of life is competition.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.700]   The only time competition ends is death.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.820]   But political life, economic life,
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.700]   cultural life is engaged continuously
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.380]   in creativity and competition.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.860]   The problem I have with that, as I mentioned earlier
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.980]   just before we began the podcast,
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.960]   is that at a certain point,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.580]   you want to put barriers to monopoly.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.180]   And if you're a really able competitor,
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.640]   you're gonna create a monopoly.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.540]   That's what Peter Thiel says is a natural course of things.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.180]   It's what I learned basically
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.300]   in the Boston Consulting Group.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.400]   If you're a very able competitor,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.740]   you'll create scale advantages that give you
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.940]   the ability to lock out your competition.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.300]   And as a prime minister, I want to assure
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.900]   that there is competition in the market,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.860]   so you have to limit this competitive power
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.700]   at a certain point.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.420]   And that becomes increasingly hard
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.020]   in a world where everything is intermixed.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.500]   Where do you define market segments?
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.740]   Where do you define monopoly?
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.580]   How do you do that?
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.580]   That is very, that actually conceptually
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.700]   I find very challenging.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.260]   Because of all the dozens of political,
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.860]   of economic reforms that I've made,
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.820]   the most difficult part is the conceptual part.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.900]   Once you've ironed it out, you say,
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.580]   "Here's what I want to do, here's the right thing to do,"
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.060]   then you have a practical problem
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.260]   of overcoming union resistance, political resistance,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:24.260]   press calumny, opponents from this or that corner.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.020]   That's a practical matter.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.940]   But if you have it conceptually defined,
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.460]   you can move ahead to reform economies
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   or reform education or reform transportation, fine.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.580]   And the question of the growing power
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.220]   of large companies, big tech companies
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.180]   to monopolize the markets because they're better at it,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.100]   they provide a service, they provide it at lower cost,
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.020]   rapidly declining cost, where do you stop?
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.580]   Where do you stop in a monopoly power is a crucial question
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.660]   because it also becomes now a political question.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.660]   If you amass enormous amount of economic power,
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.020]   which is information power,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.220]   that also monopolizes the political process,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.660]   which creates, these are real questions
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.660]   that are not obvious, I don't have an obvious answer.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.620]   Because as I said, as a 19th century Democrat,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.580]   these are questions of the 21st century
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.380]   which people should begin to think.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.620]   Do you have a solution to that?
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.100]   - The solution of monopolies growing arbitrarily,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.220]   unstoppably in power.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.980]   - In economic power and therefore in political power.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.740]   - I mean, some of that is regulation,
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.840]   some of that is competition.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.140]   - You know where?
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.500]   - To draw the line?
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.900]   It's not breaking up AT&T, it's not that simple.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.060]   - Well, I believe in the power of competition
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.580]   that there will always be somebody
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.660]   that challenges the big guys,
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.140]   especially in the space of AI,
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.580]   the more open source movements are taking hold,
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.580]   the more the little guy can become the big guy.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.980]   - So you're saying basically the regulatory instrument
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.820]   is the market?
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.060]   - In large part, in most part, that's the hope.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.340]   - Maybe I'm a dreamer.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.340]   - That's been in many ways my policy up to now.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.940]   That the best regulator is the market,
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.940]   the best regulator in economic activity is the market,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.500]   and the best regulator in political matters
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.820]   is the political market, that's called elections.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.620]   That's what regulates, you have a lousy government
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.980]   and people make lousy decisions.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   Well, you don't need the wise men raised above the masses
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.620]   to decide what is good and what is bad,
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.460]   let the masses decide, let them vote every four years
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.420]   or whatever, and they throw you up.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   By the way, it happened to me,
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.180]   there's life after political death.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.300]   There's actually political life,
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.020]   I was reelected five or six times,
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.740]   and this is my sixth term.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.940]   So I believe in that, I'm not sure.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.580]   I'm not sure that in economic matters,
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:14.260]   in the geometric growth of tech companies,
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.060]   that you'll always have the little guy,
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.020]   the nimble mammal that will come out
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.260]   and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs,
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.100]   which is essentially what you said.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.460]   - Yeah, I wouldn't count out the little guy.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.260]   - You wouldn't count out the little guy.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.460]   Well, I hope you're right.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.940]   (laughing)
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.180]   - Well, let me ask you about this market of politics.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.500]   So you have served six terms as prime minister
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.740]   over 15 years in power.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.780]   Let me ask you again, human nature.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.980]   Do you worry about the corrupting nature of power
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.100]   on you as a leader, on you as a man?
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.380]   - Not at all, because I think that the,
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.220]   again, the thing that drives me is not,
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.420]   is nothing but the mission that I took to assure
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:05.420]   the survival and thriving of the state, the Jewish state.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.560]   That is, its economic prosperity,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.640]   but its security and its ability to achieve peace
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.640]   with our neighbors, and I'm committed to it.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.960]   I think there's still, there are many things
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.160]   that have been done.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.880]   There are a few big things that I can still do,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.440]   but it doesn't only depend on my sense of mission.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.160]   It depends on the market, as we say.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   It depends really on the will of the Israeli voters,
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.880]   and the Israeli voters have decided to vote for me
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.640]   again and again, even though I wield no power in the press.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   No power in many quarters here, and so on.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.960]   Nothing, I mean, I am probably, I'm going to be very soon
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.520]   the longest serving prime minister in the last half century
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.720]   in the Western democracies, but that's not because
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.680]   I amassed great political power in any of the institutions.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:01.680]   I remember I had a conversation with Silvio Berlusconi,
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.900]   who recently died, and he said to me about,
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.900]   I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   He said, "So, Bibi, how many of Israel's television stations
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:21.260]   "do you have?"
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.600]   And I said, "None."
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.440]   He said, "Do you have none?"
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.340]   "I have two." - Do you have?
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.180]   - Do you have?
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.380]   I said, "None, I have two."
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.380]   He said, "No, no, but what, you mean you don't have any
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.260]   "that you control?"
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.580]   I said, "Not only do I have none that I control,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.860]   "they're all against me."
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.940]   So he says, "So how do you win elections?"
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.220]   And with both hands tied behind your back,
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.300]   and I said, "The hard way."
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.900]   That's why I have the largest party,
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.140]   but I don't have many more seats than I would have
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.500]   if I had a sympathetic voice in the media.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.980]   And Israel is, until recently, was dominated completely
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.740]   by one side of the political spectrum
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.740]   that often vilified me, not me, because they viewed me
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.380]   as representing basically the conservative voices
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.660]   in Israel that are majority.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:14.660]   So the idea that I'm an omnipotent, authoritarian dictator
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.260]   is ridiculous.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.900]   I am, I would say I'm not merely a champion
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.380]   of democracy and democratization.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:29.940]   I believe ultimately the decision is with the voters,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.460]   and the voters, even though they've had,
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.620]   you know, they have constant, constant press attacks,
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.340]   they have chosen to put me back in.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.860]   So I don't believe in this thing of amassing
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.260]   the corrupting power.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.260]   If you don't have elections, if you don't have,
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:51.100]   if you control the means of influencing the voters,
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.180]   I'd understand what you're saying,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.340]   but in my case, it's the exact opposite.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.620]   I have to constantly go in elections,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.220]   constantly, you know, with the disadvantage
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.220]   that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:09.540]   against me, but it's fine, and I keep on winning.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.060]   So I don't know what you're talking,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.460]   I would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere,
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.300]   not here.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.460]   - Well, you have been involved in several corruption cases.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.500]   How much corruption is there in Israel,
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.180]   and how do you fight it in your own party and in Israel?
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.460]   - Well, you should ask a different question.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.700]   What's happened to these cases?
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.180]   These cases have basically are collapsing,
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.180]   and before our eyes, there was recently an event
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:40.540]   in which the judges, the three judges in my case,
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.660]   called in the prosecution and said,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.580]   "You know, your flagship, the bribery charge,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.420]   "so-called bribery charge, you know, is gone.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.540]   "It doesn't exist."
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.540]   Before a single defense witness was called,
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.700]   and it sort of tells you that this thing is evaporating.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.180]   It's quite astounding.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.180]   Even that, I have to say, was covered
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.700]   even by the mainstream press in Israel
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.940]   because it's such an earthquake.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.620]   So, you know, a lot of these charges are, not a lot,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.380]   these charges will prove to be nothing.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.460]   I always said, "Listen, I stand before the legal process.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.460]   "I don't claim that I'm exempt from it in any way.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.860]   "On the contrary, I think the truth will come out,
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.900]   "and it's coming out."
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.820]   We see that not only that, but with other things.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.300]   So I think it's kind of instructive
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.460]   that no politician has been more vilified,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.460]   no one has been put to such a, you know,
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.620]   what is it, about a quarter of a billion shekels
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.620]   were used to scrutinize me, scour my bank accounts,
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.860]   sending people to the Philippines and to Mexico
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   and to Europe and to America,
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.940]   and looking at everybody using spyware,
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.980]   the most advanced spyware on the planet
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.740]   against my associates, blackmailing witnesses,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   telling them, you know, "Think about your family,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.280]   "think about your wife, you know,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.660]   "you better tell us what you want."
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.100]   All that is coming out in the trial.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   So I would say that most people now are not asking,
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.220]   are no longer asking, including my opponents,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.180]   it's sort of trickling in as the stuff comes out.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.580]   People are not saying, "What did Netanyahu do?"
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.020]   Because he apparently did nothing.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.500]   What was done to him is something that people ask.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.460]   What was done to him, what was done to our democracy?
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.700]   What was done in the attempt to put down somebody
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.900]   who keeps winning elections
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.060]   despite the handicaps that I described?
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.460]   Maybe we can, maybe we can nail him by framing him.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.620]   And the one thing I can say about this court trial
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.820]   is that things are coming out, and that's very good.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.580]   Just objective things are coming out, changing the picture.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.300]   So I would say the attempt to brand me as corrupt
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.540]   is falling on its face,
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.700]   but the thing that is being uncovered in the trial,
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   such as the use, the use of spyware on a politician,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.700]   a politician's surroundings,
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.700]   to try to shake them down in investigations,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.260]   put them in flea-ridden cells for 21 days,
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   invite their 84-year-old mother to investigations
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.220]   without cause, bringing in their mistresses
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.980]   in the corridor, shaking them down,
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.780]   that's what people are asking.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.140]   That corruption is what they want corrected.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.060]   (inhales)
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.820]   - What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.580]   of Israelis and Palestinians?
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.860]   Let's talk about the big question of peace
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.940]   in this part of the world.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.660]   - Well, I think the reason you have the persistence
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.100]   of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.020]   which goes back about a century,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.580]   is the persistent Palestinian refusal
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.180]   to recognize a Jewish state,
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.380]   a nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   That's why they opposed the establishment
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.860]   of the state of Israel before we had a state,
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:23.100]   and that's why they've opposed it after we had a state.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.500]   They opposed it when we were,
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.580]   we didn't have Judea and Samaria,
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.500]   the West Bank in our heads, and Gaza,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.060]   and they opposed it after we have it.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.940]   Doesn't make a difference.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.180]   It's basically their persistent refusal
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.260]   to recognize a Jewish state in any boundaries,
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.740]   and I think their tragedy is that they've been commandeered
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.020]   for a century by leadership that refused to compromise
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:48.020]   with the idea of Zionism, namely that the Jews deserve
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.620]   a state in this part of the world.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.980]   The territorial dispute is something else.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.860]   You have a territorial dispute if you say,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.660]   "Okay, you're living on this side,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.620]   "we're living on that side,
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.060]   "let's decide where the border is," and so on.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.900]   That's not what the argument is.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.700]   The Palestinian society, which is itself
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.220]   fragmented, but all the factions agree
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.220]   there shouldn't be a Jewish state anywhere, okay?
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.500]   They just disagree between Hamas that says,
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.840]   "Oh, well, you should have it,
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.920]   "we should get rid of it with terror,"
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.900]   and the others who say, "No, we should also use
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.380]   "political means to dissolve it."
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.780]   So that is the problem.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.020]   - So even as part of a two-state solution,
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.060]   they're still against the idea?
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.260]   - Well, they don't want a state next to Israel.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.580]   They want a state instead of Israel,
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.980]   and they say, "If we get a state,
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.780]   "we'll use it as a springboard
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.660]   "to destroy the smaller Israeli state,"
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.220]   which is what happened when Israel unilaterally
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.300]   walked out of Gaza and effectively established
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.880]   a Hamas state there.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.180]   They didn't say, "Oh, good, now we have
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.740]   "our own territory, our own state,
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.880]   "Israel is no longer there, let's build peace,
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.320]   "let's build economic projects,
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.600]   "let's enfranchise our people."
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.040]   No, they turned it into a basically into a terror bastion
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.560]   from which they fired 10,000 rockets into Israel.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.940]   When Israel left Lebanon,
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.080]   because we had terrorist attacks from there,
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.320]   then we had Lebanon taken over by Hezbollah,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.480]   a terrorist organization that seeks to destroy Israel.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.760]   And therefore, every time we just walked out,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.520]   what we got was not peace.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.880]   We didn't give territory for peace,
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.220]   we got territory for terror.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.280]   That's what we had.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.320]   And that's what would happen as long as
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.000]   the reigning ideology says,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.260]   "We don't want Israel in any border."
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.480]   So the idea of two states assumes that you'd have
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.240]   on the other side, a state that wants to live in peace
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.360]   and not one that will be overtaken by Iran
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.120]   and its proxies in two seconds
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.200]   and become a base to destroy Israel.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.720]   And therefore, I think that most Israelis today,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.680]   if you ask them,
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.360]   they'd say, "It's not gonna work in that concept.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.200]   "So what do you do?
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.040]   "What do you do with the Palestinians?"
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.520]   Okay, they're still there.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.500]   And I don't, unlike them, I don't want to throw them out.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.000]   They're gonna be living here and we're gonna be living here
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.600]   in an area which is, by the way, just to understand,
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:22.320]   the area, the entire area of so-called West Bank
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.680]   and Israel is the width of the Washington Beltway,
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.600]   more or less, just a little more, not much more.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.800]   You can't really divide it up.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.040]   You can't say, "Well, you're gonna fly in."
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.720]   Who controls the airspace?
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.840]   Well, it takes you about two and a half minutes
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   to cross it with a regular, you know, 747, okay?
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:46.480]   With a fighter plane, it takes you a minute and a half.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.960]   Okay, so you're not,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.600]   how are you gonna divide the airspace?
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.640]   Well, you're not gonna divide it.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.720]   Israel's gonna control that airspace
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.560]   and the electromagnetic space and so on.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.120]   So security has to be in the hands of Israel.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.000]   My view of how you solve this problem
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.120]   is that it is a simple principle.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.000]   The Palestinians should have all the powers
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.040]   to govern themselves and none of the powers
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.320]   to threaten Israel, which basically means
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.080]   that the responsibility for overall security
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.320]   remains with Israel.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.640]   And from a practical point of view,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.520]   we've seen that every time that Israel leaves a territory
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.080]   and takes its security forces out of an area,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.360]   it immediately is overtaken by Hamas or Hezbollah
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.880]   or jihadists who basically are committed
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.140]   to the destruction of Israel and also bring misery
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.400]   to the Palestinians or Arab subjects.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.600]   So I think that that principle
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.200]   is less than perfect sovereignty
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.840]   because you're taking a certain amount of powers,
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.720]   sovereign powers, especially security, away.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.080]   But I think it's the only practical solution.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.240]   So people say, ah, but it's not a perfect state.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.040]   I say, okay, call it what you will, call it, you know,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.280]   I don't know, limited sovereignty, call it autonomy plus,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.200]   call it whatever you wanna call it.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.320]   But that's the reality.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.360]   And right now, if you ask Israelis
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   across the political spectrum,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.240]   except the very hard left, most Israelis agree with that.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.720]   They don't really debate it.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.920]   - So a two-state solution where Israel controls
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.800]   the security of the entire region?
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.240]   - We don't call it quite that.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.260]   I mean, there are different names,
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.760]   but the idea is, yes, Israel controls security
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.040]   and it's the entire area, it's this tiny area
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.720]   between the Jordan River and the sea.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.640]   I mean, it's like, you know, you can walk it
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.080]   in not one afternoon, if you're really fit,
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   you can do it in a day.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.480]   Less than a day, I did.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   - So the expansion of settlements in the West Bank
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.320]   has been a top priority for this new government.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.680]   People, many harshly criticize this
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   as contributing to escalating the Israel-Palestine tensions.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.500]   Can you understand that perspective,
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.380]   that this expansion of settlements is not good
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.700]   for this two-state solution?
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.180]   - Yeah, I can understand what they're saying
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.340]   and they don't understand why they're wrong.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.300]   First, most Israelis who live in Judea, Samaria,
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.060]   live in urban blocks, and that accounts
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.020]   for about 90% of the population, okay?
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.780]   And everybody recognizes that those urban blocks
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.080]   are gonna be part of Israel in any future arrangement.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.440]   So they're really arguing about something
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.060]   that has already been decided and agreed upon, really,
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.840]   by Americans, even by Arabs, many Arabs.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.760]   They don't think that Israel's gonna dismantle these blocks.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.860]   You know, you look outside the window here,
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.980]   and within about a kilometer, a mile from here,
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.940]   is you have Jerusalem, half of Jerusalem grew naturally
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.100]   beyond the old 1967 border.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.540]   So you're not gonna dismantle half of Jerusalem,
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.220]   that's not gonna happen.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.580]   And most people don't expect that.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   Then you have the other 10% scattered in tiny,
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.940]   you know, small communities.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.380]   And people say, "Well, you're gonna have to take them out."
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.660]   Why, why?
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.780]   Remember that in pre-1967 Israel,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.140]   we have over a million and a half Arabs here.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.300]   We don't say, "Oh, Israel has to be ethically cleansed
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.480]   "from Arabs in order to have, from its Arab citizens,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.740]   "in order to have peace."
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.660]   Of course not.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.860]   Jews can live among Arabs, and Arabs can live among Jews.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.580]   And what is being advanced by those people who say
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.540]   that we can't live in our ancestral homeland,
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.500]   in these disputed areas, nobody says
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.600]   that this is Palestinian areas,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.340]   and nobody says that these are Israeli areas.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.640]   We claim them, they claim them,
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.300]   we've only been attached to this land
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.740]   for, oh, 3,500 years.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.360]   But, you know, but it's a dispute, I agree.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.300]   But I don't agree that we should throw out the Arabs,
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.900]   and I don't think that they should throw out the Jews.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.980]   And if somebody said to you, "The only way we're gonna have
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.420]   "peace with Israel is to have an ethnically cleansed
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.700]   "Palestinian entity," you know, that's outrageous.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.940]   If you said, "The only way," you know,
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.420]   "you shouldn't have Jews living in, I don't know,
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.900]   "in suburbs of London or New York and so on,"
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.660]   I don't think that will play too well.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.500]   The world is actually advancing a solution
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.820]   that says that Jews cannot live among Arabs
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.180]   and Arabs cannot live among Jews.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.380]   I don't think that's the right way to do it.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.940]   And I think there's a solution out there,
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.540]   but I don't think we're gonna get to it,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   which is less than perfect sovereignty,
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.420]   which involves Israeli security,
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.060]   maintained for the entire territory by Israel,
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.580]   which involves not rooting out anybody,
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.300]   not kicking out, uprooting Arabs or Palestinians.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.700]   They're gonna live in enclaves in sovereign Israel,
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.580]   and we're going to live in, probably, in enclaves there,
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.940]   probably through transportational continuity
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.340]   as opposed to territorial continuity.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.860]   That is, you know, for example, you can have tunnels
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.100]   and overpasses and so on that connect
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.860]   the various communities, and we're doing that right now.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.180]   We're doing that right now, and it actually works.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.860]   I think there is a solution to this.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.540]   It's not the perfect world that people think of
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.480]   because that model, I think, doesn't apply here.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.860]   If it applies elsewhere, it's a question.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.540]   I don't think so, but I think there's one other thing,
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.940]   and that's the main thing that I've been involved in.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.780]   You know, people said,
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.700]   if you don't solve the Palestinian problem,
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.100]   you're not gonna get to the Arab world.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.540]   You're not gonna have peace with the Arab world.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.220]   Remember, the Palestinians are about 2% of the Arab world,
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.220]   and the other, you know, the other 98%,
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.620]   you're not gonna make peace with them, and that's our goal.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.780]   And for a long time, people accepted that.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.420]   After the initial peace treaties with Egypt,
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.620]   with Prime Minister Begin of the Likud
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.660]   and President Sadat of Egypt, and then with Jordan,
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.780]   between Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:56.620]   for a quarter of a century,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.820]   we didn't have any more peace treaties
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.540]   because people said, you gotta go through the Palestinians,
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.620]   and the Palestinians, they don't want a solution
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.380]   of the kind that I described, or any kind,
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.380]   except the one that involves the dissolution
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.660]   of the state of Israel.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.820]   So we could wait another half century.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.900]   And I said, no, I mean, I don't think
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.500]   that we should accept the premise
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.300]   that we have to wait for the Palestinians
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.420]   because we'll have to wait forever.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.420]   So I decided to do it differently.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:25.380]   I decided to go directly to the Arab capitals
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:29.020]   and to make the historic Abraham Accords,
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.100]   and essentially reversing the equation,
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   not a peace process that goes inside out, but outside in.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.780]   And we went directly to these countries
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   and forged these breakthrough peace accords
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.380]   with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain,
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.860]   with Morocco, and with Sudan.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.260]   And we're now trying to expand that
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.100]   in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.220]   - What does it take to do that with Saudi Arabia,
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.620]   with the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman?
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.820]   - You know, I'm a student of history,
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.740]   and I read a lot of history, and I read that,
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.020]   you know, in the Versailles discussions
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.540]   after World War I, President Woodrow Wilson said,
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.940]   "I believe in open covenants openly arrived at."
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.220]   I have my correction.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.780]   I believed in open covenants secretly arrived at.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.720]   So we're not gonna advance a Saudi-Israeli peace
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.460]   by having it publicly discussed.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.900]   And in any case, it's a decision of the Saudis
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.600]   if they wanna do it,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.660]   but there's obviously a mutual interest.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.820]   So here's my view.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:42.260]   If we try to wait for the 2% in order to get to the 98%,
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.060]   we're gonna fail, and we have failed.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.540]   If we go to the 98%, we have a much greater chance
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.620]   of persuading the 2%.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.820]   You know why?
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:54.500]   Because the 2%, the Palestinian hope
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.100]   to vanquish the State of Israel and not make peace with it
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.460]   is based, among other things, on the assumption
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.040]   that eventually the 98%, the rest of the Arab world
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.540]   will kick in and destroy the Jewish state,
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.460]   help them dissolve or destroy the Jewish state.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.460]   When that hope is taken away,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.340]   then you begin to have a turn
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.980]   to the realistic solutions of coexistence.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.860]   By the way, they require compromise on the Israeli side too.
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.660]   And I'm perfectly cognizant of that and willing to do that,
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.780]   but I think a realistic compromise will be struck
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.420]   much more readily when the conflict
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.780]   between Israel and the Arab states,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.980]   the Arab world is effectively solved.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.260]   And I think we're on that path.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.180]   It was a conceptual change, just like, you know,
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.060]   I've been involved in a few, I told you,
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.260]   the conceptual battle is always the most difficult one.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.140]   And, you know, I had to fight this battle
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.100]   to convert a semi-socialist state
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.020]   into a free market capitalist state.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.140]   And I have to say that most people today recognize
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.380]   the power of competition and the benefits of free markets.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.300]   So we also had to fight this battle that said,
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.220]   you have to go through the, you know,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   the Palestinian straight, S-T-R-A-I-T,
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.940]   to get to the other places.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.260]   There's no way to avoid this.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   You know, you have to go through this impassable pass.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.900]   And I think that now people are recognizing
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:28.460]   that we'll go around it and probably circle back.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.340]   And that I think actually gives hope,
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   not only to have an Arab-Israeli peace,
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.660]   but circling back an Israeli-Palestinian peace.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.660]   And obviously this is not something that you find
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.420]   in the sound bites and so on,
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:44.620]   but in the popular discussion of the press.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.980]   But that idea is permeating.
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.180]   And I think it's the right idea,
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.260]   'cause I think it's the only one that will work.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.300]   - So expanding the circle of peace,
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.060]   just to linger on that, requires what?
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:59.300]   Secretly talking man to man, human to human,
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.160]   to leaders of other nations.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.620]   - Theoretically, you're right.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.060]   - Theoretically, okay.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.780]   Well, let me ask you another theoretical question.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:15.580]   On the circle of peace, as a student of history,
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.780]   looking at the ideas of war and peace,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.340]   what do you think can achieve peace in the war in Ukraine?
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.380]   Looking at another part of the world,
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.780]   if you consider the fight for peace
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.500]   in this part of the world,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.780]   how can you apply that to that other part of the world,
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.340]   between Russia and Ukraine now?
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:43.700]   - I think it's one of the savage horrors of history
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.260]   and one of the great tragedies that is occurring.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   And let me say in advance that if I have any opportunity
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:58.940]   to use my contacts to help bring about
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.420]   an end to this tragedy, I'll do so.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.460]   I've had, I know both leaders,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.340]   but I don't just jump in and assume.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.980]   There'll be a desire at a certain point,
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:16.220]   because the conditions have created the possibility.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:21.220]   of helping stop this carnage, then I'll do it.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.020]   And that's why I choose my words carefully,
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:28.020]   because I think that may be the best thing that I could do.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:35.140]   Look, I think what you see in Ukraine is what happens
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.580]   if you have territorial designs on a territory
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:41.740]   by a country that has nuclear weapons.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:47.300]   And that to me, you see the change in the equation.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.980]   Now, I think that people are loathe to use nuclear weapons
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.420]   and I'm not sure that I would think
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:59.260]   that the Russian side would use them with happy abandon.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.460]   I don't think that's the question,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.140]   but you see how the whole configuration changes
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.660]   when that happens.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.580]   So you have to be very careful
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.340]   on how you resolve this conflict,
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:16.340]   so it doesn't go off the rails, so to speak.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:20.060]   By the way, the corollary is here.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.620]   We don't want Iran, which is an aggressive force
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.660]   with an just aggressive ideology of dominating
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.140]   first the Muslim world and then eliminating Israel
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:34.500]   and then becoming a global force, having nuclear weapons.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.460]   It's totally different when they don't have it
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.060]   than when they do have it.
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.280]   And that's why one of my main goals has been
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.020]   to prevent Iran from having the means
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.300]   to the means of mass destruction,
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.140]   which will be used atomic bombs,
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   which they openly say will be used against us.
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.180]   And you can understand that.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.080]   How to bring about an end to Ukraine?
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.820]   I have my ideas.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:01.820]   I don't think it's worthwhile discussing them now
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:06.780]   because they might be required later on.
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.260]   - Do you believe in the power of conversation
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:11.520]   since you have contacts with Volodymyr Zelensky
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.640]   and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in a room
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.360]   and discussing how the end of war can be brought about?
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.720]   - I think it's a combination of that,
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.320]   but I think it's the question of interest
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   and whether you have to get both sides to a point
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.520]   where they think that that conversation
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.360]   will lead to something useful.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.220]   I don't think they're there right now.
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.960]   - What part of this is just basic human ego,
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.480]   stubbornness, all of this between leaders,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.160]   which is why I bring up the power of conversation,
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.600]   of sitting in a room realizing we're human beings
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.520]   and then there's a history that connects Ukraine and Russia.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.920]   - Yeah, I don't think they're in a position
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.840]   to enter a room right now, realistically.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.800]   I mean, you can posit that it would be good
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.480]   if that could happen, but entering the room
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.080]   is sometimes more complicated than what happens in the room.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.720]   And there's a lot of pre-negotiation,
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.080]   on the negotiation, then you negotiate endlessly
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.000]   on the negotiation, they're not even there.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.920]   - It took a lot of work for you to get a handshake
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.440]   in the past.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.460]   - It's an interesting question.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.480]   How did the peace, the Abraham Accords,
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.600]   how did that begin?
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.880]   You know, I mean, we had decades,
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.720]   70 years or 65 years where these people
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.120]   would not meet openly or even secretly
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.720]   with an Israeli leader.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.600]   Yeah, we had the Mossad making contacts
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.880]   with them all the time and so on,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.680]   but how do we break the ice to the top level of leadership?
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.820]   Well, we broke the ice because I took a very strong stance
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.660]   against Iran and the Gulf States understood
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.120]   that Iran is a formidable danger to them,
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.000]   so we had a common interest.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.960]   And the second thing is that because of the economic reforms
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.560]   that we had produced in Israel,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.040]   Israel became a technological powerhouse
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.960]   and that could help their nations,
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960]   not only in terms of anything,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.020]   just bettering the life of their peoples.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:17.160]   And the combination of the desire to have some kind
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:23.040]   of protection against Iran or some kind of cooperation
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.720]   against Iran and civilian economic cooperation
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.640]   came to a head when I gave a speech
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.600]   in the American Congress, which I didn't do lightheartedly.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.760]   I had to decide to challenge a sitting American president
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.240]   and on the so-called Iranian deal,
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.500]   which I thought would pave Iran's path with gold
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.400]   to be an effective nuclear power, that's what would happen.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.720]   So I went there and in the course of giving that speech
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.860]   before the joint session of Congress,
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.900]   our delegation received calls from Gulf States
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.860]   who said, "We can't believe what your prime minister
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:10.060]   is doing, he's challenging the president
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:10.900]   of the United States."
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.700]   Well, I had no choice, I mean,
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.600]   because I thought my country's own existence was imperiled.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.260]   And remember, we always understand
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.240]   through changing administrations that America,
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.940]   under no matter what leadership,
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.060]   is always the irreplaceable and indispensable ally of Israel
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.380]   and will always remain that, we can have arguments
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:32.980]   as we have, but in the families, we say in the mishpocha,
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.420]   you know, it's the family.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.560]   But nevertheless, I was forced to take a stand.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.560]   That produced calls from Gulf States
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.180]   that ultimately led to clandestine meetings
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:50.320]   that ultimately flowered into the Abraham Accords.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.340]   Then, and I think we're at a point where the idea
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.180]   of ending the Arab-Israeli conflict,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.160]   not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.500]   the Arab-Israeli conflict can happen.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.860]   I'm not sure it will, it depends on quite a few things,
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.500]   but it could happen.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.380]   And if it happens, it might open up the ending
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.780]   of the Israeli-Islamic conflict.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.780]   Remember, the Arab world is a small part,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.860]   it's an important part, but there are large
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.420]   Islamic populations and could bring about
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.620]   an end to the, an historic enmity
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.140]   between Islam and Judaism.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.820]   It could be a great thing.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.940]   So I'm looking at this larger thing.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.100]   You know, you can be hobbled by saying,
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.380]   well, well, you know, you've had this, you know,
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.900]   this hiccup in Gaza or, you know, this,
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:48.180]   this or that thing happening in the Palestinians.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.380]   I don't, it's important for us because we want security,
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.980]   but I think the larger question is,
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.860]   can we break out into a much wider peace
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.340]   and ultimately come back and make the peace
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.740]   between Israel and the Palestinians,
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.020]   rather than waiting to solve that
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:07.380]   and never getting to the,
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.140]   to paint on the larger canvas.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.100]   I want to paint on the larger canvas
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.120]   and come back to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.900]   - As you write about in your book,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.420]   what have you learned about life from your father?
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.780]   - My father was a great historian
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:31.540]   and well, he taught me several things.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.860]   He said that the,
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:38.420]   the first condition for a living organism
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.980]   is to identify danger in time.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.540]   Because if you don't, you could be devoured,
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.340]   you could be destroyed very quickly.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.940]   And that's the nature of human conflict.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.500]   In fact, for the Jewish people,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.660]   we didn't, we lost the capacity to identify danger in time
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:59.620]   and we were almost devoured and destroyed by the Nazi threat.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.220]   So when I see somebody parroting the Nazi goal
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.020]   of destroying the Jewish state,
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.480]   I try to mobilize the country and the world in time,
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.340]   because I think Iran is a global threat,
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.660]   not only a threat to Israel.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.140]   That's the first thing.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.700]   The second thing is I once asked him,
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.260]   before I got elected, I said,
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.060]   "Well, what do you think is the most important quality
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.420]   for a prime minister of Israel?"
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.220]   And he came back with a question, "What do you think?"
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.620]   And I said, "Well, you have to have a vision
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:36.020]   and you have to have the flexibility of navigating
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.180]   and working towards that vision,
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.260]   be flexible, but understand where you're heading."
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.820]   And he said, "Well, you need that for anything.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:46.160]   You need it for, if you're a university president
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.760]   or if you're a leader of a corporation or anything,
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.500]   anybody would have to have that."
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.180]   I said, "All right, so what do you need
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.940]   to be the leader of Israel?"
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.940]   He said, he came back to me with a word that stunned me.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.980]   He said, "Education.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:09.740]   You need a broad and deep education
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.280]   or you'll be at the mercy of your clerks."
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.980]   Or the press or whatever.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.580]   You have to be able to do that.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.740]   Now, as I spend time in government,
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:30.040]   being reelected by the people of Israel,
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:37.360]   I recognize more and more how right it was.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.800]   You need to constantly ask yourself,
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.740]   where's the direction we wanna take the country?
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.140]   How do we achieve that goal?
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.380]   But also understand that new disciplines are being added.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.020]   You have to learn all the time.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.820]   You have to learn all the time.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:57.820]   You have to add to your intellectual capital all the time.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.380]   Kissinger said that, he wrote that,
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.660]   "Once you enter public life,
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.260]   you begin to draw on your intellectual capital
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.980]   and it'll be depleted very quickly if you stay a long time."
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.640]   I disagree with that.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.180]   I think you have to constantly, constantly increase
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.400]   your understanding of things as they change
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.220]   because my father was right.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.980]   You need to broaden and deepen your education
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.880]   as you go along.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.020]   You can't just sit back and say,
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.420]   "Well, I studied some things in university
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.500]   or in college or in Boston or at MIT and that's enough.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.340]   I've done it."
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.880]   No, learn, learn, learn, learn, learn, learn, never stop.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.660]   - And if I may suggest, as part of the education,
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.300]   I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky,
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.020]   in the plentiful of time you have
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.300]   as a prime minister to read.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.060]   - Well, I've read him, but I'll tell you what I think
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.420]   is bigger than Dostoevsky.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.380]   - Oh no, who's that?
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.460]   - Not who's that, but what's that?
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:57.620]   Dan Rather came to see me with his grandson a few years ago
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.180]   and he asked me, the grandson asked me,
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.900]   he was a student in Ivory League College
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.420]   and he said he's 18 years old
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.280]   and he wants to study to enter politics.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.380]   And he said, "What's the most important thing
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:19.180]   that I have to study to enter a political life?"
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.760]   And I said, "You have three things you have to study, okay?
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.360]   History, history, and history."
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.640]   That's the fundamental discipline for political life,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.460]   but then you have to study other things,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.260]   study economics, study politics and so on
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.620]   and study the military.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.220]   If you have, I had an advantage
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.120]   because I spent some years there,
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.060]   so I learned a lot of that,
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.940]   but I had to acquire the other disciplines
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.820]   and you never acquire enough.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.840]   So read, read, read, and by the way,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.040]   if I have to choose, I read history, history, and history.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.100]   Good works of history, not lousy books.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:05.540]   - Last question, you've talked about a survival of a nation.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.060]   You yourself are a mortal being.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.440]   Do you contemplate your mortality?
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.820]   Do you contemplate your death?
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.020]   Are you afraid of death?
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.220]   - Aren't you?
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.060]   - Yes.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.980]   - Who's not?
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:19.940]   I mean, if you're a conscience,
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.860]   if you're a being with conscience,
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:26.380]   I mean, one of the unhappy things about the human brain
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:31.380]   is that it can contemplate its own demise.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.760]   And so we have to, we all make our compromises with this,
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.240]   but I think the question is what lives on?
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.560]   What lives on beyond us?
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.320]   And I think that you have to define how much
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   of a posterity do you want to influence?
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.120]   I cannot influence the course of humanity.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.200]   We all are specks, little specks.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.960]   So that's not the issue, but in my case,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.280]   I've devoted my life to a very defined purpose,
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.800]   and that is to assure the future and security
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.600]   and I would say permanence,
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.720]   but that is obviously a limited thing of the Jewish state
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.160]   and the Jewish people.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.600]   I don't think one can exist without the other.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.280]   So I've devoted my life to that,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.040]   and I hope that in my time on this earth
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.060]   and in my years in office, I'd have contributed to that.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.840]   - Well, you had one heck of a life,
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   starting from MIT to six terms as prime minister.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.000]   Thank you for this stroll through human history
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.320]   and for this conversation, it was an honor.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.720]   - Thank you, and I hope you come back to Israel many times.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.280]   It's, remember, it's the innovation nation.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.880]   It's a robust democracy.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.080]   Don't believe all the stuff that you're being told.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.200]   It'll remain that.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.680]   It cannot be any other way.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.200]   And it's, I'll tell you the other thing,
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.040]   it's the best ally of the United States.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.440]   And its importance is growing by the day
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.120]   because our capacities in the information world
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.480]   are growing by the day.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.400]   We need a coalition of the like-minded smarts.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.320]   This is a smart nation,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.640]   and we share the basic values of freedom and liberty
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   with the United States.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   So the coalition of the smarts means Israel is the sixth eye
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.120]   and America has no better ally.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.520]   - All right, now off mic,
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.040]   I'm gonna force you to finally tell me
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.080]   who is gonna win Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.720]   but that's a good time to end.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.840]   We ran out of time here.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.040]   - I'll tell you outside.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.800]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.480]   with Benjamin Netanyahu.

[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.360]   An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.440]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.640]   (upbeat music)
