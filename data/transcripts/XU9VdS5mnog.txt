[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300]   To me, this problem is not just menopause.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.200]   What's more interesting is to talk about perimenopause.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.040]   So perimenopause is the period of time before your final menstrual cycle.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   And for most women, depending on how attuned you are to the symptoms, it can last for 10
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   years.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   So I'm still in perimenopause.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.360]   It's been like 20 years because I've been tracking it so carefully.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.600]   It usually gets kicked off by having your cycle get closer together.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.580]   So that can happen in your 30s or your 40s.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.160]   You go from 20 days to 25 days, that sort of thing.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.720]   You may notice that you start sleeping more poorly because progesterone is so important.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.120]   You talked about that with Kyle.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.380]   You may notice it as more anxiety, difficulty sleeping.
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.120]   And that probably is related to the estrogen receptor.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.000]   So your alpha is estrogen receptor, alpha is angio.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.520]   It increases anxiety.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.600]   ER beta is associated with an anxiolytic activity.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.040]   And then there's a total of about six estrogen receptors now.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.360]   There's the G-protein coupled estrogen receptors, and those are mixed, anxiolytic, anxiogenic.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.120]   So there's this whole period of perimenopause, and what's most fascinating to me, and we've
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.080]   got to talk about this either today or another time, is that there is this massive, massive
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.840]   change that happens in the female brain that people are not talking about enough.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.200]   And so looking at the work of Lisa Moscone at Cornell, from starting around age 40, there
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.600]   is this massive change in cerebral metabolism.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.840]   So you can do FDG PET scans, you can look at glucose uptake, and there's about, on average,
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   a 20% decline from premenopause, up to like age 35, to perimenopause, to postmenopause.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080]   The women who are having the most symptoms in perimenopause and menopause, the hot flashes,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   the night sweats, the difficulty sleeping, those are the ones who have the most significant
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.240]   cerebral hypometabolism.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.040]   - So it's almost like a, I don't want to scare people with this language, but it's a low-level
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   or let's call it pseudo-dementia of sorts.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.080]   - Yes, it seems to be a phenotype that you can then map to Alzheimer's disease, because
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.600]   that's Lisa Moscone's work.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.760]   She's looking at, okay, Alzheimer's disease is not a disease of old age, it is disease
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.960]   of middle age.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.320]   But are some of the biomarkers that we can define that can tell you what your risk is?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.880]   I've got a mother and a grandmother with Alzheimer's disease, you can believe I am all over this
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   data.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   - And insulin resistance.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   - Huge part of it.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   - Insensitivity, as we talked about it before, seems to be somewhere in there, which I think
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720]   when that idea first surfaced, a few people were like, "Really?"
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   But then of course, right?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.320]   I mean, the brain is this incredibly metabolically demanding organ.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.280]   You deprive neurons of fuel sources, or you make them less sensitive to fuel sources,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.440]   they start dying, they certainly start firing less.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.640]   And I think now it's, thanks to Lisa's work, work that you've done and talked about quite
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.840]   a lot in your books and elsewhere, I think has really highlighted for people that metabolism
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.920]   and metabolomics is going to be as important as genes and genomics when it comes to dementia,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.400]   perhaps especially in women, is it safe to say that?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:46.960]   - I think so, because we believe that the system is regulated by estrogen.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.520]   So the decline in estrogen starting around age 40, 43 is kind of the average, seems to
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.560]   be the driver behind cerebral hypometabolism.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.720]   The way I describe it to my patients is it's like slow brain energy.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.120]   So you walk into a room, you can't remember why, you just notice that you can't manage
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.520]   all the tasks the way that you once could.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.800]   Things are just a little slower.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.080]   And I say that to women and they're like, "I have that, help me."
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.280]   So this is then circling back to WHI, where women are scared to death of taking hormone
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   therapy.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.080]   And we've got all of these women that are marching toward potentially a greater risk
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.240]   of Alzheimer's disease, and they have this opportunity in their 40s and their 50s to
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.160]   take hormone therapy, and they may not be offered it.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.560]   Because the typical conventional approach based on WHI is to say, "Unless you're having
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.600]   hot flashes and night sweats that are severe, I'm not going to give you hormone therapy."
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.040]   And I just want to call that out.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   I would say, "No, that is not the way to approach it."
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.280]   However, the concept right now in conventional medicine is that hot flashes and night sweats
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.520]   are these nuisance symptoms that we will take care of temporarily, maybe with a little bit
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.040]   of estrogen progesterone or a birth control pill, because it's given a lot.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   - Or that they pass.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   - Or that you just suck it up, suck it up.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.780]   It doesn't matter that you're not sleeping anymore.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.280]   Turn down the temperature in your room.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   And that's not right, because hot flashes and night sweats are a biomarker of cardiometabolic
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   disease.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.960]   They are a biomarker of increased bone loss.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.860]   They are a biomarker of changes in the brain.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.640]   So many of these symptoms that occur in perimenopause are not driven by the ovaries, they are driven
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   by the brain.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.720]   [music]
