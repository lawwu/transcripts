[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.840]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   Today I'm going to kick off a series called The Most Valuable Lessons I Learned as a Financial
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.720]   Advisor.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.400]   Some of these lessons will be the lessons that I learned from the business.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.880]   Some of the lessons will be the lessons that I learned about personal finance from my clients.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.760]   But today we kick it off with the number one lesson, which is this.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.000]   There's always business available, but you've got to get up and go get it.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.600]   Now to put that into context, let me share with you how I got into the financial services
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800]   industry.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.160]   In summer of 2008, I was laid off from a job where I had been working in the marketing
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.080]   industry for a small company, but I had been working as a mid-level analyst in that company.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   They eliminated my job position and laid me off.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.320]   After I was laid off, I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.060]   I had desired to leave the company.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.160]   They laid me off in June or July.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.760]   I had been planning to leave in January, but I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.720]   I did, however, have some attributes sketched out of what I wanted in a job.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.000]   I just wasn't sure exactly how to get there.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.320]   I wanted a number of different things.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.840]   I wanted to be paid for performance, not for time.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   I wanted to have revenue that would be built up over time.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   I wanted to be geographically independent.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.760]   I wanted to build something that would last and that would really grow.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.920]   I didn't want to just go and work in a corporation.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.280]   After I left the company, I was having lunch with one of my former bosses.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.880]   He suggested to me that I consider going into the financial services business.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.360]   I had never thought about financial services prior to that time, but on his suggestion,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.080]   I started interviewing in the industry.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   I interviewed around a few different companies.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.320]   I wound up signing a contract to join a company that is a large traditional life insurance
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.140]   company cum financial services company.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.480]   In this company, I decided that I would have the opportunity to learn and I could build
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   a business without having to come up with a product.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.240]   I knew that I wanted to own a business, but I didn't have any great product ideas.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.560]   At the time, I didn't understand the value of just adopting a business model that's already
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.480]   proven, purchasing a franchise model, so to speak.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760]   I understand that greatly now.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   At that time, I didn't know.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040]   So, I said, "Well, if I start a financial services industry business, then I can build
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.360]   the business, but I don't have to manage the product."
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.840]   That seemed very attractive and appealing to me.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.920]   So, in fall of 2008, I began my practice with no experience and just the tiniest bit of
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920]   knowledge.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.640]   I'd been a long-time personal finance buff, so of course I had some ideas that I thought
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.360]   would help everybody in the world, but I didn't know anything about the technical side of
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   financial services.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.760]   So, the first step that was taken was to start with an insurance licensing course.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.120]   In the company that I joined, their approach and their recommendation for new company representatives
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.600]   was to start with an insurance focus.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.760]   I felt like that was a really good idea.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   I still think I still recommend that to other people.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.720]   It makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.800]   Here, I'm differentiating between having an insurance-focused practice versus an investments-focused
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   practice.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.000]   The idea is this.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.680]   In a very short period of time, I could teach anybody enough about insurance where they
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   could be very useful.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.080]   Give me a day-long seminar and I could give you enough knowledge on life insurance that
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.360]   you could go out and help people choose an appropriate amount of life insurance for their
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   family.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.900]   There are companies that do this all day long, a few hours of training, and they send newly
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.040]   minted life insurance agents out into the field.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.560]   I think they help a lot of people by doing that.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.040]   So there's a shorter learning curve for basic insurance planning for new financial services
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.600]   representatives than there is in investments.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.640]   With investments, it's such a wild and worldly frontier out there that all the time you're
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.960]   coming across something new you've never heard of and trying to answer a question.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.400]   It takes a little bit more time and more instruction.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.200]   The first step was to take what's called in my state a 40-hour class.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600]   Most states have similar requirements.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.160]   In my state, Florida, to get an insurance license, you sit for 40 hours of classroom
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   instruction, and then you sit for the 215 state insurance licensing exam.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.480]   Upon successful completion of the exam, you're now licensed to sell life insurance, health
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.840]   insurance, disability insurance, and annuities.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.980]   After that, I went to company training.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.760]   Each company does training a little bit differently, but the company that I joined focused right
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   up front.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.960]   It was a three-week training program.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.640]   Most of the first three weeks of training was, I would say about 70% of it was focused
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.240]   on the business model, how to actually run the business in terms of daily activity, and
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.880]   how the marketing model works.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:24.040]   About 30% is based upon actual specifically detailed technical instruction.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.880]   It's really hard in the financial services business to do technical instruction in a
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.400]   classroom format.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.280]   It's a format that's better suited to reading and to working with somebody who's more knowledgeable
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.880]   than classroom-focused format.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   The first week, however, we started off with understanding the business, understanding
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.840]   the business model, and then we had to put pedal to the metal and actually figure out
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   how to bring in customers.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.200]   Now, to describe the prospecting model in financial services, there are various prospecting
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   models.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.560]   Every business has a prospecting model.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.120]   Where do your customers come from?
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.760]   For some people, the prospecting model is a sign hung above the door.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.280]   For others, it's television ads.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.000]   For others, it's internet traffic.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.600]   For others, it's personal referrals, et cetera.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.560]   Every business has to figure out how do they attract an interested, prospective customer
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.040]   to them.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   That's the first basis.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.200]   Well, I was taught a prospecting model that's called referred lead prospecting.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.320]   Essentially, the way that referred lead prospecting works is this.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.460]   The business person here, the financial services rep, asks people for introductions to other
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.980]   people who might be interested in their particular service and then asks for permission to reach
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.780]   out to those people to see if they'd be interested in setting up a meeting with them.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.320]   It's a time-tested, proven business model that very few people like.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.240]   Many people want to do what I call marketing, which is to set out all kinds of information
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.920]   and let the prospect and the prospective customers find them organically without having to face
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.900]   the risk of rejection.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.420]   Can marketing work?
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.520]   I think it can.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.580]   It's very difficult, however.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.740]   It's very difficult to do effective marketing.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.460]   But with referred lead prospecting, the business person can be in charge.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.980]   They can be in charge of the process.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.960]   So the first week of training, Monday through Thursday, we had classroom instruction.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.100]   We learned all about referred lead prospecting.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.300]   We were given sample sales language to memorize, to use.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.280]   And then Thursday afternoon, we were given our marching orders for what was going to
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.100]   happen on Friday.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.220]   Before I continue the story, just a moment to tell you what happened on Friday.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.300]   Sponsor of today's show is Paladin Registry.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.340]   I'm no longer a financial advisor.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.660]   I know I've surrendered all of my licenses even though I took the insurance exams and
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.660]   all of that stuff.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.660]   I'm no longer a financial advisor.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.560]   I don't sell any financial products of any kind, unfortunately, because I would be making
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.180]   a ton of commissions right now.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.560]   But I do have a way to introduce you to prospective financial advisors if you're looking for them.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.220]   One great way to do that is to use a registry service and the best registry service that
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.980]   I know of is a company called Paladin Registry.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.980]   A registry service basically is a way of bringing screening criteria to somebody who calls themselves
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.140]   a financial advisor.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.540]   As you heard from my story, it's relatively easy to get an insurance license.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.500]   It's also not quite as easy but still pretty easy to get an investments license.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.660]   So with these two licenses in hand, you can go and set up a business.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.720]   It's not that hard to get in the business but it's a little bit harder to be good.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.280]   So if you're going to hire somebody to help you with your money, how do you make sure
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.760]   that they're good?
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.920]   This comes down to the screening system put in place.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.760]   Either the company is responsible for that screening system or there's some sort of registry
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.060]   system.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.560]   If you are looking for a financial advisor, choose from a pool of qualified candidates.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:18.440]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, that's spelled P-A-L-A-D-I-N, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.720]   or there's a link right on your phone or in the show notes for today's show at the blog
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.700]   at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.840]   That link, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin will forward you through to a landing page.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   That's a capture page where you'll put in your name, your email address, your phone
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.280]   number, how much money you have, where you live, etc.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.560]   The Paladin registry will take that information and they'll match you up with a few different
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   advisors in your local area to be able to help you to interview them.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.760]   I can't guarantee they're going to be perfect for you.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.160]   I don't know if they're going to be a personality conflict or not, but I can guarantee that
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.440]   you're starting on a better foundation than just talking to whoever random person calls
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.160]   you on the phone, which is where I'm going next.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.040]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   Back to the story.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.160]   So, Thursday afternoon, the process has been explained to us and the instructions have
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.640]   been explained to us.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.960]   And essentially, the first step is we were to assemble a list of our family and friends,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.440]   people who would know us, and go out and schedule appointments to meet with these people on
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.400]   Friday to ask them for introductions to other people who might be interested in meeting
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   us.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.880]   Now, if your skin is crawling because this is the way that things you've had to do with
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.360]   network marketing companies or things that you may have joined or done in the past, it
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.240]   should be because that's exactly the way that it is.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.480]   It's a little bit uncomfortable for most of us, and it was certainly uncomfortable for
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   me.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.980]   I think it was a little bit uncomfortable for me to ask, and it's uncomfortable for many
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.200]   people to make introductions because you're leveraging here your social capital.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.620]   Now, if you're ever in this situation, you want to make sure that you've built up quite
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.720]   a bit of social capital.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.120]   You want to make sure that your reputation is strong, that people know that you're a
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.160]   trustworthy person because then things will go a little bit better.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.420]   So all during the week, Monday through Thursday, we had been phoning our family and friends
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.400]   and scheduling appointments.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   And on Thursday afternoon, as we're there in training, hearing the instructions for
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   Friday, which is when we were to go out on these appointments and get introductions,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.600]   get referrals, and the reason I go back and forth between those two words is because they
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.760]   have a different technical definition.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.800]   So let's just use the word referrals as being more commonly used.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.520]   We would go out and get referrals.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.800]   In that case, somebody swung by the office and they said a challenge to me.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.960]   And they said it to the whole classroom, but they said, "You can go out and on one day
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.840]   you can get referred to 100 people.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.400]   Let's see who can come back with 100 people."
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.120]   I didn't know if that goal was hard or not, but I figured if they said I could get referred
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   to 100 people, so I took it seriously and I had a busy day full of appointments and
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.080]   I asked for introductions.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.360]   And on the end of Friday, I came back into the training on Monday morning and I had over
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.560]   100 referrals on my list.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.040]   A name of somebody who somebody thought, "Hey, this person might enjoy meeting Joshua," on
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.120]   a phone number that I could reach out to them and say, "Hey, I was introduced to you."
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   Started with my parents, moved on from there, siblings, friends, reached out to all my personal
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:36.440]   friends, and I relied on their knowledge of me as a person for their confidence to make
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   that introduction.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.160]   When I came back in on Monday morning, I was shocked to find that most people only had
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.840]   a handful of introductions.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.800]   There were a few other people that had in the high, I think I had the most.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.240]   There were a few other people that had close to 100.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.680]   Most of the people had 20 or 30.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.240]   I thought, "Huh, doesn't seem that hard to me just going out and ask people."
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.880]   But I quickly realized that I had started the ball rolling on a system.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.280]   I had made lots of phone calls, set up lots of appointments, and then I had gotten lots
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.680]   of referrals.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:20.160]   Well, then the training task for week two was to call those people and schedule appointments,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.240]   which were to occur on the following Thursday and Friday.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.680]   We would go out with experienced reps from the company.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.840]   They would do all of the actual work, and our job was just to set the appointment.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.240]   That's when I started learning.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.880]   I made my first sale.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.560]   I think it was the fourth week I was in the business.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.960]   The first three weeks in training and the first sale was the first week out.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   Our business model was not what they call a one-call close, the old life insurance model
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   where you sell the policy right there when you're there.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.440]   That was not our business model at all.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.920]   The lesson that I learned that first day of training, however, went with me throughout
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.040]   my time in the financial services business.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.820]   It was a lesson that I repeated many, many times.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.960]   There were many times where when I needed new clients, I had used and gone through all
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.040]   of my prospective referrals, made phone calls.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   Some people said yes.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.720]   Lots of people said no.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.800]   Whenever I needed clients, I could pick up the phone and go out and call people.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:32.040]   What I learned from the model is that I could control the results by controlling the input.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.640]   See, the industry statistics were that if I would do what I did, which was go and meet
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.680]   with people, ask them to be introduced to their friends, we would describe the type
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.760]   of person that we wanted to meet with in early years.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.440]   It was, "Do they have a pulse?
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   If they do, I'll go talk to them."
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.520]   As I grew in my expertise and my knowledge, you become much more selective to try to work
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.400]   with whatever type of client that you want to work with.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.760]   But as I grew in that and I gained more, I started to experience the same numbers as
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.040]   the industry would experience.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.400]   So essentially, the numbers would work like this.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.000]   For every thousand people that I was introduced to, I would call those thousand people.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.400]   I would use a very simple phone script, which basically went something like this, "Joe,
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   my name is Joshua.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.000]   I'm friends with your buddy, Tom.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.160]   Tom said you're a good guy.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.560]   I work in the life insurance and investments business.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.200]   Would you have any interest in meeting with me?"
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.360]   There's a little bit more than that.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.480]   Tom didn't say he needed anything, because of course not.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.680]   "Would you have any interest in meeting with me?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.080]   Share with you the areas I work in and be a contact for you."
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.520]   That's basically the phoning language.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.240]   Of the thousand people that I would call, 500 people would say yes, 500 people would
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.720]   say no.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.360]   So half of them would say yes and half of them would say no.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:59.640]   When I'd go out and meet with those 500 people that said yes, when I was there, most of them,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.960]   about 400 of them, three to 400 of them, would share with me information about their financial
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.520]   lives, their financial goals and dreams.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.560]   I'd filter that through.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.800]   About 300 of them would have some kind of active need.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.920]   We'd call that in the business having an open case.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.280]   They needed something.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.560]   They were interested in seeing numbers for something.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.000]   How much does life insurance cost?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.180]   Can I get disability insurance?
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.860]   My dad and mom are getting older.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.920]   Maybe I should buy long-term care insurance.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.120]   We're going to be shopping our health insurance around next year, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   Those are called an open case.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.440]   About 300 of them would open up a case.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   Then of those 300, in the first year after the open case appointment, 60 of them would
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   buy.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.920]   They would buy an insurance policy.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.640]   In the second year, between months 12 and 24 after first meeting of them, 30 of them
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.840]   would buy.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.480]   In the third year, between months 24 and 36 after originally meeting me, 10 of them would
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.400]   buy.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.040]   So as you build the business, you put the people in up front.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   You go out and meet with them.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.680]   You talk to them about their needs, et cetera.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:11.600]   Out of 1,000 introductions, you wind up with 100 clients over a three-year period of time.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.040]   It was consistent and proven that those numbers would work.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.760]   Of course, I didn't know who was going to be the big case, who was going to be the little
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.000]   case, where was it going to come from, but it was consistent and proven that if I did
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.760]   the up front activity, I could get the back end results.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.160]   That lesson went deep into me.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.760]   To this day, it's probably one of the most valuable lessons that I learned from my work
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.280]   as a financial advisor because it trained me and it changed me.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.040]   It was brutally hard for me to do that work.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   I was insecure.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.560]   When I started, I was 23 years old.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.280]   I knew my own ignorance.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.480]   I knew that I wasn't the most experienced person.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.960]   I had all these personal shortcomings and it was hard, but I learned that if I put in
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.920]   the work up front and just worked it through the process, worked it through the system,
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.480]   on the back end, I could get the business out.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   What I loved about that was it put me in control.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.480]   It changed the way that I saw the world.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.880]   I got to the place where I said, "I see how the world works."
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.080]   The world is not very useful.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.560]   The benefits and the rewards do not come to the person who sits and waits for them to
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.080]   come.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   The benefits and the rewards come to the person who goes out and gets them.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.920]   The guy who sits on his front porch with his rifle ready rarely has a deer pass by.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.840]   It's the guy who goes out and looks for the deer that usually finds them.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.240]   I could make up more metaphors and analogies, but I hope you get the point that it's not
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   what comes to you.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.840]   It's what you go get.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   To this day, my experiences of starting my business that way have given me the confidence
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:27.440]   that no matter the business, no matter the industry, I could walk into it and I could
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.800]   figure out a way to go and find the customers.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:38.860]   Wouldn't promise to be easy, wouldn't necessarily promise to be simple, but it's doable.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.320]   It's possible.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.400]   Not every business works well in that business model that I described to you.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.520]   Of course not.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.600]   But you'd be surprised how that focus on what can I do, what bushes can I go out and shake
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.080]   to see what birds will fly up, you'd be surprised how that changes your approach.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.520]   Another sales story deeply affected me.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.280]   When I was in that place, I used to read every sales book and every sales trainer that I
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   could find.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.760]   I came across the story of Joe Girard, who bills himself appropriately as the Guinness
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.640]   Book of World Records holder of the world's greatest salesman.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   He was the final recipient of that award before they retired the category.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.920]   Joe Girard got his start selling cars, Chevrolet dealership, I think in Detroit, Michigan.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.160]   His family was starving.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   He was out of work.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.960]   He was out of options.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.080]   He went into a Chevrolet dealership and he begged for a job.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.400]   The general manager of the Chevrolet dealership would not give him a job.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.560]   He said, "Listen, I've got to have a job.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.880]   Can you please just let me work here if I promise not to take any walk-ins off of the
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.440]   floor?"
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.560]   The guy said, "Yes."
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:04.200]   Joe Girard started his work, he started his job as a car salesperson, selling cars in
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.800]   the white pages, yellow pages, white pages, calling people in the phone book to see if
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.320]   they wanted to buy a car.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.520]   That was how he started.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.160]   He had a very fortuitous event that his first night working, he was getting ready to leave
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   the office.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.520]   Nobody had wanted to talk to him.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.320]   Nobody wanted a car and all the people that he was calling out of the yellow pages.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.360]   As he walked out the door, somebody was walking in and he had promised not to take any cars
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.440]   on the showroom floor, but he's looking all around and there's nobody to serve the customer.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.640]   He goes over and serves the customer and sells the guy a car.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   That was his first commission check.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.280]   He started by going and figuring out and saying, "I can at least cold call to sell cars."
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.800]   Cold calling is not the most efficient form of marketing, neither in the car business
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:57.360]   nor in the financial services business, but it's at least doing something.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:04.760]   Since I've learned that lesson and deeply appreciated the impact in my own life, I look
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.560]   around and I often find myself scratching my head to understand why other people haven't
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.600]   learned the lesson.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.160]   I want to talk to you for just a moment about you.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:27.280]   Are you doing the upfront hard work necessary in order to build success in your career,
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.920]   in your job or in your field of area of focus?
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.800]   Are you picking up the phone and making phone calls?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.400]   Are you going out and seeing people?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:54.120]   Are you doing the things you know you need to do with a high frequency and a high intensity?
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.940]   Nothing happens until you start working.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.640]   If you want opportunity, you've got to get out and go find it.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.720]   Opportunity comes knocking sometimes, but if it comes knocking, it's usually the person
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.760]   who's working really hard who's going to recognize it.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.720]   If you don't see any opportunity, it's time to go out and start looking for it.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:28.220]   In your business, in your job, there are tremendous opportunities available to you.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:35.640]   But if you sit at home and do nothing, your phone doesn't ring, your email inbox doesn't
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.000]   fill up.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.960]   Exposure creates opportunity and you have the opportunity to start that process.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.320]   Figure out what diligent action would look like for you in your situation.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:57.160]   If you're looking for a job, don't just wait and see what comes along.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.120]   Make phone calls.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:07.480]   Simplest thing to do, call people and tell them, "I'm looking for a job."
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.340]   I don't understand why more people don't do this, but if you lose a job or if you need
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:18.500]   a job, probably the very first thing you should do is pull out your phone, set aside a day
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:24.040]   and systematically call every single person in your phone address book and say, "I'm
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.320]   looking for a job.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   Here are my skills.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.080]   Here are the types of areas that I work in.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.820]   Do you have any recommendations or do you know anybody who's in that field of work?"
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.800]   You should do the same thing with your Facebook contacts, with your Twitter contacts, with
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.560]   your LinkedIn contacts.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.320]   You should make phone calls to those people and start the ball rolling because if you
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.920]   can get a thousand people working for you, spreading your good name all around the town
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.080]   that you live in, you're going to have a much easier time getting a job than if you sit
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.560]   at home and browse job boards.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.200]   That's the power of the financial services business.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:10.080]   Once you have established yourself as a useful, valuable, honest provider of service, you'll
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.240]   have more business than you know what to do with.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.960]   But it takes time to get that going.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.080]   You got to put the time and effort in up front.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:26.120]   In your business, you can't sit back and wait for people to find you.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.040]   In your job, you can't sit back and wait for people to find you.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:37.560]   In your website, you can't sit back and wait for people to find you.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.960]   In marketing your podcast, you can't sit back and wait for people to find you.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.440]   You've got to get out and introduce them to yourself.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.140]   It's not who you know.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.760]   It's who knows you.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.720]   And it's your job to get out and make sure that the right people know you, know what
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.400]   you do, and know what you're looking for.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   Don't sit back and wait for the business to show up.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.640]   Pick up the phone, pick up the keyboard, get out and go find it.
