[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660]   - Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.920]   We're back with Francis Chan,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.280]   who joins us again from San Francisco.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.920]   Francis and his wife Lisa are the authors of the new book,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   "You and Me Forever, Marriage in Light of Eternity."
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.760]   Francis, how do you and Lisa argue like Christians?
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720]   I think some readers of the book will be surprised
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.140]   that you and Lisa have conflict,
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.720]   but of course married couples won't be surprised at all.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.060]   We all do at some point.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.560]   So when it comes to verbal conflicts and disagreements,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.080]   what is a core lesson that you have learned
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   about how to argue with your spouse
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160]   in a way that honors Christ?
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.480]   - Yes, Lisa and I argue.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.960]   Honestly, we don't argue that much
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.960]   because we realize we don't have time for this.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.040]   We're on a mission.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.520]   She describes it like there's a TV show
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.440]   called "The Amazing Race"
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.380]   where couples are racing to get to this finish line
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.960]   and they're competing with other couples.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.740]   But you see certain ones fight
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.580]   and they start losing ground
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.540]   and they argue with each other and they lose the race.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.460]   And we look at our lives very much like that.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.040]   Like there are things for us to do.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.580]   And if we, we're here to seek his kingdom,
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.780]   we're here to make disciples.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.660]   And if we spend our time just fighting with each other,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.880]   it's gonna keep us from his mission.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.820]   And so one of the ways we fight is always realizing,
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.220]   okay, divorce isn't an option.
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.820]   And also we don't have a lot of time
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.420]   to argue about petty things
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.820]   because we're dealing with eternal things.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.020]   And so we keep that in our minds.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.980]   Another thing that we keep in mind,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.500]   for me, 1 Peter 3 comes to mind
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.820]   where it tells us husbands to live with our wives
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.580]   in this understanding way,
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880]   to treat her as a fellow heir of the grace of life
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.500]   so that our prayers may not be hindered.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.060]   Okay, if I don't do this right,
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.740]   God's not gonna listen to my prayers
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.060]   and I gotta have him hear my prayers.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.220]   That's the most important thing in my life.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.980]   And so I need to treat her as a daughter of God.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.040]   I need to honor her as we speak.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.020]   And again, I mean, the biggest word I could say is humility.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.860]   I mean, that's what causes all this, right?
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.060]   A lack of humility.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.100]   The goal is becoming like Jesus.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.840]   The goal is not winning an argument.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.780]   It is pleasing Christ, becoming like Christ.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.020]   Most of the time, the person who quote unquote wins
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.100]   the argument is usually the one who acts least like Jesus.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460]   And so we keep that in mind that,
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.180]   okay, God opposes the proud.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.800]   And so I could win this argument in a sense,
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.120]   but if I do it in arrogance,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.260]   now suddenly I've got God opposing me.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.420]   So what did I win?
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.520]   You know, I'm a loser at that point.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.620]   So it's like, okay, humble myself,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.460]   treat her like God's daughter,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.300]   and remember that, okay, we've got things to do
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.140]   for the kingdom.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.980]   We cannot waste our time arguing about things
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.340]   that are not eternal.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.780]   So let me humble myself.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.380]   If it's not a big deal, then just let it go.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.160]   Let her have her way.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.260]   There's more important things to focus on.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.460]   - Thank you, Francis.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.260]   We're gonna pick up our conversation next week
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.500]   because I have two more questions
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.780]   I'd love to get your thoughts on.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.380]   Specifically, how do you manage the time
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.400]   that your kids have with digital devices?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.880]   But next time I wanna hear from you
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.100]   about the growing trend of couples
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.840]   who are marrying later and later in life.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.960]   What do you think is the cause
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.620]   and what are the consequences of this trend?
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.400]   We'll tackle that one on Monday.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.120]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
