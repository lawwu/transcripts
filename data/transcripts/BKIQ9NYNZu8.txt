[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   Podcast listener Noah Giles writes in, "Pastor John, you've talked a lot about suffering
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.560]   and how to successfully trust God through the trials of life at its hardest.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.840]   But I also know there have been times in my life when I feel like things are good and
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.180]   even when I'm living out my faith, the only persecution I might get is when I'm silently
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.080]   judged or given a strange look.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.040]   Am I doing something wrong when I'm happy and content with life or are there things
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.560]   I should be wary of?
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560]   If I'm a Christian trying to glorify God, should I ever feel comfortable?"
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.960]   Hmm.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.800]   Well, Noah is right.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.960]   I have in my life and in my ministry put a lot of emphasis on suffering.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.880]   The reason is because of texts like these.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.120]   Through many tribulations, you must enter the kingdom of God.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.120]   No question.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   They're coming.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.280]   That's Acts 14.22.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.200]   Second Timothy 3.12, "All who desire to live a godly life in Christ will be persecuted."
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   Matthew 10.25, "If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.360]   malign those of his household?"
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.560]   First Peter 4.12, "Beloved, don't be surprised at the fiery trial that comes upon you to
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.800]   test you as though something strange were happening to you."
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.240]   John 16.33, "In the world you will have tribulation.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   Take heart.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.560]   I've overcome the world."
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.760]   Romans 8.17, "We are heirs of God, fellow heirs with Christ, if we suffer with him in
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.160]   order that we may be glorified with him."
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.840]   Luke 14.27, "Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple."
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.500]   And Hebrews 12.7, "It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000]   God is treating you as sons.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.540]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.560]   And on and on and on the text goes.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   You can see where I'm coming from and why I would make it such a dominant part of my
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.040]   writing and my speaking over the years.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.680]   I do see that God's calling on my life and somewhat on desiring God's life, the ministry,
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080]   to help people prepare to suffer.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.840]   Like it says in First Peter 4.19, "Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.720]   and trust their souls to a faithful creator while doing good."
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.000]   This is what Peter was doing.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.680]   I think all of First Peter is designed to help people get ready to suffer.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.080]   Now when you put as much emphasis on the sovereignty of God as I do, there is a certain burden
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.980]   you feel, I feel, to help people understand how this sovereignty is good news in suffering
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.520]   and not just in easy times.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   So that's all to say yes, he's right.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.940]   However, my answer to Noah is that he should find in Scripture a theology of contentment
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720]   in comfort as well as contentment in pain.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.840]   Yes, yes, yes, he should.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.240]   And if he hasn't found it yet, which it doesn't sound like he has, he should pursue.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.840]   And I'll try to give a little guideline here.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   That's exactly what Paul said in Philippians 4.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.800]   Not that I'm speaking of being in need, for I've learned in whatever situation I am to
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.720]   be content, I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.260]   That would be Noah's "Can I be okay feeling comfortable?"
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.020]   So go to school here, right?
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.800]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   and need.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.960]   I can do all things, both of those, through him who strengthens me.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.020]   So God does not intend for every moment of our lives to be equally hard.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.520]   Jesus said to his disciples, Mark 6 31, "Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.240]   rest a while."
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.080]   Well, if one of them had said, "Hey, aren't we supposed to suffer?
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.920]   Aren't we supposed to suffer following you?"
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.200]   I think Jesus would have said, "It'll come, it'll come.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Don't worry.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   Go ahead.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   I'm taking you away to enjoy some desert quietness right now and you'll get your chance to suffer."
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.120]   And so recently Tom Schreiner wrote an article at Desiring God called Stop and Enjoy the
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.960]   Ordinary.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   And let me read a line.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.920]   Ecclesiastes teaches us that life on earth is full of suffering and tragedy.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.720]   Okay, that's the first half of this little answer.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.380]   And yet at the same time, we are called upon to enjoy everyday life.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.480]   The call to enjoy life is persistent as a theme in Ecclesiastes, and he lists one, two,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.220]   three, four, five, six, seven, eight texts.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.940]   We find these words in chapter three, "I perceive that there is nothing better for human beings
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.460]   than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live, also that everyone should eat and
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.100]   drink and take pleasure in his toil.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.480]   This is God's gift to man," Ecclesiastes 3, 12, and 13.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:38.080]   So the challenge, the great challenge for all of us is to find a way in our hearts by
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.360]   the working of the Holy Spirit to weep with those who weep and to rejoice with those who
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.560]   rejoice even when they are virtually simultaneous.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.140]   No wedding should be ruined by the sorrow of those who attend, and no funeral should
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.500]   be desecrated by silly, humorous talk as if joy could have no tears.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.980]   This is not an easy task to find this in our hearts, but this is what we're called to do.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.100]   This is what I call Noah to discover.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.100]   Beautiful.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.060]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Noah.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.980]   To find the article by Tom Schreiner on Ecclesiastes, go to desiringgod.org and search for the title
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.740]   Stop and Enjoy the Ordinary.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.680]   So how do we engage culture and also swim against the stream of cultural influence in
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   our lives?
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.760]   John Piper returns tomorrow to answer that question from a listener.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.020]   And for everything related to this podcast, you need to know, go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
