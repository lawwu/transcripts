[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.340]   His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.760]   Really? So how do you know that if you were asleep?
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.520]   You're going to have to do better than that.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.020]   The lie proved the resurrection.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.040]   Jesus was raised.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.620]   Right at the end of this tremendous account about the resurrection comes the great what?
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.200]   Commission.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.580]   Is Jesus alive? Then go tell.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.140]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:01:05.400]   What is often overlooked in the glories of the cross and Good Friday
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.180]   and the glories of the resurrection on Sunday
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.920]   is what happened in between.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.020]   And that is the burial of our Lord.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.220]   Understanding His burial will elevate your confidence in everything else about that weekend.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.300]   His death and His resurrection.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.920]   It will elevate your confidence in the Scripture
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.300]   and in the sovereign power.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300]   And in the power of God.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   Now to give you the full story, I need to include all four gospels.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.300]   We're going to see what the gospels tell us about the burial of Jesus that is significant.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.300]   We're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the indifferent soldiers.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And then we're going to look at the burial from the vantage point of the loving saints.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.560]   And then we're going to look at the burial of Jesus from the vantage point of the apostate
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.240]   spiritual leaders.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   So we're going to get three perspectives on the burial of our Lord, and we'll see the
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.240]   providence of God at work.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.760]   First of all, divine providence in the action of the indifferent soldiers.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.860]   You can turn now in your Bible to John 19.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.560]   John 19, and we will begin at verse 30.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.860]   John 19, verse 30.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.880]   This is, as you know, the final statement of our Lord before He bows His head.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.420]   When He had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished."
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.420]   .
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.740]   And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit, having also said, "Father, into Your hands
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.500]   I commend My spirit."
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.400]   Then in verse 31, we pick up the subject for this morning.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.500]   Then the Jews, "Because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.980]   remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a high day.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.080]   asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.260]   So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man - "first thief" - and of the
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.280]   other who was crucified with Him.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.980]   But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.240]   But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   out.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.500]   "And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.800]   telling the truth, so that you also may believe.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture: 'Not a bone of him shall be broken.'"
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.960]   And again another Scripture says, "They shall live."
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   And they said, "They shall live."
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.200]   And it probably took a greater toll on their physicality, whereas there was no toll of
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.960]   sin on the physicality of Jesus.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.840]   And we would have expected Him to live a whole lot longer than one who had been burdened
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.200]   with the fallenness of Adam's sin, and then his own transgressions.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:30.500]   But Jesus died before even the thieves died.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.900]   All these three men hanging in the...
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.420]   sky that day outside Jerusalem needed to come down off the cross, and they needed to come
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.400]   down right then.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.200]   Why?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.820]   Because as you'll notice in verse 31, it was the day of preparation.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.720]   That's the day before the Sabbath.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.060]   That's Friday.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.840]   So that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:12.640]   The Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.840]   Why did they care whether those people were still hanging there on the Sabbath?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.080]   Well, it goes back to Deuteronomy, chapter 21.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.380]   Let me read you a couple of verses, verses 22 and 23: "If a man has committed a sin worthy
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.780]   of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, his corpse shall not hang
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.780]   all night on the tree.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.240]   But you shall surely bury him on the same day, for he who is hanged is accursed of God,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.920]   so that you do not defile your land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance."
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.200]   So God had given them the reality that if they had executed someone for a just cause,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.400]   they didn't leave that person hanging there until the next day.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.720]   Now this is even more significant when the next day is the Sabbath day.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:13.480]   They did not want three bodies hanging on crosses on the Sabbath day.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:19.900]   And this was not just any Sabbath, this was Passover.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.280]   And so all three would have desecrated the Sabbath.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:32.660]   They would have desecrated this Passover Sabbath if left on the cross, dead or alive.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.680]   To leave the bodies on the cross in the eyes of the Jewish leaders would have been to defile
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.140]   the land.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.560]   This is something of an insight into their hypocrisy.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.980]   They didn't want dead bodies defiling the land, even though one of those bodies belonged
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:57.080]   to the Son of God and the Messiah, whom they had sentenced to death.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   By the way, they had already had a conversation with Pilate, and at some point entered his
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:11.720]   praetorium, which would have defiled them for certain by their own ceremonial tradition
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   to enter into any Gentile place.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:24.120]   Familiar with crucifixion, they knew the way to speed it up was pretty simple.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:30.400]   Verse 31, "They asked Pilate to give them permission to break their legs."
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.540]   What they would do is take a mallet and smash it.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.900]   Smash the femur on each leg.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.440]   This is called crucifragium in the Latin.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.280]   It involved smashing the femur, the victim's legs, with an iron mallet.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.120]   And this gesture made death almost immediate because the body would slump and could no
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.420]   longer push itself up on the nails through the feet, and therefore get some breath, and
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.480]   they would asphyxiate rather rapidly, as well as the shock.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.840]   And the blood loss, the asphyxiation would take their lives very rapidly.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.420]   You'll notice the man's name is Pilate, who was the governor at that time, the procurator
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:23.060]   under Tiberius for a period from about 26 to 36 A.D., so through the time of the death
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.300]   of our Lord.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:32.420]   So they asked if they could break those femurs so those men would die before the day previous
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.320]   Sabbath was over.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.000]   And again, this was the day of preparation.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.280]   This is Friday, and it's important that these bodies be down off the cross to the Jews before
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:56.640]   the Sabbath begins, or on Friday, and that's important, and that they might at the end
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.820]   of verse 31 be taken away, removed.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.360]   "So the soldiers came.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.660]   They had been given the permission and broke the legs of the first man and of the other
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.720]   who was crucified with him.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:18.220]   But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they didn't break His legs.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.120]   But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   out."
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:32.000]   Now, it's important to recognize that these Roman soldiers were executioners by trade.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.300]   They knew who they were.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.260]   They knew who was dead and who wasn't.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.420]   They knew Jesus was dead.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:48.480]   And to demonstrate that, they pierced His side with a spear, and out came blood and
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.500]   water.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:12:02.240]   This is a mixture of blood and lymphatic fluid that could be the result of the cardiac episode.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:10.920]   Psalm 69 has references clearly to the cross, and one of them in verse 20 is that reproach
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   has broken my heart.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:24.480]   Could it have been that the cause of the Lord's death was that His heart just exploded?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.180]   So they found Him dead, and they didn't break His legs.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:41.580]   Verse 35 then tells us that John was there, the writer, and he saw it.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:48.540]   "And he who has seen has testified," - John meaning himself - "and his testimony is true,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:54.380]   and he knows that he is telling the truth so that you also may believe."
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.940]   John is saying, "I want you to know I was there, I was an eyewitness, and Jesus was
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.120]   dead."
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.100]   That was important.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.280]   Important because of two Old Testament prophecies.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:25.100]   Verse 36, the first one is from Exodus 12:46, Numbers 9:12, and even Psalm 34: "Not a bone
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.680]   of Him shall be broken."
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.060]   If He had not been dead, they would have...
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.920]   If He had violated that prophecy, He would not have fulfilled that prophecy.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:44.520]   He would not be the Messiah, and God not in control of everything.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:50.780]   Passover lamb, and the reason I refer back to Exodus and Numbers, Passover lamb could
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:58.900]   have no broken bone, a picture of the final lamb.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.000]   And another Scripture, verse 37, Zechariah 12:10.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.300]   "They shall look on Him whom they pierced."
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.520]   So it was prophesied that not a bone of Him would be broken, as is the case of the Passover
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.760]   lamb, and that they would look on Him, the Jews, one day in the future, Zechariah, saying,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.100]   "Whom they pierced."
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.400]   John says, "I was there.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.440]   Not a bone was broken, and He was pierced."
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.840]   That's the Bible.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.620]   So the action of not only our Lord giving up His life, but the action of the soldiers
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:44.520]   on the body of Christ were under divine control, and authenticate the Old Testament prophecies,
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.140]   authenticate the Messiahship of Jesus, set up the reality of His resurrection as the
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:58.580]   Son of God, and demonstrate the sovereign providence of God over every detail.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.780]   So as we come to the actual removal of the body from the cross.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.100]   And it's placement in the tomb.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.760]   I want you to turn to Mark 15.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.000]   Mark 15.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.680]   This is amazing.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:29.920]   Verse 42 of Mark 15, "When evening had already come," which means it's in the afternoon,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.720]   because it is the preparation day.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.900]   "When evening had already come," which means it's in the afternoon, because it is the morning,
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.900]   that is the day before the Sabbath.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.900]   So it's the day before the Sabbath.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.900]   The day before the Sabbath.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900]   It tells us this is Friday.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   That is the day before the Sabbath.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.820]   Some people try to say Jesus was crucified on Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.140]   No, it's the day before the Sabbath.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:54.760]   "Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the council, who himself was waiting for
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   the kingdom of God.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.840]   And he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:08.240]   Pilate wondered if he was dead by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   him as to whether he was already dead.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.980]   And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:24.440]   Joseph bought a linen cloth, took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.780]   in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a stone against the entrance
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.060]   of the tomb.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:41.960]   Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph were looking on to see where he was laid.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:48.120]   We go from divine providence in the action of the indifferent soldiers to divine providence
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.920]   in the action of loving saints.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.320]   And we meet Joseph of Arimathea.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.420]   Luke says this about him.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.720]   He was a good man.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.380]   He was a good and righteous man.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.060]   Same word used by the centurion to refer to Jesus.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.400]   Truly this man was righteous.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.360]   This man was the Son of God.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:23.180]   Just exactly what prompted Joseph to want his body and to have the privilege of burying
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.820]   it?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.140]   What is driving this man?
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.360]   Simply God.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.480]   He's compelled by God.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.740]   He's being driven by God.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:41.420]   He's moving at a divine speed, not just to give Jesus an honorable burial, a proper burial,
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:47.580]   not just to do it all with as much dignity as could possibly be remaining for that kind
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:56.980]   of condition, but rather he is moving on God's time to get Jesus in the grave on Friday because
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.300]   He has to be there three days.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:08.540]   Matthew 12:40, "The Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.800]   earth."
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.360]   And a day and a night constituted any part of the 24 hours.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:23.800]   So He took Him down, in verse 46, being compelled by God, but not even knowing it.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:33.300]   But He put, first of all, a linen cloth out, then took Him down and wrapped Him in the
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:39.780]   linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock; and He rolled
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:45.660]   a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.180]   Mark says He did it all Himself.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.280]   John says He took the body away Himself.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.780]   He carried it.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.080]   He buried His Savior.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:07.540]   Now none of the gospels say that Joseph had any spices, but John tells us they were brought
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:18.320]   by another person who just happened to show up with spices.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.760]   John 19:39.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.060]   We're back to 38, just to set the stage.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.080]   Joseph of Arimathea, disciple of Jesus, secret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.540]   he might take the body of Jesus.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   Pilate granted permission.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.100]   He came and took away His body.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:48.040]   Nicodemus, a familiar name, John 3, the teacher of Israel, who came to Jesus by night, also
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.640]   came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.600]   About a hundred and fifty.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:53.720]   About a hundred and fifty.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:53.740]   About a hundred and fifty.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.020]   About a hundred pound weight.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:04.860]   So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.340]   the burial custom of the Jews.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:18.020]   Somewhere between John 3 and John 19, somewhere between meeting Jesus the first time and seeing
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.480]   His dead body, Nicodemus had become a follower of Jesus.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.720]   He had been born again.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:41.320]   So that takes us back to Mark 15 again, and together now they lay Jesus in the tomb.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:50.000]   The spices are placed on Him, and He's put in the tomb, the tomb hewn out of rock.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.380]   Matthew 27:60 says it was Joseph's own tomb.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.440]   Matthew also calls Joseph a rich man.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:06.160]   John says, I think it's chapter 19, verse 42, that it was very near Golgotha, and they
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:16.680]   laid Him in a tomb, essentially, which no one had ever been laid in.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.880]   And then Joseph of Arimathea rolled a stone.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.680]   He rolled against the entrance of the tomb.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.340]   John 19:41 says this tomb was in a garden.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.360]   That's why it's called even today the Garden Tomb.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:37.240]   So we see the action of loving saints added to the action of indifferent soldiers, all
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.820]   demonstrating the action of God providentially as He has His Son buried on Friday.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.760]   And that brings us to the third group that play a role in this burial.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.980]   The indifferent soldiers and the loving saints, and then divine providence and the action
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.020]   of the hateful spiritual leaders.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:05.540]   And let's go back to where we started in reading Scripture, back to Matthew chapter 27, and
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.940]   we'll wrap it up.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:19.640]   Matthew chapter 27:62 is the verse: "On the next day," the day after the preparation,
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:25.760]   "the priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate and said, 'Sir, we remember that
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:35.660]   when he was still alive, that deceiver said, 'After three days I'm going to rise again.'"
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.020]   Now wait a minute.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.300]   The day after the preparation is the Sabbath.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.720]   What are they doing in a Gentile house on the Sabbath?
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.520]   What are they doing with Pilate?
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.440]   The conditions were very conveniently set aside because they're worried.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.500]   We remember that when he was still alive, that deceiver said, "After three days I am
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.340]   to rise again.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.600]   Therefore give orders for the grave to be made secure until the third day, otherwise
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.260]   His disciples may come and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.040]   the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.400]   Pilate said to them, "You have a guard.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   Go.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.160]   Be secure as you know how."
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.480]   And they went and made the grave secure, and along with the guard they set a seal on the
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   stone."
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:38.120]   We're going to make sure He never comes out of that grave.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:44.900]   They're going to make sure that there's not a worse deception than the deceiver Jesus
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.280]   alive by the disciples stealing His body.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.540]   So the grave was sealed.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:24:00.780]   Some people say Jesus wasn't dead on the cross, and that's why He came out of the grave.
