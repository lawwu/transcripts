[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   if you earn $100,000 in San Francisco as a family of four,
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.000]   you are below the poverty line, right?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   You know, the money is going to basically
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.560]   upper middle class Americans and upper class Americans
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.480]   who own tons of residential land,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.680]   and are basically, and also the old and the wealthy,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.560]   especially, are essentially this entire class
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.440]   of kind of hidden landed gentry that are extracting wealth
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.560]   from the most productive people in America
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.400]   and young people, especially.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   And it creates really weird patterns,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.560]   especially with like service workers
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.680]   who can't afford to live in the cities
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.280]   where their work is demanded.
