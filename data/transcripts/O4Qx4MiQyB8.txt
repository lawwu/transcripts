[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   This week we are talking with Rob Smith, a theologian who lectures in systematic
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   theology and ethics at Sydney Missionary and Bible College in Australia. He
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.600]   approaches the topic of the transgender revolution as a biblical theologian, as a
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   historian of the movement, and as a pastor whose own family has been touched
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.960]   by the realities and the tensions of gender dysphoria. Rob, we Christians hear
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   it all the time. Transgender is an issue of what someone wants to do with his or
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.600]   her own body. It's not abortion. It's not murder. It is the choice of a
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.640]   person who wants to change his or her own body. So what would you say to the
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.080]   transgender community that says to Christians, "Hey, leave us alone. If you
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.760]   think we're hurting ourselves, we're only hurting ourselves. So be it. What I do
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.480]   with my own body is none of your own business." What is the proper Christian
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.000]   response to that opposition? Yes, this is a great question that I guess is a
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.600]   challenging one for many. We are really told to back off. Even non-Christian
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.680]   friends of mine who, for example, just to jump over to the issue of same-sex
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.240]   marriage, who would say, "Look, I don't understand same-sex attraction and I'm
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.720]   not in favor of same-sex marriage, but who am I to, as it were, impose my
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.400]   view or stand in the way of what others would like to do?" And so similarly
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.320]   here, why not just let people do what they want to do? Now I guess one
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.920]   way of answering that is to say, "Well, we care about you. One of our love of our
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.840]   neighbors is to desire their good. And if you think somebody is acting against
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   their own self-interest, then we at least have, I think, a duty or
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.240]   responsibility to say something." Just as we have, I think, a duty and
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.500]   responsibility to do what we can to stop people self-harming, committing
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.560]   suicide or damaging themselves in some way. Of course, we do it
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.600]   with all kinds of other things. I was looking at big adverts yesterday on
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   the side of a bus saying, "Smoking causes cancer and smoking kills."
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.720]   There we are warning people not to engage in activity, even though it
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   doesn't seem to stop some. So it is part of loving our neighbor to speak up.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.840]   But I think the other thing perhaps to ponder is that when a person hurts
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.160]   themselves, it does hurt others. It hurts those who love them. It affects their
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.800]   relationships. And again, I've certainly seen this with people who have, I
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   guess, tried to resolve their gender dysphoria by transitioning. It puts, well,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.920]   enormous strain on relationships, if not in some cases destroys them and tears
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.160]   families apart. And I guess what's at the heart of that is you're watching
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.840]   someone you love go through, well, basically self-mutilation in an attempt
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.560]   to destroy the person that they were and replace that person with someone else,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   with another name. And that has a profound impact on relationships. Now, it
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.720]   doesn't have to destroy them. And certainly in many cases where Christian
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.880]   people have hung in there and walked alongside those who've made some of
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   these choices and said, "We don't agree, but we're not going anywhere. We're going
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.320]   to keep loving you and reaching out to you, and we want to be there to care for
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.480]   you. But we still think what you're doing to yourself is actually tragic,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   and may well be something you come to later regret." And that's, I guess, a
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.280]   thing we ought to be aware of, that the instance of regret is astronomically
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   high. And of course, those who take these radical steps of sex reassignment
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   surgery, well, there's just so much that cannot then be undone. You know, once
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.200]   things have been cut off, they can't be put back on again. And it's
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.640]   heartbreaking to see. So I guess that's how I would respond to that.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.480]   Obviously, there are certain freedoms people have, and we can't in the end stop
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.640]   people who are of age making use of these sorts of things that are
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   available to them, which of course raises another question, but they should be
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.960]   available to them. But that's a harder question to answer, and
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.240]   perhaps that genie's out of the bottle, sadly. Yeah, I mean, we've sped right
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.640]   past the ethical medical question about breaking healthy bodies. But I'm thinking
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.840]   now of my next question. This is certainly not true of you, but what do
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.080]   you say to critics of Christians who imply that if you don't have a personal
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.520]   network of close transgender friends, you have no basis on which to oppose the
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   transgender revolution? Does that question make sense? Yeah, it does,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.840]   and it's, I guess, again, a common challenge that's put to Christians on a
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   range of fronts. And of course, not all of us do or can have transgender
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   friends. You don't just go out and decide, "I'm going to get some transgender
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.920]   friends now." Those of us who do know transgender people, that's something
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.040]   that's just sort of happened under God's providence in life. Now, obviously, if
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   you do know those who are either suffering gender dysphoria or sought to
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.720]   transition from one gender to another, then that will perhaps give you a
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.760]   certain insight into, again, the distress at the heart of gender dysphoria and
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.440]   why some people feel driven to resolve that distress this way. But even if
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.480]   you don't have those relationships, we all have the capacity to read and
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.140]   understand and to develop insight and compassion and have enough of a
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.880]   grasp of issues to speak to them and to raise our questions about them in
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.760]   an appropriate way, oppose them. So, yeah, look, again, I think it's just a way
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.080]   of trying to silence any objection, I think, to come at things this way.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.240]   But it does, I suppose, put the onus on Christians to at least get as good a
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   grasp on things as we can, whether or not we actually have personal contact or
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.480]   connection with transgender friends. And one of the things, of course, it's
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.040]   good to do. I mean, if a person really wants to understand these issues better
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   than they've never, ever spoken to a transgender person, well, there are
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.240]   obviously ways of making contact with people or asking a friend of a
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.960]   friend and say, "Look, I'd just like to sit down and hear your story and
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   understand what it's like to be you and how you got to where you got to and
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.960]   just listen." That itself can be a useful thing to do, not as a way of just
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   changing your view. And sadly, I think, I guess this is one of the ways that, again,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:41.120]   Christians can be silenced or have our views muzzled. It's by saying, "Look,
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.240]   who are you to deny my story? Or if you listen to my story, then
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.680]   that will cause you to back off." Well, I think, no, we need to listen to
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.760]   stories and make sense of those stories in the light of Scripture, and where
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.480]   appropriate, respond and advise or what have you.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.720]   Yeah, tough love. And with tough love, I think you bring a very warm pastoral
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.960]   tone whenever you talk about this issue, as listeners, I think, can tell in this
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.200]   conversation. This is true of your lectures as well. I want to commend you
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.320]   for that. Well, thank you. Yes, certainly. I mean, tone is huge because Christians
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.520]   engage in what seems to be two different conversations. So keep talking about this.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.000]   How do we as Christians winsomely confront the profits of transgender
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.540]   revolution in our culture, especially in the political realm, while not alienating
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:39.360]   those who are more quietly wrestling with transgender impulses and loving
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.000]   them pastorally? How do we pull both of these things off well? Yeah, this is one
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.600]   of the challenges because we're not dealing with a one-size-fits-all
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   situation. We've got, on the one hand, you've got advocates,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.640]   activists, ideologues, experimenters who are really determined to
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.520]   reconstruct society and deconstruct gender and destroy the concept of a
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.440]   gender binary. That's a dangerous ideology, I think. It's
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.560]   already reaping havoc in Western society. And so, yeah, that does
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.880]   need to be challenged. It does need to be opposed. Of course, anything we challenge
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.600]   or oppose, we need to do that with, as Paul says, with graciousness
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.640]   and seasoned with salt and, as Peter says, with gentleness and respect. So we need
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:43.200]   to engage with civility and we need to know what we're talking about. We've got
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.440]   to be careful we don't overstate and overreach. We need to be on top of
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.280]   sometimes facts and figures and if we're going to engage meaningfully and
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.880]   helpfully. So there's a whole manner of engagement there, but we need to engage.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   Now, on the other hand, of course, you've got the pastoral context that you
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.360]   mentioned, people who are genuine sufferers with whom we are trying to
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.840]   build relationships and provide love and care and support and
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.760]   what have you. And so, yeah, juggling those two things is not always easy.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:25.160]   And, well, just to perhaps give you a little personal insight, I suppose, you know,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.920]   sometimes when my wife and I have spoken publicly on these issues in a certain
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.880]   forum and we've wondered whether people we're talking to personally might become
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:43.360]   aware of that lecture or even listen to it, we've sort of given them a
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.680]   heads-up on that and said, "Look, we just want you to know we're going to be
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.920]   speaking about these issues just so there's no surprise there." I suppose
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.800]   even just to think in terms of, say, a pastor who decides to preach on this.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.960]   He's got somebody he knows in the congregation with whom he's already in
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.840]   conversation who is struggling with agendas for a very right and appropriate
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.760]   to go to them beforehand and say, "Listen, I'm going to be preaching about this on
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.480]   Sunday. This is not a way of getting at you. It's not my way
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.320]   of trying to say things to you that I'm too afraid to say to you face to face.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.240]   This is for the benefit of the congregation, and so I just want you to
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.360]   know that up front." Again, there are ways, I guess, of just managing that
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.080]   tension between saying what some may perceive as harder things in a
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:40.120]   public sphere and softer things in a private context. But at the end of the
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.200]   day, the truth is the truth. Our message is the same, and I guess our
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.040]   political engagement and pastoral practice can't be two completely
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.800]   separate things. It's the same understanding that's generating both.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   It's the common love of neighbor that is generating both. It's a
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.920]   concern for individuals and society that's generating both. So I think you
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.120]   can juggle, but yeah, I think we just got to work with that tension.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.280]   Yeah, we sure do. Thank you, Rob. Rob will join us again tomorrow, and we will
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.440]   tackle a very somber topic in this discussion, and it concerns the high
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   suicide rates among transgender folks who feel the brokenness of life,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.040]   especially painfully. So do sex change operations curtail suicide rates, and
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.760]   what do the stats say? There are seasons when this podcast is heavy. This is one
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.520]   of them. But thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest
