[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Austin Fisher is the author of a new book titled
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.640]   Young, Restless, No Longer Reformed.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.080]   It's a book-length critique of you, Pastor John,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840]   and Jonathan Edwards, and neo-Calvinism.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.960]   And on his blog recently, Kevin DeYoung
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.640]   has written a fairly lengthy review,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.200]   so there's no need to do an in-depth review
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.720]   of the book here, but there is something in the book,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.400]   a specific critique of you that I want you to address
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400]   here on Ask Pastor John, and it comes on page 58
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.040]   of his book, where Fisher says your emphasis
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.580]   on God's glory negates a proper emphasis on God's love.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.600]   He says that you've made God into a needy,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.540]   glory-monger, trying to suck praise out of us,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.040]   and this, he says, has shrouded the beauty
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340]   of God's self-giving, his love to us.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920]   In Fisher's own words, he says this, quote,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.260]   "God's love is an end in itself."
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.480]   And here I find a radical departure
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.560]   from Jonathan Edwards, John Piper,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.000]   and the self-glorifying black hole of neo-Calvinism.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.280]   Edwards claimed that the ultimate aim of God
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.440]   in creating the world was the full manifestation
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.760]   of his glory, i.e. his self-glorification.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.600]   Love is just a cog in the bigger glory machine, end quote.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.660]   Pastor John, how do you respond to this type of criticism?
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.440]   - Well, first of all, Tony, thanks for the question.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.720]   I am reading the book, I have it here in front of me.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280]   I don't know that I'll read the whole thing,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.240]   and people will see why.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.320]   I might not finish it before I'm done here,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.120]   but let me start with that phrase,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   the self-glorifying black hole of the neo-Calvinism,
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.200]   which I suppose I would represent
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.640]   even though I'm an old guy.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   That phrase, self-glorifying black hole,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.800]   implies that God is like a cosmic vacuum cleaner,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.440]   I suppose, with endless need.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   And guess what it's implying?
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   Because later, Fisher says, quote,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   "God doesn't love us in order to take something from us,"
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.880]   glory, worship, praise, like he's a vacuum cleaner
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.440]   sucking up glory, worship, praise,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.360]   and they're all disappearing into a black hole.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.800]   "God doesn't love us in order to take something from us.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.280]   That's what needy, greedy human loved us."
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   So he's portraying Jonathan Edwards' view
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.200]   of God's pursuit of his glory
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   as like needy, greedy human vacuum cleaners do,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   black holes do.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.180]   Now, Tony, that is absolutely an appalling
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.380]   misrepresentation of Jonathan Edwards.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.840]   I mean, he should be ashamed of that.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.740]   To give the impression that Edwards' massive vision
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.460]   of the end for which God created the world
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.160]   teaches that God as needy or taking,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   like a greedy human is either ignorance
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.940]   on his part or deceitful.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.000]   Over and over, Edwards stresses
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.980]   that God's self-glorification
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.840]   and self-communication are one.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.460]   Here's a couple of quotes.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.640]   I just read these recently from a sermon
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.320]   that was published in the Yale edition.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.100]   "God's end," this is Edwards,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.680]   "God's end in the creation of the world
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.820]   consists in these two things,
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.820]   to communicate himself and to glorify himself.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.880]   God created the world to communicate himself
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.400]   not to receive anything."
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.200]   Okay, that's the way Edwards talks.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.540]   Here's another one.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.100]   "These two things ought not to be separated
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.960]   when we speak of God's end in the creation of the world.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.040]   Indeed, God's communicating himself," that's one,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   "and glorifying himself," that's two,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.920]   "ought not to be looked upon
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   as though they were two distinct ends,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.000]   but as what together makes one last end,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.040]   as glorifying God and enjoying God
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   make one chief end of man.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.600]   For God glorifies himself in communicating himself,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.500]   and he communicates himself in glorifying himself."
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.100]   That's end quote from Edwards.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.120]   So what Edwards teaches, and what I teach,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480]   and what we see in the Bible,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.360]   is that God seeks to magnify and display
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.540]   and uphold his glory, that is,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.540]   the fullness of the beauty of his manifold perfections
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.940]   in all things, and he does this
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.360]   in communicating himself to his creatures
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.080]   for their enjoyment, and in their enjoyment,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   they are glorifying him.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   That's what we teach.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.600]   That's what Edwards taught.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.640]   In our receiving, receiving, receiving, receiving,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.800]   not dumping and dumping onto God,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.840]   but in our receiving more and more of God
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.720]   as he communicates more and more of himself,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.800]   we receive it with joy in it,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   and our joy, Edwards teaches so explicitly,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.660]   is the glorifying of God,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.760]   so that all this talk about God being a black hole,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.820]   or God being this cosmic vacuum cleaner,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.520]   or God taking and taking and being greedy like a man
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.360]   is simply ridiculous misrepresentation
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.680]   of everything Edwards taught.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.960]   We glorify God precisely by receiving.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600]   I just read this morning, Psalm 50,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   where God gets on the case of his people
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.400]   by making sacrifices because he says,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.440]   "I don't eat the meat of bulls,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.900]   "or drink the blood of goats.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.740]   "I own the cattle on a thousand hills.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.620]   "Call upon me in the day of trouble.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.120]   "I will deliver you, and you will glorify me."
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   That's exactly what Edwards is saying.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   God gets glory.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.760]   You will glorify me when I meet your needs,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.460]   not you meet my needs.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.520]   So to this representation of a black hole thing
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.920]   is really an unworthy kind of misrepresentation.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.640]   But here's another problem, probably a deeper problem,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.760]   a methodological problem.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.680]   It appears that the objections
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.160]   that are in that part you read and others to Edwards
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.300]   is owing to an approach to the Bible
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.920]   that speaks in generalities
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.820]   and hovers above the biblical text
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.100]   rather than pressing down into the warp and woof
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.300]   that make the fabric of meaning what it is.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.480]   So maybe I could get at this
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.560]   by just a couple of textual examples,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.040]   and then we'll have to let it go
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.960]   because the limitations on this.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.060]   Let's just take two texts.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.140]   One, Romans 15, eight and nine.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.520]   "I tell you that Christ became a servant
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.980]   "to the circumcised in order that,"
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.140]   I'm skipping over a phrase,
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.900]   just jumping straight to the "in order that,"
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.620]   "in order that the Gentiles might glorify God
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.780]   "for his mercy."
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.620]   Okay, now, what's the inner textual logic
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.860]   of the relationship between mercy,
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.780]   which is a form of love, and glorifying God?
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.780]   And the answer is, he sent Christ to serve us,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.460]   and in serving us, he showed us mercy,
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.620]   and in showing us mercy, he does it, quote,
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.620]   "in order that we might glorify God for his mercy."
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.460]   Now, to argue against the fact that God loves us
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.740]   in order to be glorified for his loving us
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.660]   is clearly contrary to this text,
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.060]   and that's the kind of thing I hear.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.500]   Those generalized statements that love is an end in itself
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.180]   and therefore cannot be performed by God
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.140]   as a means for himself to be glorified.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.540]   That's contrary, the opposite of what that text says,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.620]   even though I would go back and say,
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.660]   the glory that God gets is precisely
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.660]   in our enjoying the love that he shows us.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.580]   It's not like they're two separate things.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.060]   Here's a second text, last one.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.260]   This is Romans 9, 22 to 23.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.420]   "What if God, desiring to show his wrath,"
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.580]   desiring to show his wrath,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.300]   "and to make known his power,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.220]   has endured with much patience
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.360]   the vessels prepared for destruction,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   in order to make known the riches of his glory
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.060]   for the vessels of mercy,
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.260]   which he has prepared beforehand for glory?"
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.260]   Now, God's wrath and God's power are in this text,
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.020]   and he is desiring to show them,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.420]   and he's doing it in order to make known
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.820]   the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.860]   In other words, in order to display more fully
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.180]   and enhance our experience more deeply
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.980]   of his arriving mercy.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.220]   So mercy and love are the end or goal
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.060]   of God's holy wrath,
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.840]   and just wrath on some.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.340]   It's a means of maximizing the glory
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.100]   of undeserved mercy to others.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.700]   So when Miroslav Volf says,
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.540]   "We don't have to give up on the idea
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.560]   that God seeks God's own glory.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.140]   We just need to say that God's glory,
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.820]   which is God's very being, is God's love,"
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.820]   I want to ask, "Is he allowing for what Paul says?"
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.800]   That God not only shows love, but wrath.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.720]   And in such a way, he shows wrath in such a way
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   that it's more loving to show wrath
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.260]   so that the vessels of mercy
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.660]   experience their mercy more deeply.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.240]   Does he get into the warp and woof
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.920]   of the logic of the apostolic word enough
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.900]   to stop talking in just mere generalities
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.900]   about God's love being a giver,
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.760]   which would leave you thinking,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.880]   "Well, I guess there's no place for hell then."
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.800]   Well, there is, and hell or wrath or power behind wrath
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   are, Paul says, "In order to make known
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.200]   the riches of his glory to the vessels of mercy."
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.000]   So my concluding point there methodologically
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.880]   is to simply say, "Let's get down into the threads
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.520]   of the texts and see how they are woven together
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.720]   to make the meaning of the Bible."
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   - That's very rich, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.560]   And one book that gets to the heart of God's love and glory
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.680]   is a book by Jonathan Edwards and by you, Pastor John.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.620]   It's titled "God's Passion for His Glory,"
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.080]   which includes the full text of Edwards' foundational book,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.800]   "The End For Which God Created the World."
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.840]   Pastor John, you wrote the first 100 pages,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   and then Jonathan Edwards wrote the last 150 pages,
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.920]   in a sense.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.440]   It's not an easy book to read, but it is essential
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.480]   if you wanna look into these themes with greater depth,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.460]   and you'll find almost 400 mentions of love in the book,
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.040]   showing just how important love is for understanding
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.080]   the ultimate purpose behind God's act of creation.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.280]   And because we have such faithful donors
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.840]   supporting the ministry, you can download the entire book
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.640]   free of charge at desiringgod.org,

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.960]   "God's Passion for His Glory."
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.360]   We will return Monday.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.320]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.600]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
