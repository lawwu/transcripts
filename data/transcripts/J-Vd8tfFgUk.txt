[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Several related email questions have come in from something you said in a podcast addressing
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.600]   John MacArthur and his strange fire conference.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.400]   Eric writes in to ask, "Pastor John, you stated at the end of episode 216 that a lack of emotions
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   may be worse than too much emotion when discussing charismatic abuses.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.040]   Can you explain why?"
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.960]   Nick from Sanford, Florida asks more generally, "Pastor John, what is the proper role of emotions
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.440]   in the Christian life?"
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.960]   And Kathy in South Dakota asks, "Pastor John, can you expand on your comment at the end
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.200]   of episode 216 about the absence of emotion being more deadly than the excess?"
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   I am super pleased that those listeners picked up on that comment.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.920]   I wanted to say more about that because I felt like I dropped that in there.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.040]   I think, "Is anybody going to get this?"
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.160]   I mean, this is important.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:05.400]   I think too few people make the observation that non-emotion is more dangerous than excessive
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960]   emotion.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.440]   Many see emotionalism and condemn it rightly, all right, rightly.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.000]   That is, emotion—here's my definition of emotionalism—emotion that is not rooted
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.360]   in truth and is not proportional to the truth that's in view and is not regulated by truth.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.240]   So as soon as emotion gets disconnected from biblical truth and the mental grasp of that
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:43.800]   truth, it spins out of control into emotionalism, and that is rightly criticized.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.920]   So we see that, and we recognize that because it's usually weird, right?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.760]   It usually gets on TV, and it's over the top, and people make spoofs of it with Benny
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hinn wielding a lightsaber and that sort of thing.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.360]   So we know that that is a problem, but too few see the dangers of the absence of emotion.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.120]   They think that this is more or less safe and normal and not very vulnerable to error
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.260]   and destruction.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.340]   But stop and think about it.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.120]   How many warnings are there in Scripture of being too glad in God?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.500]   Not many.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.040]   How many commands are there to be glad in God, really glad in God, exceedingly, like
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.600]   leaping like a lamb from the stall, and great is the Lord and greatly to be praised?
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.760]   How many of those are there?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.440]   Well, dozens and dozens and dozens.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.760]   Very few warnings about excessive rejoicing in the Bible.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640]   Very, very few.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.340]   Lots of commands to get your heart up high in affections for God.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.560]   And there are warnings about worshiping God with your lips and not with your heart.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.320]   Matthew 15, 8.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.300]   They worship Him in vain.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:21.840]   And that means that the absence of heart engagement is deadly as far as Jesus is concerned.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.400]   And I know Paul said, "Be babes in evil, in your thinking be mature," to which I say,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.120]   yes, yes, yes, yes, in your thinking be mature.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.660]   I love thinking.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.180]   We started schools.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.700]   I write books.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.640]   We try to think clearly about God.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.800]   But there's nothing in the Bible that says right thinking must or should be associated
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.560]   with weak or low muffled emotions.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.320]   That's a cultural connection that ought to be destroyed.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.000]   High, clear, rigorous, logical thinking about the things of God produces low emotions.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Baloney.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.440]   It doesn't.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.840]   It mustn't.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.920]   So in answer to the question, the proper role of emotion is that spiritual emotions are
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.760]   essential to pleasing God.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.880]   And here's what I mean by spiritual emotions.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.280]   I mean spiritual affections, the lively actings of the will, not the physical concomitants.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   Let me clarify.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.880]   Fluttering eyelashes, wobbly knees, sweaty palms, quickened heart rate, short breath,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   warm to the touch, like if you're praying for somebody's healing and your hand gets
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.520]   warm, uncontrollable laughter, collapsing, etc.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520]   All these things.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.680]   But these are not what I mean by spiritual emotions.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.360]   They're merely physical reflexes that have no necessary spiritual significance at all.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.560]   What I mean by spiritual emotions that count are the spiritual affections that are awakened
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.580]   by the Holy Spirit in response to God's Word and God's work.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.640]   They're rooted in the Gospel.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.720]   They're carried and enhanced by truth.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.960]   They may be mild and quiet, or they may be intense and loud.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.700]   They are what the heart was made by God to experience.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.060]   This is what I say is essential to Christian living.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.360]   Not to have these spiritual affections is to be dead.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.800]   And to be dead is to be lost, and that's serious.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   We are to love God with all our heart, not just all our mind.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   We're commanded in the Bible, "Rejoice, fear, hope, be satisfied, be tenderhearted, be thankful,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.560]   hate, be sorrowful, weep with those who weep."
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.760]   These are all spiritual emotions, and they're all commanded.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.280]   They're not decisions of the will.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.560]   None of those are.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   They're all events of the heart that rise because a person has been touched by something
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480]   in the truth by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.640]   And they're not optional.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   It's not optional to be an ungrateful Christian.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.480]   You can't be an ungrateful Christian.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.520]   If you're an ungrateful Christian, you're dead.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.040]   Christian has the affection, the emotion of gratitude welling up in his heart.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.440]   So the psalmists cry out repeatedly for God to awaken and sustain their emotions.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.600]   Now, I just wonder, how many people do that?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.200]   Do they cry out, "God, give me joy.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.140]   Give me the right sense of gratitude.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.800]   Give me the right tenderness.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   Grant me these fruits of affections."
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   They are so crucial.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.000]   I've argued, I mean, most of my life is devoted to arguing, that the manifestation of the glory
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.600]   of God is at stake in this because God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.800]   in him.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   You show what your treasure is by what you take most pleasure in.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.200]   Let me say that again because this is really radical.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.100]   It's devastating to a lot of people.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:18.260]   You show what your treasure is by what you take most pleasure in, either God or something
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.000]   he made, which is idolatry.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.120]   Christians are not icing on the cake of Christian duty.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.760]   They are at the heart of the faith because faith is coming to Jesus to have your heart
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   satisfied in him and all God is for us in him.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   So that's the place that they have and how important they are, which is why I wrote the
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   book "When I Don't Desire God, How to Fight for Joy" because I know most people, when
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.240]   they hear this, they feel discouraged because they say, "Whoa, if emotions and spiritual
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.600]   affections are that important, I'm a goner."
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.720]   And I want to say, "Well, join the club.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.600]   It does feel like we're goners because we all fail to measure up to the kind of intensity
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.380]   God is worthy of."
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.920]   So if you're concerned about that, I would recommend "When I Don't Desire God" that I
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.080]   tried to write for people like us.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   Now, you asked one other question, I think.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.160]   Why is the absence of emotion so deadly, more deadly than the excess?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.360]   Because I said that in that podcast.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.760]   Well consider this.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:38.520]   If you follow the course or the pathway from evangelical faith to liberalism, say a person
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   starts in a good solid church and he winds up a liberal who doesn't believe the Bible
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:51.720]   anymore or becomes a skeptic, agnostic, secularist, atheist, is that pathway that he has taken
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:09:01.080]   usually accompanied by people with intensified religious emotions or the death of religious
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.280]   emotions?
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:12.160]   And my answer is that most unbelieving liberal churches are not filled with emotion.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.920]   And therefore, where we get the idea that emotion is a greater danger to the Christian
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:25.040]   faith than the absence of emotion is mind-bogglingly unintelligible to me.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.920]   Are university classrooms where the faith is debunked filled with faculty who are excessively
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.040]   emotional about biblical things?
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.560]   "Oh, give me a break!"
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.080]   Or do they scoff at spiritual emotion?
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.160]   These are the real killers in our culture.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.480]   These are the people that are destroying faith in our young people.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.680]   They're not people who are over-the-top emotional about Jesus because they love Jesus so much
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.760]   they do weird things.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.640]   These are people who are scoffing at emotion.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.720]   So I would venture to say that millions more people perish in dead, emotionless churches
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.440]   than in churches that are excessively emotional.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.080]   Here's my counter-statement to strange fire.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:21.680]   Therefore, my crusade—closing admonition—my crusade is not to throw a damper on emotion
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:29.560]   when I find it in a church, even find it excessive, but to lift up a clear, robust, intellectually
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.880]   responsible biblical vision of the sovereignty of the grace of God, with all of its radical
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   implications of God's absolute control.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.920]   And what effect that has is separate the sheep and the goats really quick among the emotional
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.140]   people.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.440]   The super-duper emotional people who are born of God, they hear it and they say, "Amen!
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   Amen!"
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.440]   And they get more excited because God is sovereign and powerful.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.720]   And those that are just there for the trip or the money or the influence, they hear the
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.000]   truth and they don't hear the shepherd.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.280]   The sheep hear the shepherd and they follow and they bleat all the louder.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.360]   And the goats, they wander off to find something else to be excited about.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:22.720]   So I say let's focus on proclaiming and teaching truth, not berating emotional people.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
