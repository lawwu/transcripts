[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Good Monday morning everyone.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.640]   Well we are Christian Hedonists and that's something we have dedicated several episodes
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.000]   to explaining on the podcast.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   You can look back, for example, on APJ's 958, 1201, and 1281, for example.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.480]   And for those of you who want to teach this glorious truth, how do we take Christian Hedonism
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.840]   and make it our own?
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.480]   Or even more broadly asked, how do any of us take the key teachings of others and incorporate
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600]   them into our ministry so that we're not simply mimicking our teachers?
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.280]   That's an important question faced by any budding Christian communicator, writer, teacher,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280]   or preacher.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.800]   And it's a question today in the inbox.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.620]   Dear Tony and Pastor John, hello to you both.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.960]   My name is Gabriel, an international student studying in Australia.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   And I praise God for your ministry and for the realities you have pointed to in the Bible,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.080]   especially in opening my eyes to the connection between our joy and God's sovereign glory.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.680]   My question is this.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   How do I make Christian Hedonism my own, especially when it comes to teaching?
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.440]   I'm young, but I hope to teach one day, maybe even preach the word.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.560]   But I often find that I'm checking myself to see if I'm simply copying what you, Pastor
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.000]   John, say.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720]   I see that the realities are there in the text and in the Bible, but your ministry is
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   so thorough and wholesome, I almost feel I can't say anything without echoing you.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.920]   Perhaps I think incorrectly.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.360]   How can we carry on encouraging, teaching, preaching this reality in our own voice?
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   I'd be honored to hear your thoughts.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   Gabriel's question touches on a tension that every teacher feels when he has found something
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   true and precious in God's word and desires that it be seen and loved by others and that
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.640]   those others, generation after generation, preserve and pass on the truth and the preciousness
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.480]   of the reality that he has seen.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.920]   And the tension is this.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.160]   On the one hand, we want the very thing we have seen in Scripture to be preserved and
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.280]   not distorted or corrupted or lost.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.240]   And on the other hand, we know that if it is to be preserved for generations, the people
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:44.320]   that preserve it must have a grasp of it that is deeper than simply imitating the words
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.840]   of those who taught them the reality, showed them the reality.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.560]   So there's a tension between holding fast to what is fixed and having freedom to give
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   fresh and vital expression and application to that fixed reality.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   So Gabriel has discovered the truth and the beauty of what we call Christian hedonism,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:21.000]   namely the thought and the life that flow from the truth that God is most glorified
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.880]   in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:34.440]   And as he grows in his understanding and seeks to share with others what he's seen, he finds
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   himself sounding like his teacher, like me in particular.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   And he wonders if there are steps he can take so that he isn't what I call, he didn't use
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   this language, this is my language, what I would call a second-hander, a mimic.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.940]   We don't want him to be that.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.440]   He doesn't want to be that.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.680]   Now, what would I point out to Gabriel first if he's going to be helped beyond being a
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.720]   second-hander?
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   What I would point out to Gabriel first is that he's probably at a particular point in
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:26.020]   an inevitable process that moves from discovery through imitation, through the maturity of
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.060]   creative expression, and onto more and more discovery and so on.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:41.740]   So his question is really, I think, how can I move along in a natural process that I'm
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.740]   in?
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.340]   Let me use an analogy.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.380]   Compare the mystery and the wonder of how little tiny children learn language.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.180]   The first thing they do is listen, look, and feel.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.980]   Listen, look, and feel.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.180]   So you get this two-week-old baby, listen, look, feel, with some very uncreative crying
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.380]   to express his inarticulate desires.
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.700]   And then one day, they echo back, "Mama, dada."
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:26.140]   You're just burst with thrill that they made the connection between the reality of a person
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.260]   and a word coming out of their mouth, "Mama, dada."
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.120]   And all of it right now is simply imitation, echoing, copying.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.740]   But oh, how real it is, right?
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.740]   It's real.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.640]   You don't say, "Oh, he's just copying me."
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.020]   This is an awesome point in his development.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.860]   And then within a year or so, an absolutely astonishing thing happens.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:08.300]   All of the reality that this baby has been processing quietly, eyes, ears, touch, suddenly
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:20.140]   comes together miraculously, it seems, in his mind, and out comes a sentence, two words,
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:30.700]   three words, which that baby put together out of his own little head, imitating nobody.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.780]   Nobody had just spoken that sentence to him.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.060]   It emerged out of his own mind, absolutely amazing.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:48.740]   And the rest of their lives, they'll be turning observed and desired reality into sentences,
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.580]   some of which have never been spoken in the history of the world.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.940]   Amazing.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:02.620]   Now that pattern of listening, then echoing, then creating, and ongoing discovery is the
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.020]   way we learn for the rest of our lives.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:14.420]   So my first piece of advice for Gabriel is don't begrudge a season of discovery and imitation.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.220]   When someone helps you see a reality that you hadn't seen before, it is inevitable that
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.900]   you will describe the reality in the words of the one who helped you see it.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   That's normal.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.540]   It's good.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:37.020]   But you are right to be concerned that you should not remain in this early phase of understanding
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.340]   and expression.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:47.140]   So how do you move on to find your own voice and not lose the reality?
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:56.340]   So my second piece of advice is that you practice pressing through language to reality, that
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:03.340]   you never settle for mere words, not my words, not even Bible words.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:11.340]   When the Bible speaks, uses words, you press into those words and through those words to
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:18.740]   the reality, the reality of love, the reality of joy, the reality of faith, the reality
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.540]   of Christ, the reality of God.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.660]   These are not mere words.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:32.800]   This is the rock bottom necessity of not remaining a child or a second hander.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.740]   Have you tasted the reality expressed in the words of your teacher or the scriptures?
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.420]   That's what everyone should ask.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.460]   Have I tasted the reality or is it just words?
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:53.740]   Before you can find your authentic voice, you must have an authentic experience of what
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.500]   you are trying to give voice to.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.540]   This is a matter of earnest prayer, earnest study.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:11.220]   "Oh Lord, open my eyes that I may behold reality, wonderful things out of your word."
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.700]   The third piece of advice I would give is that you not only press through your teacher's
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:27.780]   words to that reality, but that you be constantly on the lookout in Scripture for more reality,
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:34.300]   realities that when they are brought together with the reality of Christian hedonism will
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:43.500]   cause you to see it in fresh light and the diamond will reveal more of its facets than
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:50.420]   you knew existed, perhaps even more than your teacher has ever seen.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:10:01.220]   And the fourth piece of advice I would give is make a studied effort to find fresh, faithful,
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:08.420]   compelling, culturally appropriate language to describe the reality that you have come
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.060]   to love.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:20.100]   This studied effort at creative expression will almost certainly go off the rails if
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:29.220]   the biblical reality is not clearly seen and firmly rooted in Scripture and gladly embraced
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.660]   with your heart and your mind.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:38.800]   Without this, the effort at creativity will almost certainly degenerate into creating
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.660]   new reality rather than new expressions of old, unchanging reality.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:57.180]   Fourth piece of advice I would give is that none of us be put off by old, tried and true
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.860]   expressions of reality.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:08.520]   That is, we shouldn't feel the need to always be saying things in new ways as if old ways
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.940]   are inevitably inadequate.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:20.300]   Some of the language describing a wonderful reality is so rooted in Scripture and so well
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:28.180]   suited to the reality and so compelling in its application that it shouldn't be left
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.940]   behind just because it's been around for a long time.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:39.460]   "Delight yourself in the Lord" has been around for 3,000 years, Psalm 37, 4.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:45.260]   "Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love" has been around for 3,000 years, Psalm
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.100]   90, 14.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:53.500]   We have this treasure, treasure in earthen vessels has been around for 2,000 years, 2
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.900]   Corinthians 4, 7.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.300]   "Rejoice in the Lord" and again I say rejoice has been around 2,000 years.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:06.260]   "In your presence is fullness of joy, at your right hand are pleasures forevermore"
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.420]   that's been around for 3,000 years.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.340]   These aren't John Piper's words.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:18.660]   God gave us the language of Christian hedonism and we don't need to be ashamed of repeating
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.220]   his old happy language.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:30.500]   The last thing I would say is that you read widely concerning the things you care about.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.820]   It is good to find a teacher who shows you things you've never seen.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:42.820]   It is also good to listen to a half a dozen other teachers who can help you see the same
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:50.900]   thing from different angles or other things that put the thing you love in an even brighter
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.900]   perspective.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:04.140]   And I'll just end by saying that in the mid to late 70s, 1970s, anybody who listened to
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:19.020]   or looked at the 20-something John Piper and also knew his teacher Dan Fuller, they laughed.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.340]   They laughed because my mannerisms, my tones of voice, my peculiar expressions, they all
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.380]   echoed my most influential teacher.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.740]   I didn't begrudge that, frankly, I considered it a badge.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.220]   I liked it.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:48.180]   I was very happy to be the inadvertent imitator of the man who showed me so much glory, but
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:55.340]   I grew out of that and there came a day when nobody saw me as an imitator anymore.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.340]   That's really helpful.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.780]   This episode reminds me of John Piper's newest trilogy of books, too.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.740]   I should mention those here as we close this episode.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.180]   Those three books include A Peculiar Glory, Reading the Bible Supernaturally, and Expository
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.180]   Exaltation.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.580]   We did an overview of those three books in APJ 1047 if you want more information, but
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.220]   those three books are critical if you want to develop as a Bible student and as an effective
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.420]   communicator on your own.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.420]   Check those out.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.780]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.140]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.020]   We are going to look at God's abounding love to his children, to us, when we gather next
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.020]   time on Wednesday.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.940]   Paul calls it God's great love.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.300]   That's so good.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.420]   I'm your host Tony Renke, and we're going to look at that great love more closely on
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.660]   Wednesday when we return.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   Thanks for listening.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.020]   We'll see you then.
