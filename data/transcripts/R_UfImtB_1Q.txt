[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.260]   - A friend of ours, Greg Lucas, is a police officer
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.440]   and he writes in to ask this,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.200]   "Pastor John, what can a white Christian police officer
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.460]   "who loves Jesus and his fellow man do
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.680]   "to make a God-honoring difference
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.480]   "in the race issues facing our country?"
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380]   - Well, I'd say to Greg,
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.320]   why am I teaching you anything about this?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'm the one who ought to be sitting
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.000]   at your feet at this point.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.480]   In fact, I really do believe we need to sit
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.900]   at the feet of godly policemen right now
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.940]   and have them talk to us because we may,
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.420]   John Piper may be a bit naive in things that I write
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.720]   and say about my reaction to police,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200]   but he beat me to the question,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.780]   so perhaps I have to say something.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.600]   My respect for Greg Lucas is enormous.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   Especially because of his care for kids with disabilities
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   and his own faithfulness as a dad
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.080]   in his book, "Wrestling With an Angel."
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   Greg is a thoughtful, caring,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.040]   fair-minded dad and police officer,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000]   and of course there are thousands like him
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.480]   and he's a Christian,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.360]   and so the way he posed the question comes out of that.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.440]   Can a white officer who loves Jesus
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.040]   and his fellow man make a god-honoring difference
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.880]   in the race issues?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.080]   And the answer is he can,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.960]   and maybe even though I'm saying this with great hesitancy
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.280]   because I've never been a policeman,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880]   I've never stared down anybody with a knife or a gun
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080]   or anything that would make my heart beat so hard,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.480]   I'd probably just collapse in a moment.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm gonna say some things and then expect the officers
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   who listen to take them and do whatever tweaking
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040]   and adjusting is necessary to give them a flavor of reality
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.560]   that I've never walked through.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440]   So here's my first suggestion.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   Greg and all the other officers
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.360]   develop a God-given thick skin.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.320]   Everybody who leads,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.280]   and all police officers lead and pastors lead,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920]   and goodness, everybody leads in some way,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.600]   but everybody who leads, especially publicly,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.720]   will be criticized, often unjustly.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.000]   There are bad apples in every barrel,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.720]   white barrels and black barrels,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.840]   and community barrels and police barrels.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.800]   There are bad apples in every barrel,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.200]   and some people criticize the whole barrel,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   and the good apples can really get easily angered and hurt
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.440]   so that even the good apples then
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.400]   can start to be part of the problem,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.080]   and that could be prevented
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   if there was a God-given thick skin
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.280]   able to hear angry words
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120]   and not be wounded or made vengeful by them.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   Or here's another way to say it,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.560]   maybe more positively, would be that
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.520]   we need to cultivate,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.640]   whether it's police officers or anybody,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.520]   seeds of patience.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.480]   I think Christian police officers will help others see
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.960]   that there are historic reasons
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440]   for outcries against the police,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   and that there are some situations,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.200]   some situations where there's warrant for the outcry,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.720]   but that does not mean that all officers are being indicted,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   though it may feel that way in the moment,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.600]   and I think it's just a great mark of maturity and patience
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.040]   to be able to hear criticism,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.880]   and only own what is yours,
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.600]   and not what is not yours to own.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   I would say to Greg,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   speak to the issue of racial harmony in the department,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.520]   the police force,
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.720]   when it's not a red-hot public issue.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.920]   In other words, when the issue goes away
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   from the front pages,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.160]   and it will go away from the front pages,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.640]   that's the golden moment, I think,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   to talk the issue of racial harmony,
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.480]   and racial reconciliation,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.000]   and diversity, and justice,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   and you wanna sow seeds of ethnic harmony
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.160]   rooted in the Christian vision of man,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.720]   created in the image of God,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.280]   and man reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.480]   And then I would say,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   cultivate freedom from personal revenge
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.680]   as a motive in the use of power.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.880]   And here's what I have in mind.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   Just yesterday, I read an article in the New York Times
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.080]   about a Navy pilot.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   He happened to be a classmate of mine.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.680]   I didn't even know about this, from Wheaton.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.480]   flew 500 combat missions.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.520]   And what gave it such a personal twist
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.880]   is that his dad was a missionary in North Vietnam
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.680]   and had been killed by the Vietnamese,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   and how easy it would have been for this Navy pilot
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.320]   flying 500 combat missions
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   to have his teeth grinding every time with revenge.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.000]   And here's what he said in the article.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.400]   "I was taught that vengeance was the Lord's,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.160]   and you defer to that."
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.520]   So this is being reported in a major newspaper.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.280]   He said, "After a strike,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.720]   I was pleased that I could say, 'Mission accomplished,'
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   but I never felt, 'Ah, I got somebody back.'
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.040]   In fact, if I had a junior officer
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.000]   that I knew was out for revenge,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.520]   I would probably keep him out of the air."
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.040]   Now, I suspect that's probably good advice
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.200]   for police officers as well,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.440]   which simply means I think Christians want to sow the seeds
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.760]   that there's justice to be done here,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.560]   but it's not an occasional for personal revenge,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.760]   and where personal vengeance
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.400]   is starting to take the upper place,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.960]   the officers are gonna probably not do their job as well.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   And then I'd say, "Spot and expose policies,
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.640]   regulations, rules, procedures, traditions
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   in the department that might be expressing
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.880]   or shaping racist attitudes."
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.960]   In other words, give attention
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.280]   to this whole issue of structural stuff
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.320]   and not just individual stuff.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.280]   Just a couple more things.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.840]   When I tweeted back in November,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   right after the Michael Brown case had come down
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   with the non-indictment of Officer Wilson,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.280]   I tweeted this,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.120]   "An indictment of Wilson may not have been the way,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.520]   but what's needed from police now
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   is good evidence of firm resolve of equal treatment."
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.960]   Now, I got a lot of upswell of like what's,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.440]   and so my next tweet,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.200]   I think it was just an hour later maybe,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.560]   was, for example,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.360]   "Empathetic public resolves from the police."
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.520]   Two, "Redoubled effort
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.920]   to hire and train minority officers."
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.080]   Three, "Increased research and development
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.440]   on how to disarm without killing."
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   And I think all three of those are important and serious.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.360]   And the last thing I would say is,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.240]   I just was reading a few weeks ago,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.320]   and I put this in the blog I wrote recently
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.440]   after our experience down in Nashville,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.520]   I mean Memphis,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.560]   Richmond, California,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.760]   a city with a high crime rate,
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.880]   has not seen any deaths
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.720]   from policemen on community since 2007.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.480]   And the reasons were given like this,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   and I'll just tick 'em off.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.840]   "One, an emphasis on alternatives to bullets
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.320]   like tasers and pepper spray.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.240]   Two, an ethos of accountability,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.200]   every bullet has your name on it.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.760]   Three, monthly firearm training,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.000]   quarterly role-playing in hard situations.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.560]   Four, a strong force with manpower
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.440]   and money to deploy and train wisely.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.080]   Five, a change in culture from the top down.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.840]   Six, strong efforts in neighborhood relations.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.400]   And seven, all of this flowing
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.840]   from a new culture-changing leader."
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.960]   So those are just random ideas and thoughts
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.200]   about how Christian police officers might move
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.040]   towards creating change for good
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.460]   in racial harmony and just treatment.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.600]   But again, I just wanna say how thankful,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   how thankful I am in my neighborhood for policemen
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.040]   and how much I tremble for what they face
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.920]   over and over again,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.280]   and how much I don't want to second-guess them,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.640]   and how much I respect them,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.920]   because biblically I'm supposed to pray for them.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.320]   They are the instruments in God's hands
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.200]   for my protection and for the doing of justice.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.600]   And so if they hear anything in this that sounds naive
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.920]   or like it's really out of touch with reality,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.560]   well, it probably is, and forgive me,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   but if anything could be helpful,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.600]   I offer it.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.040]   Wonderful, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.000]   And thank you for the question, Greg.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.620]   This reminds me of an episode we released a while back
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.400]   titled "Should Christians Be Cops and Soldiers?"
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.080]   That was episode number 318,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.180]   and you can find it in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.660]   in our free apps, or on our website, DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.120]   We're gonna break for the weekend now,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.960]   but we return with John Piper on Monday.
