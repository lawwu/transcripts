[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.720]   Well, you know, listeners to this podcast will know that John Piper preached
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.540]   through the entire book of Romans in 225 sermons.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.580]   Incredible.
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.460]   The series took him eight years and eight months to complete, spanning from
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.800]   the spring of 1998 to the end of 2006.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560]   All 225 of those rich messages are collected together and can be found
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.320]   online under the series title, The Greatest Letter Ever Written.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.920]   That's what you want to look for, The Greatest Letter Ever Written.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   The series is also the most epic John Piper sermon series ever recorded.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.200]   And I know many of you have listened to it all, and as you do, you'll come across
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.560]   a bunch of little nuggets along the way, like this clip I want to play for you
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.440]   today, sent in by a listener to the podcast.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.400]   In the following sermon, Pastor John gets into the topic of how do we ensure that
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.920]   our daily Bible reading discipline is authentic and not rote. The topic
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.080]   arose in the series in a sermon titled, Let Love Be Genuine on Romans 12, verse
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   9, preached on November 21st, 2004.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.600]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.360]   Let's begin with some thoughts here now from Romans about how to read a text
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.080]   like this in a way that changes us deeply.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.040]   There are 13 exhortations in just verses 9 to 13.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080]   So.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.320]   Suppose you get up in the morning and you set yourself like a good Christian to
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.000]   read your Bible before you head off to work, that's a good idea, you should do
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.640]   that. So you set yourself maybe to read a few chapters or let's say Romans 12 is
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.200]   included, may take you three minutes to read through Romans 12, which means that
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.280]   you give maybe 15 seconds to these 13 commandments, 13 exhortations.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920]   Let love be genuine.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.960]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.640]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.480]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.960]   Don't be slothful in zeal.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   Be fervent in the spirit.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.360]   Serve the Lord.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400]   Rejoice in hope.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.960]   Be patient in tribulation.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.400]   Be constant in prayer.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.320]   Contribute to the needs of the saints.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.400]   Seek to show hospitality.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.480]   13 in five verses.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.880]   You've read them, 15 seconds on them.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.920]   Close your Bible, pray, off to work.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.760]   How many of them can you even remember?
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   I mean, are you now fired up and totally engaged and renewed in all 13 new areas of
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.920]   your life?
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.040]   Is that the effect of reading the Bible in the morning?
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.200]   It doesn't work like that, does it?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.400]   So what are we supposed to do?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   Because Paul didn't write that just to tickle our ears.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.120]   He he didn't just write those things for nothing to happen.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   He really means all 13 of those exhortations to become reality.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.040]   And as we read them to become more and more reality, and as we preach on them to become
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760]   more and more reality, they aren't just there.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.600]   So we need help for what to do with the Bible so that the Bible becomes powerful,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680]   changes us, right?
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   This isn't written for nothing.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.120]   So to get help, turn with me to chapter 15.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.560]   I asked the apostle Paul, Paul, you got any help for us here on how to read chapter 12?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.120]   And Paul said, yes, it's here in verses 15 and 16 of chapter 15.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   On some points, I have written to you very boldly by way of reminders.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.040]   Stop there.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.120]   Just realize that the Bible for veteran Christians is mainly repeat.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.760]   I will never read a new thing in the Bible.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.200]   I've read the Bible dozens and dozens of times, every word of it over and over again.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.960]   I'll never see a new word in the Bible.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.200]   I pray that I will see new reality, new truth, new power, new implications.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.400]   But the words I've seen them all over and over again.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:23.720]   Reminder, don't ever begrudge a small group, a family devotion, a Bible reading,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.280]   a sermon that is sheer reminder of what you already know, because God has things in those
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.160]   old familiar truths that you never saw yet.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.000]   Things to change in you haven't been changed yet.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.480]   So just be aware the Bible is mainly reminder for old Christians, and that's crucial for
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.560]   living the Christian life.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.960]   So Paul says, I've written to you very boldly by way of reminder because of the grace
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.720]   given to me.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   So know that the Bible is a gracious gift.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.840]   Paul was graced to write it for us.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   Don't neglect it.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.680]   Verse 16, "To be a minister," I have this grace to be a minister of Christ Jesus to
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.240]   the Gentiles, that's us mainly, "in the priestly service of the gospel so that,"
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.360]   and here comes the reason for writing this down and doing this ministry, why do we read
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.400]   Romans 12?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.080]   "So that the offering of the Gentiles," so we're now treated like a worship offering,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.280]   I should remind you of chapter 12, verse 1, "Present your bodies to living sacrifices,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.120]   which is your spiritual service of worship."
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.360]   We are being offered up by the apostle Paul as worship to God, as we're transformed
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.720]   into the image of his son, God's son, "So that the offering of the Gentiles may be
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   acceptable."
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:01.480]   So Paul has written Romans so that you and I would become more acceptable.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   Is that word acceptable, Renie Bells, from chapter 12?
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.160]   Verse 2, "Be transformed so that you may prove what is acceptable,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.440]   embrace the will of God, acceptable."
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.720]   And when you do that, this is happening, the offering of the Gentiles,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.960]   verse 1, offering worship, verse 2, "Transform to prove what is acceptable."
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.360]   This is happening by the writing of Romans.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.640]   So when you read it, this should be happening, and then comes the
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:39.960]   all-decisive phrase, "Sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:47.760]   You know and I know reading the Bible has zero effect on our lives apart from the
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.480]   Holy Spirit.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   If, in fact, we try to do the Bible without the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.360]   we become colossal legalists, counting our own moral resolve.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   "I can do this.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.120]   Watch me."
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.160]   Instead, what we need is the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   So now, I have drawn out of these verses three things that help me read Romans 12
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240]   life-changingly.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.120]   I want to be changed by these messages.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.560]   I want to be changed by verse 9, "Let love be without hypocrisy."
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.080]   I want to be less hypocritical after I read that phrase.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.400]   How can I do that?
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.520]   What will make the difference for a word, a little phrase,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.880]   to suddenly have life-changing, powerful power to make me less hypocritical,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.800]   more free and authentic and genuine and real in my love?
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.360]   Here are my three guidelines for how to read that.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.480]   One, pray as you read because if the Holy Spirit is the one who takes the Bible and
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480]   applies it to us so that it really produces an alteration in our whole
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.840]   demeanor and our way of seeing God and our way of treating each other,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.200]   then we should ask Him.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.680]   So when you read, you pause, you say, "Oh, Holy Spirit,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.440]   come make this real in my life.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.080]   Do whatever you have to do to make me humble, to make me authentic,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.240]   to make me loving."
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.480]   That's the way you pray.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.840]   It's real risky.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.480]   Last night, just before we walked into the service, a band of us,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.280]   several of us just gathered around in the choir room downstairs downtown where I
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.080]   preached this last night, and we said, and there were "mm-hmms"
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.960]   and "amens" all around as I said, "Lord, whatever it takes, death,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:02.160]   loss of job, cancer, whatever it takes, take away my hypocrisy.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.840]   Whatever it takes in this church, whatever it takes, do it because we want
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.720]   to be real.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.840]   We want to be Christian.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.720]   We want these words in Romans 12 to become reality.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.200]   We don't just want to speak words and have love be in word only and not in deed
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   and not in heart.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.600]   So pray.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.520]   That's number one.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.040]   Pray as you read the Bible, "Do this in my life."
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.560]   Number two, look away to Jesus as you read the Bible.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.480]   As you read Romans 12 and you hear, "Let love be without dissimulation,"
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.640]   that's the old King James word, or "Let love be without hypocrisy,"
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.040]   that's a good literal translation, "Let love be genuine," ESV.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.680]   When you read that, say to yourself, "No way I'm going to pull that off.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.640]   I'm a born hypocrite.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.160]   I love the praise of other people.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.080]   I know I'm not perfect.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.600]   I'm always putting up fronts.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.240]   I want to be a loving person, authentic.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.000]   I don't want to play at love.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.360]   Therefore, I look away from myself.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.080]   I look away to Jesus.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.240]   He was born and died to forgive all my hypocrisy.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.600]   He modeled for me the perfectly transparent life.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   He has now taught me and given me a goal to aim at, and He is my satisfaction,
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.720]   my forgiver, my model, my treasure."
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.920]   When you look away to Jesus, that satisfaction that comes from Him is the
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.280]   ground and root by which you become free from hypocrisy.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.080]   So that's number two, look away in faith to Jesus, not to yourself.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.680]   Number three, slow down and meditate on these words.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.880]   I know this is tough because on the one hand, you hear a message coming
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.640]   from this pulpit, "Read the Bible.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   Read the whole Bible.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.560]   Get your Discipleship Journal reading plan and read the Bible all the way
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.720]   through in one year."
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.040]   Well, you're on a lickety-split pace to get through the Bible, and here I am
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   telling you now, slow down and meditate on the first half of verse 9 of chapter 12.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.640]   Now, what in the world are you supposed to do?
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.880]   Read through the Bible or meditate on verse 9?
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.720]   What do you want me to do?
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.840]   And the answer is both, and I don't know how.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   I just know I've got to read the Bible fast, I've got to read the Bible slow.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.560]   Because if you don't read the Bible fast to get through it in a year or two,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.640]   you can't get the big picture, you can't get the whole terrain.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.440]   And yet, if you don't slow down, here's the analogy.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.080]   This analogy has been with me ever since the first jumbo jet was made.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.720]   You can remember that.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.280]   Most of that's in your lifetime, right?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.040]   The first jumbo jet with a big hump on the front, how can they do that?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.760]   A two-decker plane, unbelievable.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.480]   I remember that.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.240]   So I picture this thing flies about 560 miles an hour, and it flies really high,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.360]   you know, 37,000, 38,000 feet.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.320]   And I pictured it flying over Florida and all these orange groves.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.880]   And you look down and you could just, you could almost see the whole Florida,
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.440]   and there's an orange grove.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.880]   And you say, "Wow, that's an amazing orange grove.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.040]   Very nourishing.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.400]   Really tastes good.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.320]   Really gives me energy."
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.480]   Wrong, it doesn't.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.000]   You just...
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.560]   And that's the way we read the Bibles.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.360]   But it's good to see Florida.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.720]   It really is.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.000]   It's valuable to see Florida in the Bible.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.640]   But if you never land that thing in Orlando, and don't go to Disney World,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.000]   go to the orange grove and just start walking through the orange grove.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.160]   Here's verse 9, first half of the verse, and you pause under the tree and you
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.920]   pick that one, and you look at it, that's a beautiful thing.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.880]   "Let love be genuine."
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.640]   I wonder what that means.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.200]   Would I love to be like that?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.320]   I want to be like that.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:11.800]   Holy Spirit, please, kill the disease of hypocrisy in my life.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.600]   You got to slow down.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   You got to meditate.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.000]   You got to ask, "What does it mean?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.440]   How does it relate to my life?
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.920]   How does it relate to the other parts of Scripture?"
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.600]   And all the while praying, "Oh, make a difference.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.480]   Make a difference in my life."
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.760]   So, those are my three guidelines, which I think are implied in chapter 15,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.840]   verses 15 and 16.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.440]   Word and spirit.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.880]   Word, verse 15, spirit, verse 16 of chapter 15.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.680]   We read the Bible, we pray for the spirit, we savor it, we linger over it,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.080]   we look away to Jesus.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.760]   The reason looking away to Jesus is so crucial is because the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:58.680]   according to John 16, 14, is given to glorify Christ.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.760]   So, if you read the Bible with view to doing it in your own strength,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.280]   the Holy Spirit will keep His distance from you.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.000]   If you read the Bible looking away to Jesus and saying, "Jesus,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.960]   I want you to be magnified.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.080]   I want you to be displayed in the kind of loving person I become," the Holy Spirit
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.520]   kicks in with power because He's there to magnify Jesus.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.280]   - So powerful.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.840]   That line stands out, "Lord, whatever it takes, death, the loss of a job,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.680]   cancer, whatever it takes, Lord, take away my hypocrisy."
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   Wow.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.560]   What a bold prayer.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   This clip was taken from one of the 225 Roman sermons of Pastor John in a
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.800]   sermon titled, "Let Love Be Genuine," preached on November 21st, 2004.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.400]   It came in from a podcast listener named Daniel.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.840]   Now, as you listen to Piper's sermon, send us the clips you find.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.040]   If you've got a good one, email me.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.400]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.640]   happens in the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.400]   By the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.080]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.880]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.280]   God is always enough for us because He is always self-sufficient.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.360]   It's a wonderful and worshipful theme that we are going to press into as we
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.520]   close the week out.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.600]   Don't miss it.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.160]   We can't hear this enough, God's self-sufficiency and what that means
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.680]   for our happiness in Him.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.280]   That's up next time.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.040]   I'm your host, Tommy Ranke.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.920]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that on Friday.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.560]   We'll see you then.
