[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   One time we talked about, I want to bring this up, Greg Oden, because I've seen a video
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.520]   on Instagram and it was just a video of him, I don't know if you've seen it, him walking
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.200]   around and an old lady just asking him, "Did you used to play basketball?"
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.120]   It was like, he said, "I used to," and he was just like, you could just see how sad
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   he was.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.880]   But me and you have talked about Greg Oden and how good and dominant he actually was.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.240]   Even in the practices with you, he was obviously one of the best players, so talk about that
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   dude for a little bit.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.280]   Yeah, man, Greg, I'm glad you even asked me about him.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.880]   Like you said, I always speak about him, but never with much of an audience.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.840]   So that's cool of you to even think about him, but you were a reason why I did think
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.040]   of him, because when I got to the Blazers, Greg came in a year after I did, and man,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.280]   I remember I had just won Rookie of the Year, and I think it was Kevin Pitcher was like,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.480]   "Man, you want to do the draft lottery?"
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.560]   And I was like, "No," because he knows I don't like to fly and travel, especially
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560]   my off-season.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   He's like, "Nah, I ain't asking this time.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   You got to do it.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.160]   Come on, B. You got to do our good luck charm."
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.440]   I'm like, "Man, all right, but I'm going to fly there, and I'm going to fly right
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.440]   back."
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.440]   He's like, "All right, done."
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   So I ended up going out there.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   And we knew who it was.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.540]   It was like, if you're number one or two, you're going to take Durant or Oden.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.360]   But we were going to be like seven, so I was thinking like, "All right, whatever."
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.720]   Man, I get there, and we ended up getting the number one pick.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.040]   And I was like, "Oh, man, I am the good luck charm."
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.040]   So I joke around.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680]   And to this day, I still got the jersey that they gave that day where Blazers number one
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   pick.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.520]   I don't know if they know that, but I kept that.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.080]   I was going through some stuff the other day, and I had seen it.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.560]   But we get the number one pick, and people are asking all these questions.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.160]   Before I went on, our media person was like, "Don't tell anybody who we're picking
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   or who we're leaning."
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.320]   So I give the whole, what do you call it, public answer or whatever they call it.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.220]   So I ended up getting back to Portland, and I'm thinking like, "Who are we going to
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.220]   take?"
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.220]   Because now everybody's texting.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.220]   It ain't social media.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.840]   Everybody's like, "Well, who are you guys going to take, Kevin Durant or Greg Oden?"
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.640]   And everything that I'm going to say about Greg Oden is not taking anything away from
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   Kevin Durant.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.440]   Kevin Durant is, again, he's on that level of guys where my favorites are Jordan, Kobe,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.680]   Kevin Durant.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.040]   He's in that conversation.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   But Greg Oden, man, when I seen him, and you got to remember, this is a different NBA now.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   You still post up.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   You still play with the big.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.360]   So long story short, we end up drafting Greg, and we're having these workouts, and we're
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.720]   doing football stuff, and we're out on the field.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Man, we was doing 100 yard down and backs, and Greg and Marcus are like, "They're winning,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.040]   and these dudes are the tallest players on the team.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   He could run.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   He could run."
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.920]   And then, when we got in the open gym, whoever's team Greg was on was going to win, because
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   you know how it is.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.440]   Man, we're all good, but it comes down to those couple plays here and there, and Greg
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.600]   can defend better than just about anybody, and then he can get offensive rebounds.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.080]   He kept every ball alive.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.720]   So I was like, "Man," and I remember I called my dad, and he was like, "How good is he?"
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   I was like, "We could win a championship."
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.320]   For the first time in my life, playing with him, I was like, "We could win a championship.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.600]   He was that good."
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.920]   And I'm not saying we could win that year, but having him on the team, we had everything
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.500]   we needed to win a championship, because he filled a lot of those holes.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.120]   And I was like, "Man, he was that good."
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.080]   Once he got comfortable in games, I was telling Nate, I'm like, "I don't know.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.620]   I'm kind of bored, because Greg does so much."
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.120]   Even defensively, I'm guarding dudes, and our help defense don't have to really help,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   because he helps everything.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   So I started learning.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   I'm like, "Okay, so I'm going to leak out."
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.680]   I started getting more transition stuff, because I'm like, "Greg's going to get the board."
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.320]   And offensively, he gets tips.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   He just tips.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.600]   He's pushing dudes, just tipping the ball, keeping plays alive.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.440]   We've got second chance points, and I was like, "Man, he made the game so damn easy."
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.840]   And Lamarcus had to figure out how to play with them, because even when he gets post-touches,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.360]   man, they're doubling, so we're more open, and we're not used to being open.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.920]   We're used to having to carry the load to win games, and now we're winning games more
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920]   comfortably.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.840]   So, no, he was a special player, and I hate when people try to say stuff's a bust.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.360]   He was injured, but if he was never injured, there's no way in hell he was a bust.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.280]   He had a hall of fame talent.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   That kid was good.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.040]   He could shoot free throws with his left hand.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.600]   He shoot 'em with his right.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.300]   He had everything, and I just wish the world would have got a chance to see that.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   He was that good.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   He was that good.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   He was an even better person, man.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   He'd have loved to be his teammate.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.300]   Cool as a fan, man.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300]   Best dude.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300]   I'm telling you, man.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   We were in Vegas.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.800]   I went to Summer League, and like I said, I had just won Rick of the Year.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.760]   I played really well, and man, we were all down there playing the little dollar slots
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   clowning around.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.120]   People were coming up to us, and Greg came down to the lobby, man, it was mayhem.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.720]   I was like, "We got to leave."
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.120]   Security was like, "We're just going to take you guys back to your rooms," because people
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   just went that crazy.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.560]   I was like, "Damn, he's that big."
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.640]   It was real special to see Greg again.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.800]   Kevin Durant has blossomed to ... He's one of the best players to ever play the game,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.680]   and Greg Odom was right there with him.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   Again, like I said, even then, it was no who's better, it was just they're both going to
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.520]   be great players.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's just a matter of who you're going to take, and that's what made it like, man, I
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.120]   just hate that the world couldn't see him at that Kevin Durant level, because they would
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.480]   probably still be rivaling each other, you know what I mean, going at it, because he
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.140]   could protect that basket, Kevin Durant could stretch the court, so I thought they had that
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.580]   kind of that kind of bot.
