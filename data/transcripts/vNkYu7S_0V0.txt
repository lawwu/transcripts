[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Scripture is the sum and substance of biblical counseling.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.200]   There is no biblical counseling without scripture.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.040]   If you take the Bible out of biblical counseling, it's just man's counseling.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.440]   It's man's wisdom, which is not nearly sufficient to help man deal with the
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.720]   spiritual problems that he encounters in this life.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.020]   It's not sufficient to save and it's not sufficient to sanctify, but the Bible, as
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.240]   we know, is. And the more accurate the translation of the Bible that we have,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.920]   the better we are able to understand and apply it to our lives as believers and
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800]   grow in Christlikeness.
