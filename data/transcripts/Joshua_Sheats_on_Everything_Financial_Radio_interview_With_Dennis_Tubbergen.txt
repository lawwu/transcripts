[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   This is the Everything Financial Radio Podcast.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.540]   I am your host, Dennis Tubergen.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560]   Glad you're listening in this week.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.760]   And if you're a regular listener,
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.980]   thank you and welcome back.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.920]   If you're a new listener,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.480]   this is where we talk about what's going on in the economy,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.880]   what's going on politically,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.300]   and what it might mean for you and your money.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.160]   Each week, I interview typically a couple of guest experts
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.440]   and share their perspectives with you.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.120]   This past week, I caught up with Mr. Gerald Salente.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.000]   Gerald is the publisher of Trends Journal.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   Certainly always enjoy my conversation
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.000]   with Gerald and his perspective.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560]   I also caught up with the host
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440]   of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast this past week,
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.480]   Mr. Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.600]   That conversation I will be sharing with you as well
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.840]   on this week's podcast.

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.960]   Joining me once again
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900]   on the Everything Financial radio program
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.400]   is the founder and director of the Trends Research Institute
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.320]   and the publisher of Trends Journal, Mr. Gerald Salente.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.380]   Gerald has been one of my favorite guests over the years.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.160]   And Gerald, thank you for taking time out
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.520]   to join us again today.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.880]   - Oh, always great being out with you.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.680]   Thanks for asking that.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.700]   - Gerald, let's talk about the economy.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960]   The talking heads, the mainstream media say
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840]   we have a recovery going,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   although the recovery is a bit anemic.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.600]   But when you look at the jobs numbers
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.320]   and you look at some of the underlying data,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960]   it just seems that that doesn't add up.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.340]   What's your take?
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.960]   - Well, you know, first of all,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.240]   the world is bigger than the United States.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.560]   And although it's the largest economy in the world,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.200]   there's a lot more going on out there.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.680]   So let's take a trip to China.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.020]   And remember, China's growth
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.040]   and all of the stimulus that they pumped into the place
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.880]   following the panic of '08
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.680]   is one of the reasons why you saw commodity prices go so high
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   and also a recovery from that terrible hit
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.560]   that happened back then.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720]   So take a look at what's going on in China.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   They just came out with their import-export numbers.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.400]   They're dismal.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.160]   They're negative, both of them.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.580]   And you take a trip to Japan,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.920]   despite two rounds of Abe-nomics,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.600]   trillions of yen pumped into the market,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.800]   they fluctuate between recession and stagnation.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   Matter of fact, since Abe's been in government
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   since 2012, the entire GDP of Japan's
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.200]   only grown about 2.4%.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.960]   You have a global slowdown.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.840]   Look what's going on in Europe.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.400]   Look at the banking problems they have.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.820]   Look at the real numbers coming out,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.400]   the declines in bank shares,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.880]   whether it's Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.600]   Paribus, one after another.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.160]   So there's no recovery.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.480]   It's a global recession.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   It's bigger than America.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   Take a trip to Brazil.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.220]   Wanna have some fun?
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.620]   Go to Venezuela.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.000]   You look around, whether it's Nigeria, Angola, Congo,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.920]   when these commodity prices collapsed,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   so too did a lot of the world economies.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.360]   So there's no recovery.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.960]   And when you look at the jobs numbers
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.120]   in the United States that they're touting, it's a sham.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.280]   For example, we've lost five million jobs
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   in manufacturing in the USSA since about 2000.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.800]   The five million jobs that are replaced
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   are in the hospitality sector.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.480]   Isn't that a nice proper word?
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320]   Hospitality sector.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.520]   Bartenders, waitresses, waiters, making beds in hotels.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.640]   Not that those are demeaning jobs.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.520]   I don't mean that in any way.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.580]   What I mean to say is that the fact is
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.080]   they don't pay a lot of money.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.680]   Healthcare, health aides, ambulatory services.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.880]   So when you look at real wages
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.240]   and median household income in the United States,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.980]   median household income is below 1999 levels.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.040]   95% of the wealth created since the stock market boom
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.500]   that began with all of the quantitative easing
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.480]   and all of the zero interest rate policy,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.160]   and this effect has gone to the 1%.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.600]   95% of the wealth created in the US has gone to the 1%.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.840]   Worldwide, 62 people have more money
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   than half the world's population combined.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   Recovery, how about calling it a coverup?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.560]   - You know, we're chatting today with Gerald Salente,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.920]   founder and director of the Trends Research Institute,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.400]   also publisher of the Trends Journal.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.160]   I would encourage you to check out his work
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.480]   at trendsresearch.com.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.440]   And Gerald, as you were talking about this wealth gap,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.160]   although you didn't really use that term,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.200]   it just strikes me that with all the quantitative
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   easing programs we've seen really worldwide,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.720]   it really seems to have proven that if you're close
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.000]   to the printing press, you benefit.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.080]   And the further you are away,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.800]   these policies actually harm Main Street America.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.760]   Would you agree?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.560]   - Well, they do, because look at the facts again.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.220]   Negative interest rates, zero interest rate policy,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.340]   who does it help?
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.640]   The facts are there.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.600]   You're looking at stock buybacks in the first three months
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   of the year, it's about $160 billion in the United States.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.920]   So they're borrowing the money for nothing,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.680]   going back, buying back their own stock
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.560]   and driving up the equity prices.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.200]   Mergers and acquisition activity,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.680]   borrowing the dough for nothing,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.640]   and they're buying up other companies.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.080]   And it's a war against the savers,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.560]   because we have no place to put our money.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.040]   You don't put in the bank anymore and get,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.940]   you don't even get a toaster anymore.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.000]   (laughing)
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.680]   You put it in the bank, you get nothing back for it.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.400]   People used to retire on their savings.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.960]   So that's gone.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.520]   And again, all it's done is benefited the,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.720]   you know, the equity markets, the gamblers.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.520]   By the way, you look at what's going on
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.440]   with what happened with the Brexit vote in the UK.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   What was it about?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.760]   Read the facts.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.960]   They're there for everybody that wants to open their eyes
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   and look at them.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.080]   One of the major issues is anti-globalization
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   and a reaction against the elites
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.640]   running and owning everything
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.140]   and the rest of the people working in slavelandia.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.200]   - So, Joe, when you look at the Brexit vote,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.240]   I mean, I look at that and it's a move
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.600]   towards protectionism and nationalism.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.120]   And we saw the same thing when the world economy slowed
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.700]   in the early '30s.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.100]   In your view as a trends forecaster,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.680]   is the Brexit vote the first of many such votes
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.800]   around the world?
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   It's a matter of fact,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.000]   we're coming out with a new trends journal shortly.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.200]   And what we're writing about is people power.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.480]   And that's what this really, you know, like it or not,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.600]   you know, that's what it was.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.640]   And it's a reaction against, again, the mobs,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.240]   the people like to call them in the States,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   the Republicans and the Democrats, for example.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.200]   How about the bloods in the crypts?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.960]   You know, I don't say that sarcastically.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.720]   How many more people do the Republicans and Democrats
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   have to murder around the world
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   in the name of freedom and democracy
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   before anybody calls a murderer a murderer?
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.760]   How many more drone strikes?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.060]   What is 4,000 innocent people killed
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.800]   by that Nobel Peace Prize winner Obama
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.880]   on his terror Tuesdays when he's quoted as saying,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.720]   I'll quote, "I'm really good at killing people."
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.600]   In the book "Double Down."
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.640]   Thieves, they rob our money in the name of too big to fail,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   loan guarantees, and bailouts to their friends.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.320]   I mean, let's call it what it is.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.700]   And when you see the Brexit vote is a reaction against that.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.440]   It's going on globally
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.280]   in all the Western so-called democracies.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   These are not democracies.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.200]   These are neo-feudal societies.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.240]   We've taken away from the kings, the queens, and nobility,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.840]   and we gave it to a small club.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   The Oxford, the Eaton boys,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.760]   the Harvard, Princeton, Yale gang,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.320]   the White Shoe Boys on Wall Street of the city of London.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.040]   When are people gonna grow up and call it what it is?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.800]   And that's what the reaction is.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.960]   The anger out there is real.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.480]   The people are being shafted.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.800]   They feel it in their lives, in their pocketbooks.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.240]   Look what's going on in the United States.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.880]   Do you know that the millennial age people,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.320]   their amount of home buying is at a record low?
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.800]   They're left getting out of college
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   with $100,000 worth of debt
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.120]   and getting jobs as baristas at Starbucks.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.160]   Yeah, I used to be a soda jerk when I was a kid.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.920]   You know, they're now adults,
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.040]   soda jerks pouring out coffee
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.080]   as what is, with Starbucks owns, what, nearly 8,000 outlets.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.380]   And that puts out a business
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.160]   of all the people that used to want to compete,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.080]   whether it's in that or fast food or multinationals.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.120]   That's what the Brexit vote is about.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.920]   It's a reaction against a few owning everything.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's a reaction against the 62 people, according to Oxfam,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.160]   that owned more dough
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.020]   than half the world's population combined.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.360]   - Well, we are chatting today with the founder
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.400]   and director of the Trends Research Institute,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.360]   publisher of Trends Journal, Mr. Gerald Celente.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.280]   I would encourage you to check out his work
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.040]   at trendsresearch.com.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.320]   It's one of my favorite publications to read.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.480]   Again, I'd encourage you to check it out.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.960]   We'll be back and continue our conversation with Gerald
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.080]   when Everything Financial Radio returns.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.920]   Stay with us.

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.540]   - Well, I certainly hope you're enjoying the conversation
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.920]   that I had with Mr. Gerald Celente this past week.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.080]   I'll get right back to that conversation now.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.280]   I'm joined on the Everything Financial Radio program
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.920]   today by the founder and director
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.620]   of the Trends Research Institute
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.440]   and publisher of the Trends Journal, Mr. Gerald Celente.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.480]   The website to check out his work is trendsresearch.com.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.760]   And Gerald, in the last segment,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.080]   we were talking a bit about,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.660]   or alluded anyway to,
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.760]   you'd mentioned the too big to fail banks.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.020]   And to talk about banking again,
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.720]   I mean, it seems that these too big to fail banks
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.920]   are essentially in worse condition
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.200]   than they were prior to the bailout.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.880]   The derivative exposure is greater.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.480]   The return of the no money down mortgage is back.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.240]   And are we just ready to see a repeat performance
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.280]   of what we saw back in 2007 and 2008 in your view?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.840]   - I think it's going to be much worse
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.680]   because the bubble that is built up by this equity boom
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.000]   that's not based on price earning ratios,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.860]   it's based on speculation.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.400]   It's based, again, on stock buybacks
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.680]   and merger and acquisition activity.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.160]   And stock buyback levels are returning to records.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.280]   So there's no real price discovery.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   It's been inflated with zero interest rate,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.620]   negative interest rate policy.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.720]   I mean, you know, Dennis, you're a nice guy.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.200]   You know, I've been on your show a number of times.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.480]   I got a deal for you.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.280]   I have some bonds to sell.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.440]   We're going to call them negative yields.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   That's right.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.600]   In 20 years, when you cash in this, or 10 years,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.780]   you're going to get less back
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.340]   than what you bought the bond for
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.900]   because I like you so much.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.920]   You can't make this stuff up.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.560]   This has never been done in the history of the world.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.040]   So what they've done is they've created
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.320]   an artificial bubble that's bigger
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.200]   than anything we've ever seen.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.040]   Look what's going on.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   Look why the market's going up.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.460]   I want the good news, for example,
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.840]   that over in Japan, you know, Abe's party over there,
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   Shinzo Abe, they won an election last week,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.120]   and now they could do more.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.560]   Abe-nomics.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.840]   Well, round one and two failed, miserably.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.380]   So now they're going to go for round three.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.620]   Oh, and by the way, what is their debt to GDP ratio?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.100]   Oh, 245.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.160]   Oh, and what do they have?
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.300]   $11 trillion in debt.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.540]   And now they're going to take on more.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.220]   And the markets go up on that news.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.560]   You know why?
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.340]   More stimulus.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.100]   They keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.460]   It's not Abe-nomics, it's Ponzi-nomics.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.620]   And it's in Europe.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.100]   It's in the United States.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.060]   It's in China.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.200]   It's global.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.660]   Look at the banking problems.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.620]   Listen to what the IMF said.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.160]   They're worried about Deutsche Bank.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.700]   Deutsche Bank, you look at their stocks,
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.000]   look at the stocks values of Societe Generale.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.340]   Look at Royal Bank of Scotland, not so royal.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.620]   They're down 40, 50% year to date.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.880]   Why?
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.460]   Because of exactly what you said, their exposure.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.260]   Look what's going on in Italy.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.380]   Look at the bank stocks have crashed over there.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.220]   And they're facing another crisis.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.580]   And now they're looking to get out of the EU deal
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.640]   in terms of bailing out the banks by the state.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.000]   Because they have the bail-ins.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.740]   The people are exposed, mostly,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.740]   but a majority of the bonds being bought
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.640]   in the Italian banks are owned by individuals.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.440]   They suckered the people into buying them.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.840]   So that means they're going to lose their money.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   So they're trying to save the Italian banks.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   The banking crisis is in front of us.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.080]   And these negative interest rates don't help, by the way,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.760]   because they can't loan money out
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   and get much of a return on it back
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.560]   because the rates are so low.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.680]   So in the United States,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.960]   you have a little boost in the banking profits,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.620]   but worldwide, it's a crisis.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   - So, Joe, you used the term stimulus.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.000]   And essentially, when you use the term stimulus,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.800]   we've got central banks that are literally
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.400]   printing money out of thin air.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.800]   And I think it was the economist Herbert Stein who said,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.480]   "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop."
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.280]   And that's a commonsensical way to look at this.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.400]   When does it stop?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.220]   - It stops when they stop propping up the equity markets.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.360]   When the equity markets crash, that'll be the end of it.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.760]   Look what happened with the Brexit vote.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.000]   You saw the turbulence in the equity markets.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.220]   And you heard all the central bankers,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.280]   all the governments came out and saying
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.540]   they were gonna do everything they could
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.760]   to protect the equity markets.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.120]   How about rigging the casino?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.640]   What am I, six years old?
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.420]   Take your plunge protection team and stick it.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.040]   That's not capitalism.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.480]   That's rigging the market.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.240]   And they got one over there in China.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.720]   They called it a national team.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.160]   They have one all over.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   So what I'm saying to you, Dennis,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.920]   is when these things go out of control,
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.720]   the governments come in and they bail out the two bigs.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.680]   They're buddies that don't,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.000]   they don't wanna lose a lot of money,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.440]   are gonna lose themselves.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.480]   And they wanna keep the facade going
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.240]   that everything is okay as it's collapsing.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.880]   You mentioned about stimulus.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.960]   Four words have killed capitalism.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.600]   This is not a capitalistic system.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.080]   As I said, they rigged the markets
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.200]   and we know it with rigging LIBOR rates,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.760]   4X markets, convicted of felonies.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.080]   It's not speculation.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.760]   Gold markets, rigged.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.440]   And as I said, they rigged,
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.360]   when the markets go down too low,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.740]   plunge protection team comes in and they save the day.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.640]   With stimulus, what are they buying?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.780]   Government bonds and now in Europe, corporate bonds.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.000]   Could anybody call it the merger
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.640]   of state and corporate powers, fascism?
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.200]   'Cause that's what's happened.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.840]   And so this isn't capitalism anymore.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.760]   By the deeds you shall know them
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   and the deeds prove there are not free markets,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.640]   there's not free price discovery, it's a rig game.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.720]   - So Gerald, in the time we have left,
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.080]   I'd like to get your opinion
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.300]   on the trends we're seeing politically.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.640]   We just finished in the United States,
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.040]   a primary season that saw Donald Trump
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.380]   get the Republican nomination.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.160]   I guess that's not official as we're talking here,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.200]   but assuming it will be soon.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.880]   Bernie Sanders, an admitted socialist.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   We see these fringe political candidates
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.400]   that probably wouldn't have gotten traction
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.760]   a couple election cycles ago,
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.040]   and we're seeing this worldwide.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.240]   Is this going to intensify?
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.520]   Is this a new trend in your view?
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.840]   - Yes, it absolutely is.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.040]   As I said, it's the people power trend
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.080]   that we're writing about now.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.600]   And it'll be out in the New Trends Journal
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.920]   in about two weeks.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.360]   And that is you're seeing this strong anti-establishment,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.880]   anti-status quo, anti-globalization movement.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:53.560]   When all else, when people lose everything
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.000]   and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.680]   And they're losing tolerance
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.120]   with the control parties by the elites.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.560]   And that's what all these populist movements are about.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.080]   And they're real, and they're not going to stop.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.680]   The Brexit proved it.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   And remember, the push against it,
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.800]   you even had Obama going over there
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.400]   telling the English people
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.160]   that they'd be at the back of the queue
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.320]   if they voted for Brexit.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.720]   You had Abe going over.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.480]   They had world leaders going over the UK
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.840]   telling the people to stay in.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.560]   You had the brightest and best on Wall Street
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.640]   warning of great dangers, and the people left anyway.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.920]   This is just the beginning.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.880]   It's the five-star movement in Italy.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.360]   It's part of the Podemos movement,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   but that's not really it in Spain.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.400]   It's the alternative for Deutschland in Germany.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.160]   It's the Freedom Party in Austria.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.320]   It's one after another.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.080]   It's the new people power movement.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.760]   They're tired of the ruling elite ruling them.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.360]   - Well, our guest today has been Mr. Gerald Cilente,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.160]   the founder and director of the Trends Research Journal,

[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.720]   for joining me on this week's podcast.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.200]   As I mentioned at the outset of the podcast this past week,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.520]   I also caught up with the host
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.480]   of the Radical Personal Finance podcast,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.340]   Mr. Joshua Sheets.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.840]   I'm pleased to have joining me
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.680]   on the Everything Financial radio program,
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   returning guest, Joshua Sheets.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.720]   Joshua is the host of the very popular podcast,
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.920]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.780]   And Joshua, welcome back to the program.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.140]   - Awesome to be back with you, Dennis.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.560]   - Well, Joshua, let's start by talking a bit
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.200]   about a topic that you discussed on your podcast
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.720]   of late, which caught my interest,
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.760]   and it's how to live a rich life now.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.620]   And the subhead was most material riches
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.640]   are easily accessible to you today.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.260]   Now, that's a very compelling and provocative topic.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.600]   So let's spend a little time discussing it.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.440]   And maybe to get started, define, if you would, rich life.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.200]   I think that maybe has a little bit different definition
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.180]   for just about anybody that hears it.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.440]   - Yeah, it definitely does.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.600]   And that's actually one of the major points
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.360]   that I try to bring out in my podcast
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.160]   is to get people to define it for themselves.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.920]   So I have some definitions that are important to me,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.360]   and I have some definitions that I think
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.160]   are worth other people considering.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.200]   But I want people to think,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.880]   what does a rich life mean to me?
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   And what I'm confronting is, especially for you and me,
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.040]   is in the mainstream financial planning culture,
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.760]   we have this tendency to talk about riches
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.880]   and living a rich life as something that happens
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.440]   a long time in the future,
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.960]   when we're old and gray and retired,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.640]   and when we have millions of dollars.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.540]   But I look around and I recognize
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.240]   that it's a lot easier to get there now
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.560]   than it is to wait until we're old and retired.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   And I think oftentimes we miss the aspects of riches.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.440]   One of the things that many of my listeners
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.800]   and many of my clients when I was working
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.320]   as a financial advisor would talk about
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.780]   was the aspect of financial freedom.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.040]   And one of the things that I learned
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.960]   was that financial freedom to most people
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.160]   isn't best represented by a brand new Mercedes
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.440]   in the driveway or a big, fancy luxury home on the water.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.280]   Financial freedom is usually represented by choices.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.940]   And I came to the conclusion that you could get there,
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.400]   meaning you could get to a place
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   of having control over your choices,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.280]   much faster than you could get to the position
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.680]   of being a multimillionaire.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.480]   You just make different life choices.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.400]   So I break living a rich life down
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.760]   into material aspects and immaterial aspects.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.120]   But just as an example, I think most listeners
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.080]   of your radio show or my podcast
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.880]   are already living a richer life today
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.320]   than the richest person in the world 75 years ago.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.240]   Just think about it.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.480]   Number one, climate controlled.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.320]   Almost all of our listeners right now
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.000]   are listening to us in a climate
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.960]   that's perfectly suited to their ideal body temperature.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.880]   Whether it's cooled or heated,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.320]   they're already enjoying that.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.840]   Think about how hot it would have been
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.240]   for the richest person in the world 75 years ago
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.480]   or how cold it would have been in some places
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.040]   and how much easier we have it.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.120]   And yet when's the last time you heard somebody
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.640]   express appreciation for the simple comfort
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.080]   and convenience of a climate controlled environment?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.160]   Or think about the access to information
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.380]   and education and entertainment.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.600]   Today, every one of our listeners
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.920]   has a smartphone in their pocket
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.880]   or sitting on their car dashboard
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.480]   that has access to entertainment,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.420]   unlimited amounts of entertainment
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.300]   for essentially free right on YouTube
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.980]   from all around the world.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.120]   That's a luxury that the richest person in the world
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.600]   didn't have access to even 50 years ago.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.200]   And yet today we take it for granted
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.020]   and we grumble about the fact that our car isn't brand new
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.340]   while we have access to some of the riches
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.140]   that you couldn't even achieve 50 years ago.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:23.400]   - So when you mention financial freedom
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.280]   and define that by saying control over choices,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.040]   could you expand on that a bit?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.640]   - Sure, I think that, and on my show I've done,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.000]   I did the immaterial aspects of riches
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   and the material aspects.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.720]   And I like to disconnect them
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.200]   because we are so suckered in to a losing game
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.720]   by the advertising media on all sides
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.360]   that causes us to think that we somehow need
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.520]   a lot of material things to be rich.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.400]   But if you actually think about it,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.760]   you can, the feelings of richness
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.260]   are often evoked by your choice.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.760]   I can live a rich life by having an afternoon free
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.040]   from work that I don't wanna do
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.720]   to sit and read a book or watch a movie
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.960]   or do something that I do wanna do.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   And so what I think people want from being rich is control.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.040]   They want control over their day.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.060]   They want control over their time.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.160]   They want control over the choice of their activities.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   Well, that can be achieved
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.440]   without yet becoming a multimillionaire.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.480]   If you want control over your day,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.120]   then transition from a job or a career
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.900]   that doesn't allow you that control
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.220]   to something that does allow you that control.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.700]   I'm 31 years old and my birthday
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.980]   was just a couple weeks ago.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.700]   And I consider myself at this point in time,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.020]   financially free.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.860]   Why?
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.680]   Because I'm a multimillionaire?
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.520]   No, I'm not there yet.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.340]   I'm working towards it, but I'm not there yet.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.460]   But I consider myself financially free
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.740]   because I left a career and job
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.820]   that had a tremendous amount of control
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.160]   and I started my own business
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.180]   that gives me full control over my day.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.540]   I can start my day at any time that I want.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.960]   I can do the work that I've chosen to do.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.160]   I don't accept a lot of external calendar appointments
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.480]   on my schedule, so I have control over when I do my work.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.000]   And that gives me a tremendous amount of freedom.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.580]   Now, it's not the freedom that's ultimately best enjoyed
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.960]   by having a stream of dividend income
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.640]   from publicly traded companies
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.480]   that's much higher than my expenses
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.640]   that I can just sit back and do nothing.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.800]   I still need to work.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.040]   But having that control to choose work that's meaningful
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.440]   makes me feel financially free.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.100]   At the end of the day, we all know
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.900]   that life is composed primarily of our experiences
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.720]   and not so much our things.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.640]   When we're dead and gone,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.780]   our things are gonna stay here with us.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.220]   We can't use them anymore.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.100]   And most people, when they get to the end of their life,
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.520]   they're gonna be much more concerned
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.080]   with their experiences,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.140]   the richness of their relationships,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.920]   the diversity of their experience,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.700]   the richness of life
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.360]   that's not just measured by material things.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.160]   - So essentially, Joshua,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.040]   financial freedom is somewhat time freedom.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.720]   And in your case, as I was listening to you explain
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   or describe your personal transition
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.140]   going from a job to a business,
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.800]   that's probably something that many of our listeners
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.040]   envy very much.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.840]   Can you talk about how you would go about
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.360]   planning such a transition?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.580]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.560]   The key thing is to first recognize
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.220]   that it's something that you actually want.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.900]   Many people have ideas and dreams
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.400]   about how great running their own business is.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.160]   And then those ideas and dreams
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   can be shattered by actual experience.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.600]   I think every business owner has had the opportunity,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   has had the thought at some point
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.760]   in their entrepreneurship game,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.120]   "Man, I wish I could just go back
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.780]   "to the world of employment."
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.600]   I don't recommend that everybody become an entrepreneur.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.240]   It's tough, it's challenging.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.640]   So be sure that it's something that you want.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.140]   The next thing is to recognize
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.600]   that there are gonna be some benefits from it
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.720]   and there are going to be some costs and some drawbacks.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.160]   So you need to list those benefits out
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.480]   and you need to recognize what you're giving up.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.100]   But the transition to entrepreneurship is relatively simple.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.600]   You find something that the marketplace is going to value
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.560]   that you want to provide
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.600]   and then you build a business model behind it
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.660]   that'll work.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.760]   You can also and should also pay very careful attention
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.240]   to some of the formal technical financial planning techniques
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.440]   that we teach in order to make it a good transition.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.920]   You can go out and start a business
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.400]   when you're completely broke and deeply in debt.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   It's really stressful.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.400]   Now, if you're in that situation,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.440]   I recommend you still consider doing it,
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.120]   but it's also very wise
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.440]   to get yourself on a solid foundation.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.080]   I think the best way for most people
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.000]   to approach transition is to do it on a part-time basis.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.360]   Work a full-time job,
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.820]   start a business on the side on a part-time basis.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.800]   That way you're not putting too much risk on the side gig.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.760]   And then when you get to the point in time
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.080]   where you can see some clear and measurable things
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.160]   that you could do to increase the business
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.080]   to a point where it's able to support yourself,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.320]   then go ahead and start pursuing that transition
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.520]   to a full-time business.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   >> So when we talk about entrepreneurship, Joshua,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.760]   this becomes a pretty important topic
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.960]   given where the economy is today.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.640]   I interviewed Mr. Gerald Salente of Trends Research Institute
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.560]   and during our interview,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.360]   he pointed out that actual real income is down
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.160]   for the average American over the last 18 years.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   And even according to the US Department of Labor
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.780]   and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.680]   median household income is down over the last five years.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   So this is becoming really almost a necessity
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.700]   for some people.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.240]   So if someone has this as an idea,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   but they don't really have any skills
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.320]   in the area of becoming an entrepreneur,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.220]   what advice would you give them to go acquire those skills?
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.480]   >> The key advice that people in that situation need
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.560]   is a change of mindset.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.800]   You're right about the trends in our economy
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.600]   and it's only going to get worse in the future.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.080]   We've been done a disservice as a society
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.600]   wherein we've primarily been taught the concept
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.980]   that if you just get a good job, everything will be fine.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.440]   But there are a number of pressures and stresses
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.760]   that are collaborating to make that no longer the case.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.040]   If you notice how many of the unemployment rolls,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.840]   or how many of the employment,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   the jobs, many of them disappeared
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.560]   after the 2008 recession.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.320]   Many of those jobs have not come back
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.280]   and will not come back.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.880]   And the pressure is only going to get more and more intense.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.640]   I pay a lot of attention to the developments of automation.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.120]   And frankly, I feel very, very bad.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.080]   I feel bad for many of the people who are working hard.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.620]   For example, the fast food industry,
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.140]   striking and trying to pressure for
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.340]   what they call a living wage,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.900]   increases in the minimum wage.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.660]   The problem with that type of approach,
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.740]   the problem with striking for more money
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.020]   is that employers are consistently looking
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.380]   to remove your job and to transfer that
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.380]   to some sort of automated system.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.980]   And I would guess within about five years,
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.700]   most of us will be completely accustomed
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.620]   and comfortable with ordering our food
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.140]   through a computer instead of through a person.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.500]   So the key mindset is not looking to say,
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.520]   "What can I get?"
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.540]   That's the mindset that leads to me striking
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.520]   and advocating and trying to get people
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.500]   to give me more money.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.900]   I'm looking for what I can get.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.500]   The mindset of an entrepreneur is looking to,
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.460]   "What can I give?
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.100]   "What service can I provide?"
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.900]   And so the first thing to do is to look around
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.620]   where you are and try to see,
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.700]   what is something that I have the capability
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.380]   to offer to somebody else
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.540]   that they might be willing to pay me for?
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.060]   That's the fundamental transformation of entrepreneurship.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.820]   Now, if you don't know, just look around
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.340]   and see what other people are doing.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.540]   And ask yourself, "Can I do what other people do?"
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.220]   And you can do this at any level.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.780]   For example, a couple of neighborhood kids
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.460]   in my neighborhood, they've been off on summer vacation
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.580]   over the last few months,
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.300]   and they started a car washing business.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   And there's three young men, eight years old,
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.020]   one nine years old, the other, and 10 years old, the third.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.900]   And they came by my house, knocked on my door,
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.940]   and asked me if I wanted my car washed.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.440]   They had a bucket, ready to go.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.740]   They're using my hose, their bucket, their soap,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.000]   and they're washing my car for me.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.740]   Well, they've gone and they've created
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.860]   a little tiny business simply based on going around
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.940]   and asking people, "Would you like me to wash your car?"
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.940]   That's the fundamental basis of entrepreneurship
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.140]   of every kind.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.260]   You're just looking for something
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.140]   that people might be willing to pay you for,
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.980]   and then asking them, "Would you be willing to pay me?"
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.360]   Now, the good way to start is with something
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.880]   that you have the skills and capabilities of doing.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.340]   An eight-year-old young man is probably not going
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.380]   to have the capacity to do comprehensive financial planning
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.940]   like I do, but his business is no different than mine.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.980]   And if you find an area where you think
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.180]   you might have a product or a service
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.820]   that somebody might be willing to buy,
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.860]   you offer that, you put that out in the marketplace,
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.680]   and you see if there's any interest.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.460]   Then you go back and you try to develop
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.760]   additional businesses and services behind it.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.380]   Car washing business, I've kind of took these young guys
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.940]   under my wing, and I'm trying to counsel them
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.580]   and give them some additional ideas.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.600]   Okay, here are some additional products that you can offer.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.060]   You're offering a basic wash,
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.780]   but what about a basic wash and a vacuum?
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.940]   Well, we don't have a vacuum.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.160]   Okay, so you need to go out and get a vacuum,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.200]   acquire the tools, build the skills.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.520]   That skill is pretty simple.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   What about some other skills you can offer?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.720]   Can you wax cars?
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.600]   Well, we don't know how to do that.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.280]   All right, well, go learn the skills.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   Now, I'm using a simple example
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.400]   because I think it's something that we can all relate to.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   And today, if I lost all of my money,
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.080]   if I lost all of my business,
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.360]   I would go now and consider starting a car washing business
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.880]   'cause that's something that I can go and I can sell.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   I can go door to door.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.900]   I can ask people if they'd like their car washed,
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.680]   and I could build a business on it.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.840]   There are tons and tons and tons of these,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.160]   all throughout our society.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.520]   And if you just start paying attention
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.080]   to what's something I can provide to the marketplace,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.880]   then your mindset will open up the opportunities to you.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.320]   - Well, we are chatting today with Joshua Sheets.

[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.920]   I'll continue my conversation with Joshua

[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.420]   Stay with us.

[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.360]   And I'm gonna get back to the conversation I had with him
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   this past week right now.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.200]   I have the pleasure of chatting today with Joshua Sheets.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.680]   Joshua is the host of the podcast,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.380]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.280]   I would encourage you to check it out.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.840]   And we're chatting today with Joshua
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.880]   about how to live a rich life now.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.920]   And on your podcast, Joshua,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.100]   you talked about the fact that it's possible
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.520]   to build a plan to achieve financial freedom in 10 years.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.120]   So the floor is yours.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.560]   Our listeners, I'm sure, would love to hear that.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.160]   - This show, I just finished this series of three shows
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.240]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.760]   And it came because I've done over 350 episodes
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.600]   of the podcast.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.360]   And the tagline of my show is how to live a rich life now
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.200]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.040]   in 10 years or less.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.240]   And I've done hundreds of shows.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.160]   I never had fully explained that.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.640]   So that was where I came into this series.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.880]   But I'm convinced that you don't have to wait
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.180]   for a 40-year retirement plan
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.680]   in order to live a lifestyle of financial freedom.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.760]   And that there are many paths to financial freedom.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.840]   Now notice I'm being careful with my words.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.160]   I'm using the word freedom.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.460]   I didn't say 10 years, how to be a multimillionaire
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.400]   in 10 years or less,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.320]   although I believe that it's possible for many people.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.840]   I didn't necessarily even say
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.080]   how to be financially independent,
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.560]   free, independent of the need to work in 10 years or less,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.920]   although I believe that is possible for many people.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.480]   I talked about financial freedom.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.680]   And the reason is that in my work as a financial planner,
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.760]   I noticed that so many people get so focused
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.040]   on only being financially free when they're 65 years old
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.820]   and have a million and a half dollars.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.080]   But guess what?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.040]   That you don't have to wait until then
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.880]   to experience financial freedom.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.900]   And if you put all of your focus and hope
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.320]   on that future experience,
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.160]   you miss out on some of the aspects
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.680]   of financial freedom today.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.240]   So I cover the basic aspect of financial freedom.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.360]   For example, having your income higher than your expenses.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.440]   If you have your income higher than your expenses,
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.260]   then to a great degree, you are financially free,
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.800]   just simply because you have more money coming in
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.900]   than you need to spend.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.740]   Now, even better, if you could have that income coming in
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.560]   in a way that's ideally suited for you
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.720]   through a job that's appropriate to you
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.800]   or through a business that's appropriate to you,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.320]   now you've got an even higher degree of freedom.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.080]   If you look at the wealthy,
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.280]   notice the fact that the mega rich don't ever retire.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.680]   Donald Trump's running for president.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.360]   He wants the hardest and worst job in the world,
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.720]   even though he doesn't need it.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.680]   He wants it.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.320]   Well, why is he trying to get one of the hardest jobs
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.000]   in the world when he doesn't need it?
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.960]   Because it's something more than money.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.200]   And if you look at all of the wealthy,
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.720]   you almost never see that they retire.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.560]   Why?
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.800]   Because they've found an occupation that fits them
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.100]   and they're financially free,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.520]   even though they're still working.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.340]   Well, don't wait to be a billionaire.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.280]   Just find that occupation now.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.840]   Another aspect, being debt-free.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.360]   If you're debt-free, that gives you a huge degree
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.480]   of financial freedom.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.040]   Gives you choices over your life.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.520]   And then I also go in and I explain
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.920]   that in 10 years or less,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.480]   you probably can build a plan for financial freedom,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.920]   complete financial freedom.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.880]   It's as simple as if you're an employee,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.520]   if you live on about 30% of your income
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.840]   and save 70% of your income,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.060]   you can be financially independent in about a decade.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.680]   Well, that's easy?
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.520]   No.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.200]   But many people can do that and are doing that.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.760]   And you can make a plan in a decade
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.640]   to dramatically increase your income,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.240]   to decrease your expenses and save a lot of money.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.120]   There are thousands of people all around the US
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.240]   that are doing that.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.920]   If you don't believe me, I'll send you to the forums
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.160]   where they're all interacting.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.280]   Or you can build a plan to build a business.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.660]   If you need to have that multimillion dollar approach,
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.040]   you can build a plan to build a business
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.860]   and sell it out in under a decade.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.060]   Now, is that guaranteed?
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.000]   No, that's difficult.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.660]   Most businesses fail.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.500]   But is it possible?
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.320]   It sure is.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.480]   And so, depending on your financial plan,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.100]   you'll set out different goals,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.440]   depending on what you're trying to accomplish,
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.600]   and you'll be able to accomplish them.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.040]   But I don't believe you have to wait
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.720]   until you're 65 years old and have $2 million
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.560]   in your 401(k) to enjoy the fruit
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.100]   of a rich life now or financial freedom.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.700]   You can achieve it far faster.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.440]   - And Joshua, you made just a very basic point.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.840]   In fact, I wrote a book called "Finding Financial Freedom,"
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.360]   and I made the same point in that book.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.840]   The first thing you have to do is get to a point
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.880]   that your income is higher than your expenses.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.840]   And it might be interesting to talk about the fact
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.640]   that sometimes it's easier to increase income
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.280]   than it is to reduce expenses.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.280]   I think they both have their place.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.920]   Expenses, for many people, are so loose and sloppy
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.220]   that that's easier to cut.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.480]   But for many people, they're already being very careful,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.240]   and all they need to do is adjust their income.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.740]   I remember years ago, I heard,
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.880]   I think it was Zig Ziglar tell a story.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.760]   And Zig told the story about how they had done a test,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   and they put a newspaper ad for a job
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   in two different newspapers
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.920]   in two different major metropolitan areas.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.640]   The ad was identical, qualifications,
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.600]   description of the job.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.960]   The only thing that was different was that in one ad,
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.500]   they offered something like $40,000 a year.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.840]   In the other ad, they offered some six-figure numbers,
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.040]   say $120,000 per year.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.800]   And they got five times the respondents
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.760]   for the $40,000-a-year job than the $120,000-a-year job.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.600]   Why?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.040]   Was there any difference in qualifications?
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.880]   No, the ad was the same.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.040]   It was just the number.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.980]   And so many people have not investigated
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.600]   how to earn more income,
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.920]   and thus they're walking away
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.960]   from all kinds of opportunities that are available to them
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.920]   in their current job or transitioning to a different job
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.640]   or starting a different business.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.200]   And there's so many opportunities
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.560]   for people to increase their income.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.480]   - Well, we're gonna have to leave it there.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.960]   Our guest today has been Mr. Joshua Sheets.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.400]   He's host of the podcast, "Radical Personal Finance."
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.120]   And Joshua, thank you for joining us today.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.920]   We hope you'll come back.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.760]   - I'd love to.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.320]   - Well, that concludes this week's
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.280]   Everything Financial Radio Podcast.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.720]   Glad you decided to listen in.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.740]   I'll be back again next week with some new perspectives
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.960]   from some new guest experts.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.800]   Talk to you then.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.540]   (upbeat music)
