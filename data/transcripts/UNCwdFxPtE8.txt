[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.140]   Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.040]   Jeff Cavaliere holds a master of science
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.120]   in physical therapy,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.000]   and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.740]   He did his training at the University of Connecticut stores,
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.840]   one of the top five programs in the world
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.480]   in physical therapy and sports medicine.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.440]   from his online content.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.680]   His online content includes information
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360]   about how to train for strength,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000]   how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580]   how to train for endurance,
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.000]   as well as how to rehabilitate injuries
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.120]   to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.160]   and supplementation.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.640]   I've always found his content
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.320]   to be incredibly science-based, incredibly clear,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.880]   sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.200]   It is therefore not surprising
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   that he has one of the largest online platforms
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.440]   for fitness, nutrition, supplementation,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.120]   and injury rehabilitation.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.280]   Jeff has also worked with an enormous number
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   of professional athletes
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.440]   and has served as head physical therapist
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.080]   and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.840]   Again, the content that Jeff Cavaliere has posted online
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.720]   has been so immensely useful to me over the years
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.000]   that I was absolutely thrilled to get the chance
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.820]   to sit down with him and ask him about everything
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.960]   from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.100]   that you train across the week,
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.160]   how to integrate strength training and endurance training,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.440]   when to stretch, how to stretch.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.980]   Indeed, we talked about nutrition.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.000]   We talk a bit about supplementation.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.460]   We talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.580]   in muscle and in neural control over muscle.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.240]   So one thing that's really wonderful about Jeff
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200]   is he really has an understanding of not just how muscles
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.160]   and bones and tendons and ligaments work together,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.680]   but how the nervous system interfaces with those.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.540]   We talked about the mental side of training,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.940]   including when to bring specific concentration
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.160]   to the muscles that you're training
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.920]   and when to think more about how to move weights
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.420]   through space and think more about the movements overall.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.880]   I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.180]   to be immensely useful and informative
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.640]   for your fitness practices
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.980]   and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.600]   and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.980]   one that will give you the strength that you desire,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.820]   one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire,
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.600]   one that will set you up for endurance
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.000]   and cardiovascular health,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   basically an overall fitness program.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.400]   I really feel this is where Jeff Cavaliere shines
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300]   above and beyond so many of the other PTs and fitness
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.420]   so-called influencers that are out there.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.360]   Again, everything is grounded in science.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800]   Everything is clear and everything is actionable.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   And while we do cover an enormous amount of information
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.560]   during today's episode,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   if you want to dive even deeper into that information,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.440]   you can go to athletenext.com
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.660]   where you'll find some of Jeff's programs.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.160]   You can also find him at AthleanX on YouTube.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.960]   There you will find videos, for instance,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.920]   like the how to repair or heal from lower back pain,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.800]   something that I actually followed directly
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.880]   long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32 million views.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.240]   And that is not by accident,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   is because the protocols there, again,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.880]   are surprising and actionable.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.120]   They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.480]   So I'm immensely grateful for that content.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.920]   And it extends into everything from, again,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.480]   hypertrophy, endurance, and strength training, and so on.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.900]   Again, it's athletenext.com as the website,
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.620]   athletenext on YouTube, and also athletenext on Instagram.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.580]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.820]   that we've partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.100]   We've done that for several reasons.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.140]   First of all, the quality of their supplements
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.700]   is exceedingly high.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.780]   Second of all, we wanted to have a location
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.380]   where you could find all of the supplements
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.060]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   in one easy to find place.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.400]   You can now find that place at livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.740]   In addition, Momentus Supplements ship internationally,
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.600]   something that a lot of other supplement companies
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.860]   simply do not do.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.740]   So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.820]   or you live abroad.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.580]   Right now, not all of the supplements
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.440]   that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.100]   but that catalog of supplements
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.820]   is being expanded very rapidly.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.580]   And a good number of them that we've talked about,
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.980]   some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.220]   and other aspects of mental and physical health
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.040]   are already there.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.900]   Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.780]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.760]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.500]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.720]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.760]   about science and science related tools
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.220]   to the general public.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.060]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.740]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.900]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.440]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.180]   The reason that I started taking AG1
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.540]   and the reason I still take AG1 twice a day
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.280]   is that it covers all of my foundational health needs
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.180]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.600]   As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.740]   that cover any deficiencies I might have in my diet.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.600]   It also has probiotics and the probiotics are key
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.840]   for supporting the so-called gut microbiome.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.300]   The gut microbiome are trillions of little micro bacteria
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.180]   that live in our gut from our throat
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.100]   all the way down to the base of our gut
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.340]   that support everything from our immune system
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.520]   to our hormone health, to the so-called gut brain axis.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.180]   That is our gut and our brain are in direct communication
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.620]   with one another in ways that support our mood,
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.420]   our ability to think, and overall brain health.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.900]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.820]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.020]   to claim a special offer.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.640]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.660]   which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.940]   while you're on the road.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.520]   And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.220]   Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.840]   for an enormous number of aspects of your mental health,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.060]   physical health, and performance
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.480]   by impacting things like hormone regulation,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.040]   calcium regulation, and cardiovascular health.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.980]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.520]   to claim that special offer.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.840]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.660]   with heating and sleep tracking
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.940]   and importantly, cooling capacity.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.640]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.160]   and on another podcast about the close relationship
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.580]   between temperature and sleep.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.800]   That is your body temperature has to drop
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.500]   by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.860]   and waking up involves heating up of your body
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.700]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.540]   Now, some people run cold during the night.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.160]   They need to heat their sleeping environment.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.000]   Other people run too hot during the night.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.960]   I'm one such person.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.740]   I tend to wake up in the middle of the night
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.580]   if I get warm at all.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.000]   With Eight Sleep, I'm able to cool my sleeping environment
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.060]   in a very precise way,
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.960]   even so precise that I can control the temperature
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.060]   at the beginning, middle, and end of the night
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.540]   so that I fall asleep easily, stay deeply asleep,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.740]   and wake up feeling better than I've ever felt before.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.220]   The PodPro cover by Eight Sleep
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.960]   is their most advanced solution on the market
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.380]   for thermal regulation.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.100]   It pairs dynamic cooling and heating
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.660]   with biometric tracking if you want to use that.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.540]   Also has this nice feature that it'll vibrate
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.820]   in the morning to wake you up.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.400]   I rather like that vibration feature too.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.940]   You can add the cover to any mattress
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.460]   and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.580]   or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.860]   So again, it can be customized to your sleep needs.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.820]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.140]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.720]   and check out the ProPod cover and save $150 at checkout.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.780]   They currently ship within the USA, Canada,
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.860]   and the United Kingdom.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.300]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.700]   to save $150 at checkout.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.400]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.340]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.280]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.260]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.580]   from Stanford and everything about Roka eyeglasses
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.580]   and sunglasses is made with performance in mind.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.140]   That said, the aesthetics of Roka eyeglasses
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.100]   and sunglasses is superb.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.940]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.780]   of the visual system.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.860]   And I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.900]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.660]   in order to be able to see clearly.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.140]   Roka understands this and has developed their eyeglasses
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.780]   and sunglasses in a manner such that when you move
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.840]   from say a shady area to a brightly lit area,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.980]   or when you are in different lit environments indoors,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.100]   you can always see with crystal clarity.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.340]   And they won't slip off if you sweat.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.560]   In fact, they were originally designed for exercise.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.860]   You can wear them while running or cycling,
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.100]   but they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.800]   So unlike a lot of so-called performance or exercise glasses
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.860]   that are out there that make people frankly look
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.620]   like cyborgs in my opinion,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.700]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses look terrific.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.220]   You'd be proud to wear them to work or out to dinner
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.100]   or when you exercise.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.180]   If you want to try Roka glasses, you can go to roka.com,

[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.420]   And now for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.940]   Jeff, such a pleasure for me to have you here.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.680]   - I'm glad to be here, it's amazing.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.420]   - I'm a long time consumer of your content.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.280]   I've learned a tremendous amount about fitness,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.560]   both in the weight room, cardio, nutrition,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.100]   things that I've applied for over a decade.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.460]   So for me, this is particularly meaningful.
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.620]   And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.580]   to which I'm interested in the answers,
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.820]   but also for which I know the audience
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.500]   is really curious about.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.180]   So one of your mantras is,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.180]   if you want to look like an athlete, train like an athlete.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.900]   And I think that's something really special
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.040]   that sets aside what you do
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.740]   from what a lot of other very well qualified people do.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.220]   And in terms of the use of weights and resistance,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.820]   whether or not it's body weight or weights in the gym
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.180]   or pulleys versus cardio,
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.540]   you know, in terms of overall health, aesthetics,
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.800]   and athleticism, is there a way that you could point to,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.140]   you know, the idea that maybe people should be doing,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.420]   you know, 50% resistance training and 50% cardio,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.400]   maybe it's 70/30, maybe it's 30/70.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.760]   And here I'm talking about the typical person
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.300]   who would like to maintain,
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.540]   or maybe even add some muscle mass,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.860]   probably in particular areas for most people,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.260]   as opposed to just overall mass,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.620]   although we'll talk about that later.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.900]   And people want to maintain a relatively low body fat
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.340]   percentage and being good cardiovascular health.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.260]   What's the sort of contour of a basic program
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.460]   that anybody could think about as a starting place?
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.500]   - I think it's like a 60/40 split,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.020]   which would be leaning towards weight training,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.740]   you know, strength, and then, you know,
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.620]   the conditioning aspect be about 40%.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.900]   So if you look at it over the course of a training week,
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.420]   I mean, five days in a gym would be a great task.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.500]   And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.980]   but three days strength training,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.900]   Monday, Wednesday, Friday, conditioning,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.340]   Tuesday, Thursday, you know, two days.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.740]   It's a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.740]   Of course, depending upon training goals,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.220]   and as you said, the aesthetic goals,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.100]   like that will shift dramatically,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.940]   but if you want to see the benefits of both,
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.100]   that's probably the effective dose for strength training
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.820]   and the effective dose for conditioning
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.980]   at the bare minimum level.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.020]   Again, being a much better performer condition wise,
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.420]   you're going to want to do more than that.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.180]   - And in terms of the duration of those workouts,
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.340]   what's your suggestion?
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.460]   I've been weight training for about 30 years,
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.380]   running for about 30 years, and mainly for health,
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.500]   and have found that if I work hard in the gym
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.020]   or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so,
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.420]   it's very hard for me to recover.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.340]   I start getting colds.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.460]   I start getting weaker from workout to workout.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.260]   But amazingly, at least to me,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.540]   if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes of warmup
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.020]   and 50 five zero minutes or so of really hard work
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.500]   for resistance training,
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.380]   and I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 to 45 minutes,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.060]   I feel great, and I seem to make some progress
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.900]   at least someplace in the workout from workout to workout.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.180]   - Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.780]   'cause those are kind of numbers that we usually preach.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.700]   We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less if possible.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.180]   Now, depending upon the split that you're following,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.980]   if you're on a total body split,
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.060]   there's just going to be more that has to be done
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.980]   in a given amount of time.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.380]   That again, if you're training primarily for strength,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.620]   that could prolong the workout
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.780]   'cause the longer rest times in between sets.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.740]   But in general, when you're not focused on that one aspect
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.100]   but the overall health picture,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.820]   then you can get the job done in under an hour.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.420]   And again, I always say,
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.220]   on top of if you want to look like an athlete,
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.140]   train like an athlete is you can either train long
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.020]   or you can train hard, but you can't do both.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.820]   And I really believe that the focus for me,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.660]   I have a busy life.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.820]   I have a lot of other things that I do, believe it or not.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.020]   And it's like, I want to go hard and I want to go get out.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.860]   And I find that my body also responds to that.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.580]   I think a lot of guys' bodies respond to that.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.860]   And particularly as you start to get older,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.740]   I think it's the length of the workout
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.860]   that actually causes more problems
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.940]   than the intensity of what you're doing.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.420]   Particularly if you're warmed up properly like you said.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.340]   I've found personally that my warmup
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.820]   has had to become more of an integral part of my workout
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.300]   than it ever has before.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.040]   I could get in the gym when I was 20
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.100]   and I'm going right over, I'm doing the one set,
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.280]   two sets, I'm ready to go.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.140]   And I never do another workout warmup set
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   for any of the other exercises I do the rest of the day.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.060]   That's not true anymore.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.920]   And I found that as long as I'm willing
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.460]   to sort of give myself a little bit of a warmup,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.380]   the intensity is not what bothers me.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.940]   I'm very much in control of the weights that I use
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.260]   and it doesn't bother me.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.620]   But if I start to go pretty long,
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.620]   I start to feel achy or I start to have problems.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.320]   So again, depending upon age,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.640]   that also plays a factor in the length.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.580]   But again, I think everybody can achieve,
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.260]   on a standard program,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.060]   can achieve the results that they want within an hour.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.100]   - In terms of splits, you mentioned splits.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.940]   And so for those who aren't familiar with this term, splits,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.620]   it's really which body parts are you training on which days?
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.340]   Seems like almost everybody follows
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.300]   a weekly workout schedule,
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.860]   although the body of course doesn't care about the week.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.740]   There's no reason to think that once every seven days
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.860]   or twice every seven days makes sense physiologically,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.020]   it's just the body doesn't work though.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.980]   But that's the way life is structured.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   I've seen you discuss three days a week whole body workouts.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.640]   I've heard of splits like a pushing one day,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.680]   pulling another day, legs another day, a day off, repeat.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.800]   I mean, there's so many variations on this.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.040]   What are some general themes that we can throw out there
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.780]   and in order to avoid the huge matrix of possibilities?
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.400]   You have some wonderful content that points to those.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.720]   And we will cap, in our caption show notes,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.360]   we will link out to some of those
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   that are different ways to design splits.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.660]   But in terms of giving people a logic
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.220]   of how to think about splitting up body parts,
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.260]   what's governing the split?
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.080]   What are the rules and the logic that dictate a split?
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.980]   For me, the first rule is will you stick to it, right?
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.240]   Like if you, 'cause there are split,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.960]   I don't particularly like full body splits.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.740]   I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.380]   Like I don't necessarily like to have to train everything.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.540]   Now, of course the volumes will come down per muscle group.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.340]   But if you don't like to do that
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.280]   and you actually don't look forward to your workout
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.160]   because you're dreading having to do everything
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.920]   and feeling maybe too fatigued
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.320]   by the time your workout's over,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.700]   or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.460]   and don't fit into your schedule,
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.440]   I don't care how effective the split is.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.340]   A split not done is not effective.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.920]   So you need to find one that fits.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.480]   So maybe you go into an alternative option
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.760]   like a push pull legs, like you mentioned.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.860]   And that could be done either one cycle through the week
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.320]   on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.200]   or it could be twice in a week.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.720]   So you're actually training six times where you repeat it,
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.340]   pull push legs, pull push legs,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.840]   or however you want to do it
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.960]   with either a day off in between the three days
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.240]   or at the end of the six days.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.360]   And again, that actually impacts your schedule.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.320]   I've broken that down before where it's,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.440]   if you put it in between the three days,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.640]   it's good because you're giving yourself
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.360]   an extra rest day in between,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.020]   but it starts to shift that day off every week
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.860]   as we wrap around.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.940]   So for those guys that were choosing that seven day schedule
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.880]   out of convenience in our heads,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.480]   it starts to mess with that off day.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.160]   So others like to just keep it predictably,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.800]   let's say on a Sunday and train six days in a row.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.220]   But that's a better way to maybe group
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.120]   similar muscle actions together,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.520]   which I think I definitely prefer that
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.000]   because if I'm going to be training, pulling movements,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.080]   at least there's a synergy between them.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.800]   And I feel like I'm looking to achieve one goal that day.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.000]   And then, I mean, quite honestly,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.080]   you can go back to the bro split days
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.320]   and those still work effectively.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.520]   There's a reason why they worked in the past.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.680]   Like, I think that science shows
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.840]   that there's smarter ways to do them these days.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.800]   Like you can come back and hit a related muscle.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.440]   So you could do, let's say biceps on one day
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.900]   and then come back two days later and do back,
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.760]   realizing again, synergy between the exercises there,
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.840]   your biceps are going to get restimulated again.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.040]   So you could figure out ways to make that work.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.080]   But the thing that I think is effective there
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.200]   is that tends to be one of the ones
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.640]   that people like the most.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.520]   Because they can go in, they get their pump,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.840]   they feel good, it's pretty solely focused
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.900]   on one muscle group.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.560]   - Is that the definition of a bro split?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.400]   One?
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.480]   - One muscle group a day, yeah.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.300]   - I see.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.280]   So it's very much geared towards strength and aesthetics,
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.640]   really maximizing chest one day.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.040]   - Probably more aesthetics than strength, yeah.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.580]   - Hence the bro name.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.960]   - Yeah, but again, in here I am a science guy
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.520]   and I can appreciate the benefits of a bro split.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.240]   Especially because again, to what end?
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.640]   Whose goal are we trying to achieve here?
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.620]   Theirs or ours?
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.140]   I mean, if I'm applying my standards and my goals
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.340]   or even athletic ideals, but they just want to get in shape,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.500]   then it's perfectly fine to do a bro split in that instance,
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.260]   if you're sticking to it again,
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.560]   and you're seeing the results that you want to see from it.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.620]   But they're able to really keep their focus on one muscle,
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.600]   they get to focus on, like look,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.080]   a lot of times people struggle with the way
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.100]   an exercise feels until their second or third set.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   Like they don't have that proprioceptive ability
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.760]   to kind of lock in on an exercise.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.440]   So spending a few, not only sets on the same exercise,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.460]   but then doing another exercise for the same muscle group
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.840]   helps them to dial in a little bit better
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.360]   and get more out of their training.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.280]   - Yeah, that raises a really interesting,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.380]   I think important question.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.680]   Early on when I started resistance training,
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.880]   which was when I was 16 in high school,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   I got in touch with, and I was learning from Mike Mentzer.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.600]   - Me too, me too, that's crazy.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.800]   - And Mike was very helpful, very, very helpful.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.640]   We got to be friendly.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.720]   - So if I just read his book,
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.840]   I didn't get a chance to be him, so I'm jealous right now.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   - Well, back then, no internet.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.400]   I paid by Western Union type thing to send him some money.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.240]   - From the back of the magazine.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.980]   - And then he got on the phone with me
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.140]   and my mother at the time was like,
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.440]   "Why is this grown man all in the house?"
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.560]   And he gave me a very straightforward split,
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.520]   which was shoulders and arms.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.040]   One day, he had me taking two days off
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.160]   and then training legs, and then two days off,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.280]   and then chest and back, et cetera.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.400]   - And that's a variation of a bro split too,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.340]   where you're sort of breaking them down that way,
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.360]   chest and back, or chest and byes.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.080]   - Yeah, and it worked very well for me.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   I probably would have, because of my age, I think,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.180]   and because I was untrained, largely untrained,
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.020]   I think it would have grown on many different programs,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.400]   but it worked very well for me.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.240]   I eventually just made that an every other day thing.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.040]   So shoulders and arms, day off, legs, day or two off,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   'cause if you hit legs right, at least for me,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.320]   I'm not training the next day.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.760]   And then I'm not doing much of anything athletic
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.200]   the next day, and chest and back, and repeat and so on.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.280]   And the reason I found that helpful
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.160]   is I almost always recovered between workouts.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.280]   The six day a week program of push, pull, legs,
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.040]   push, pull, legs, to me, seems excruciating
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.120]   from two standpoints.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.040]   One is, at least with my recovery abilities,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.340]   or lack of recovery abilities,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.600]   I can't imagine coming back feeling fresh.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.680]   And the other one is, if I'm in the gym
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.220]   more than four days a week, I really start to fatigue it
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.560]   about the whole psychological experience of it.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   Whereas if I'm in there three or four days a week,
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.540]   in other words, if I put a day off in between each workout,
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.080]   I really want to be there,
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.160]   and I get in there with a lot of fire.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.900]   And I'm also doing other things on the off days.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.200]   So I think that I love that you mentioned
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   the split that you'll stick to,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.140]   and that you can bring the intensity to,
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.200]   because I think that that's really important.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.400]   I sometimes hear about two a day training.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   I've done two a day training twice in my lifetime,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.000]   both times I got sick two days later.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.520]   That's correlation, not causation, you know?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.560]   But is there ever an instance
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.060]   where two a day weight training makes sense
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.060]   for the non-drug assisted, typical recovery ability person?
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.680]   - I actually, I think it makes sense in some scenarios,
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.240]   but it doesn't make sense practically
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.360]   for a lot of people's schedules.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.560]   So like, if you could break down,
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.120]   let's say you were gonna do even some version
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.200]   of a total body session,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.400]   or maybe like you're gonna do an upper lower split, right?
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.520]   You could do an upper workout and do the anterior chain
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.600]   or the pushing portion of that in one session,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.760]   and then come back and do the pulling session later on
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.160]   at night if you had the opportunity to.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.520]   The thing that you benefit from there
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.060]   is the freshness of focus.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.860]   Again, like something in my head is sacrificed
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.980]   by the time you get towards the latter half
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.400]   of whatever workout you're in.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.580]   To the same point you made before,
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.740]   like when you start to approach that 50 minutes,
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.660]   an hour mark, you are either losing focus,
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.060]   you're losing energy, you're losing contractile ability,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.400]   you're losing something.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.220]   And if you're relegating whatever it is,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.700]   the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout,
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.580]   something suffers so that, okay,
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.940]   if they realize that's happening,
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.100]   then maybe you switch them up
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.160]   the next time you do the workout
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.740]   where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first,
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.100]   and then the pushing goes later,
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.540]   so you're at least not just continuing that cycle.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.780]   But at the same time,
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.180]   if you were able to kind of split them up,
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.840]   you get a chance to kind of take a break,
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.820]   you could have that freshness of focus again,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.620]   and you could actually get a better effort in.
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.740]   'Cause again, I think effort drives the results.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.620]   So if the effort is not compromised,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.020]   then you should be able to do that.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.980]   But systemically, is that a problem?
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.860]   And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.580]   It's just hard to,
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.020]   it's hard to rev the engine up a lot of times during the day.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.460]   You know, you warm that thing up once,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.500]   it's like that car in the winter,
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.000]   you get it going once, you're lucky.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.740]   Okay, now you got to drive it the rest of the day.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.500]   But, you know, you put it in the garage
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.080]   and try to start the next day, it's a problem.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.220]   So, you know, young people can get away
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.860]   with a lot more than older people could, you know?
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.780]   - Well, I've never had a strong recovery quotient,
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.180]   but if I stick to this one day off in between,
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.480]   every once in a while, two days in a row of training,
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.740]   maybe because I have to travel
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.220]   and I want to make sure I get all the workouts
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.260]   and kind of thing, I seem to be okay.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.920]   I like your example of warming up the car,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.100]   spoken like a true East Coast,
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.100]   or those of us from the West Coast took a moment there,
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.500]   but folks from the East Coast and the Midwest get it,
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.080]   and certainly from Europe.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.960]   In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.020]   and resistance training, same day, different day,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.280]   which one should come first, which one should come second?
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.700]   If one's main goals, again,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.740]   everyone listening has different goals,
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.120]   most people would like to either maintain
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.540]   or gain some muscle.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.460]   I don't know many people that want to lose muscle,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.680]   but maintain or gain some muscle,
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.360]   usually in specific locations on their body.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.000]   Most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.920]   There are a few people out there
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.680]   that are either naturally lean
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.460]   or actually just want to gain weight,
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.180]   but assuming that people want to get leaner,
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.820]   put on some muscle, maintain muscle,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.900]   and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain,
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.040]   which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.020]   how would you incorporate the cardiovascular work
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.660]   into the overall weekly regimen?
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.300]   - So again, I think that the bare minimum
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.780]   is probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular,
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.300]   if you want to have some semblance
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.460]   of cardiovascular conditioning.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.940]   But I think most people who actually need it more
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.020]   or want to pursue it more than that
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.800]   are going to need more time to do that.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.860]   So at some point it can't just be relegated to a day off
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.780]   or a day off from the weight training workouts.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.260]   So at some point it has to occur on the same day.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.740]   And in that case, I just like to put it,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.940]   if that is not your primary goal,
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.060]   but you're looking more for just the overall picture,
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:56.980]   the aesthetics you mentioned,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.680]   putting muscle on in certain areas,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.300]   then I would put it at the end of the workout.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.740]   'Cause you don't want to in any way compromise
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.020]   the weight training workout.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.500]   And as we've sort of referenced a couple of times already,
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.700]   the intensity of those workouts is important.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.180]   And we know there's a strength component to those workouts
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.060]   also that is going to be a helpful stimulus for growth.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.460]   So the conditioning, the cardio,
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.560]   that stuff done prior to any strength training workout
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.660]   is likely going to impair your ability
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.140]   to perform at your best.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.300]   So unless it's just done for a quick little warmup
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.460]   in the beginning, but then it's not sustained long enough
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.100]   really to be a benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.800]   So I just like to put that at the end,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.360]   realizing that even if my effort level is lower,
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.900]   my output is lower,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.820]   if it's still placing a demand on my cardiac output
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.020]   to get that conditioning effect because I'm fatigued,
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.760]   it still has a demand on my cardiac output.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.140]   So it's still achieving its goal,
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.340]   but it didn't interfere with my main goal
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.780]   of being able to increase my performance in the gym.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.620]   - Got it.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.260]   And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training,
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.180]   I've seen you do a number of, I have to say,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.200]   very impressive high intensity interval type work.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.540]   So burpee type work or pushups with crunches
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.380]   mixed into them.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.820]   Anyway, people can see your videos.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.780]   I didn't describe those in the best way,
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.980]   but rather than on the treadmill
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.980]   or out jogging for 30, 45 minutes,
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.020]   is that because you prefer higher intensity,
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.260]   higher heart rate type training,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.420]   or is it because you live in cold Connecticut
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.300]   and you don't want to be out jogging on the roads
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.160]   in the middle of winter?
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.300]   - I think all of the above.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.500]   I mean, those are factors from a personal level,
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.100]   but I think that if you are,
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.620]   if we could blend function across these realms
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.060]   and not have such a delineation between
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.460]   this is my weight training and this is my conditioning,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.300]   but figure out a way to blend them together,
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.820]   I always think that you've got a better opportunity
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.640]   to get that more well-rounded result.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.460]   And I like to kind of mix up that straight conditioning work
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.740]   and also some of the footwork drills.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   Like we have some high expectations
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.340]   for guys that come into our programs,
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.620]   like to just do some footwork drills.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.460]   - Like ladders.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.380]   - Like ladders or line drills or something.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.220]   And you know what happens?
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.940]   People become intrigued and interested.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.780]   Like, I never, I haven't tried this since high school,
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.300]   you know, and they become interested
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.580]   in just the challenge of it.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.400]   And as we become almost distracted by the challenge,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.860]   we're now like finding ourselves conditioning, you know?
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.340]   And I always think that's an important part
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.380]   that sometimes you got to draw people in
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.820]   to show them what they might be interested in.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.120]   And from the output or the effect of it,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.900]   I just think that when you're able to blend
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.420]   some of, you know, still maintain
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.380]   some of that strength training into the exercise.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.220]   So as you mentioned,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.780]   let's say I'm doing some kind of a push-up or a burpee.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.960]   I mean, there is an anaerobic component to that
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.060]   that is going to be helpful
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.760]   rather than just walking or just jogging.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.540]   Not to say that that isn't an effective means
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.460]   for strict cardiac conditioning.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.580]   It's one of the ways that we've had for centuries,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.660]   you know, to do it.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.140]   But I just think that if we can blend it,
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.460]   then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.660]   and you get some of those crossover benefits
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.240]   and it doesn't become so segmented
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.920]   in terms of what we're trying to do.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.640]   - I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.500]   and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.980]   That's not something that I've thought of before.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.860]   And it's simply because I've overlooked it,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.820]   but it makes sense because my sister who's reasonably fit,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.540]   although I'm always trying to get her to do a bit more,
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.360]   she always asks me, you know, what should I take?
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.460]   And I believe her in supplements
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.120]   for certain people in certain instances,
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.820]   but I keep telling her, you know, behaviors are going to,
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.300]   and nutrition are going to have
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.700]   the greatest outsized positive effect.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.020]   And she loves things like dance classes and things
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.080]   or kickboxing, these kinds of things.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.600]   So it makes sense that if you can hook somebody
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.800]   on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.920]   and kind of trick them into doing more cardio,
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.600]   so to speak, that's terrific.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.920]   Also, the neuroscientist in me just has to say, forgive me,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.020]   that anytime you're engaging the, you know, the two sets
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.260]   of motor neurons, the ones in your brain,
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.020]   the upper motor neurons, and the ones in your spinal cord,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.700]   anytime you're engaging those upper motor neurons,
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.860]   which are for deliberate, well-controlled action,
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.880]   you're doing a great thing for your brain
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.080]   in terms of brain longevity.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.840]   So I'm, now I need to incorporate some actual skills
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.740]   into my training.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.220]   Going back to weight training a bit,
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.780]   one of the most important things I learned from you,
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.920]   so over the years, was that when training
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.780]   to increase muscle size, to really think not so much
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.960]   about moving weights, but more about challenging muscles.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.260]   I also heard this from my friend Ben Paculski,
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.840]   who's a very well-accomplished, he was a bodybuilder,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   now he's into other aspects of fitness, teaches fitness,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.400]   but don't move weights, challenge muscles,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.660]   unless you're trying to power lift or something of that sort,
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.340]   which I'm not, immensely helpful.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.260]   But the other thing that I learned from you
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.820]   that I combined with that was this idea
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.080]   that certain muscles will grow better
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.820]   and get stronger much more easily,
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.860]   maybe even will recover better because of our ability
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.580]   to contract them really hard.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.620]   And this, what I call the cavalier test,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.060]   which is, at least if I could paraphrase the,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.300]   so for instance, if I can, it's always the bicep, isn't it?
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.260]   Let's use the calf or the bicep.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.940]   If you can flex your bicep to the point
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.620]   where it hurts a little bit,
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.580]   like it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp,
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.860]   or you can flex your calf to the point
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.260]   where it really cramps up a little bit,
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.000]   almost feels like it's nodding up,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.500]   that's a pretty good indication
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.380]   that you're going to be able to stimulate that muscle well
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.800]   under load if you're doing the movement properly.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.420]   And that's the feeling to actually aim for each repetition,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.940]   maybe even throughout the repetition.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.460]   For me, this completely transformed my results.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.520]   And this was, I think it may be five, six years ago
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.900]   that I first heard this from you,
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.500]   body parts that for me, lagged behind,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.820]   that I thought maybe genetically
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.000]   weren't going to work for me,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.180]   immediately just started growing, right?
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.100]   And I was getting stronger and stronger.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.540]   And I thought, this is really something,
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.180]   so much so that I've dedicated a portion of my research,
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.620]   along with in collaboration with another group,
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.980]   to try and understand what's happening
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.020]   in these upper motor neurons in the brain
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.200]   that can engage the muscles even more.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.660]   And that it's not just about progressive overload
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.340]   or putting a pump into the muscle,
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.080]   that it's really, this mind-muscle connection
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.620]   is a real thing when it comes to predicting results
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.400]   and that you can get better at it.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.840]   So forgive me for paraphrasing
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.340]   your incredible content around this.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.660]   It made a tremendous difference for me
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.980]   and a number of other people that I've passed that along to.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.060]   But what can you, first of all, how did you arrive at that?
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.780]   Because we hear about the mind-muscle connection,
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.540]   but I really heard it first from you.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.360]   How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.540]   the cavalier test, as I'll call it?
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.700]   It's always weird when people name things
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:54.980]   after themselves in science,
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.820]   but other scientists can name things.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.860]   So there is now officially the cavalier test
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.140]   is whether or not you can cramp the muscle
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.360]   in the absence of load, just flexing it
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.660]   to the point where it hurts a little bit.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.840]   That would be a good indication
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.780]   that you could grow that muscle well.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.860]   So how did you come up with this?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.500]   - I mean, it just, honestly,
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.940]   it's something that made sense to me
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.440]   because during my workouts,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.340]   even as a young kid just starting out,
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.580]   I always wanted to know what is it working?
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.740]   A lot of people ask that question more so than you think.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.300]   What is this supposed to work?
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.740]   And a lot, and I don't know if you've ever noticed,
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.420]   but like when people ask that question,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.260]   if they're being trained by a trainer
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.500]   and the trainer is saying, well, just do this,
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.020]   do this exercise and they'll show you how to do it.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.260]   But then they'll say, but what is it supposed to work?
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.840]   Where am I supposed to feel this, right?
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.580]   People, they just inherently ask that question.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.080]   A lot of people will.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.340]   I was one of those that did that.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.400]   And I asked that question,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.460]   not because I knew what I was doing,
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.600]   but just because I don't know,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.200]   I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.800]   Once you do that and you start to seek that out
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.640]   and say, okay, well,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.400]   the bicep is what's supposed to be doing the work.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.740]   Then I want to make sure the bicep's doing the work, right?
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.040]   So then I would just sort of really tweak the movement
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.720]   to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.040]   or get a stronger contraction,
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.040]   knowing if that's supposed to do the job.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.300]   It wasn't until PT school that I'm learning,
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.920]   oh, well, flexion of the elbow is the brachialis
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.820]   and the biceps and the biceps responsible for supination.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.440]   I learned other components of it,
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.360]   but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.000]   what is supposed to do the job?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   So I would seek out ways to make that happen better.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.720]   And when I was able to do that,
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.740]   I could feel the stronger contraction.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.240]   And I just, I don't know what, I just, I was no visionary.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.760]   I just felt like I knew that that was going to be better
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.840]   for me if the muscle I was trying to grow
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.240]   was being stressed more effectively.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.120]   So when I was attempting to do this
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.680]   across different exercises,
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   I would notice that what I could do potentially
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.560]   on a curl where my arm is up,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.480]   where you asked me to flex my bicep, that position,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.880]   I couldn't do if I was doing a concentration curl
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.800]   or I couldn't carry over to a cable curl.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.240]   And that shouldn't really change, right?
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.520]   'Cause the function is still largely the same.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.920]   There's still elbow flexion, there's still supination.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.340]   Like, why am I not able to do it there?
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.160]   And that's where it sort of clued into me that like,
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.880]   your mind muscle connection on not just your mind
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.720]   with one muscle, but on every exercise matters.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.160]   And it varies from exercise to exercise.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.480]   And even if you don't gain muscle size from doing that,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.360]   although I think it's very hard not to,
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.400]   especially if you're not used to doing that,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.160]   there's a term I like to call muscularity,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.760]   you know, which is a difference, right?
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.340]   It's the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.120]   That improves dramatically.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.200]   You know, if you can learn how to just start
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.680]   to engage that muscle better, the muscularity,
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.320]   the resting tone of that muscle is harder,
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   it's more at attention, it's more alive, you know?
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.000]   And that's all driven from being able
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.360]   to connect better neurologically with the muscle
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.080]   that you're trying to train.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.480]   I've talked about a lot, inefficiency is really
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   what you're trying to seek in movements
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.440]   when you're trying to create hypertrophy.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.080]   When strength is your goal, efficiency of the movement
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.040]   is what you're looking for.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.480]   You're looking to have muscles tied together
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.040]   and work well efficiently, the chest, the shoulders,
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.280]   the triceps, to get a bar off of your chest
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.240]   during a bench press.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.680]   You're not looking to make it a very inefficient,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.440]   you know, leverages for your chest
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.520]   to try to grow your chest in a bench press.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.160]   You're trying to let the whole package come together
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.340]   for a greater output.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.040]   But when you're trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.200]   or even this muscularity that I talk about,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.160]   you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.960]   Right, if you don't feel the discomfort,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.320]   then you're doing something wrong.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.360]   And I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.960]   to still do that, even knowing what I'm trying to work
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.760]   and knowing what the goal of everything I'm preaching here.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.480]   It's very difficult for some muscles
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.560]   and for certain people to do this on certain muscles.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.860]   But as you mentioned, practice does help.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.280]   And the more you become consistent and deliberate
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.440]   with what you're trying to do,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.940]   the more of a result you actually get.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.520]   - It's a couple of really poor boys
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.060]   I'd like to delve into further.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.900]   First of all, my hunch was always that the muscle groups
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.740]   that grew most easily and that I could contract hardest
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.860]   without any, the first time I did the Cavalier test
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.100]   got 10 out of 10, if we give it a 10 out of 10 scale.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.200]   You know, it could just like cinch, isolate those muscles,
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.880]   cinch them, grow them easily.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.180]   I mean, there's certain body parts,
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.020]   I don't want to say which ones
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.520]   'cause it doesn't really matter,
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.600]   that I always felt like if I just did pushups,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.360]   they would grow and these muscles are far away
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.200]   from any of the muscles
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.500]   that are supposed to be involved in pushups.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.220]   Even though I like to think I'm doing pushups correctly.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.740]   You'll tell me if I'm not.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.140]   But some of that I think is genetic
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.340]   and some of that has to do with the sports
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.780]   that I played when I was younger.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.060]   So I swam, I played soccer, I skateboard.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.100]   And then later I boxed.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.100]   And so the muscles involved in those sports
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.100]   were always very easy to engage
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.300]   later when I went into the gym.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.660]   So I guess perhaps a call to parents,
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.580]   having kids do a lot of dynamic activity
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.300]   seems like it might be a good idea.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.460]   The other thing is this issue of muscularity,
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.860]   I am so glad you brought that up.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.700]   There are, I have to imagine,
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.980]   a large number of listeners who don't want to get bigger.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.320]   They don't want to take up a larger clothing size.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.340]   They don't want to take up more space.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.160]   In fact, some of them would like to take up less space,
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.440]   but they want that quality that you're describing,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.740]   which is oftentimes you hear it more in the,
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.740]   here I'm stereotyping a bit, but with kindness,
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.420]   you hear from women who are having weight training,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.980]   they say, "I don't want to get big," often.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.820]   Sometimes they do.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.820]   But most women that I've helped weight train
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.720]   or talked to about weight training say,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.420]   "I don't want to get big, I want to get toned."
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.060]   And I think what they're referring to
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.640]   is this quality of muscularity.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.000]   This idea that at resting or at close to rest,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.080]   or anytime someone reaches out and grabs a glass,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.520]   that the muscles almost look like
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.380]   they're kind of twitching underneath the skin,
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.560]   and yet it's not saran wrap skin, anatomy chart type skin.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:06.340]   So this thing of muscularity or resting tone
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.620]   has a physiological basis.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.700]   I think it's how readily the nerves
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.220]   are communicating with the muscles.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.740]   And you're saying that by learning to engage the muscles
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.220]   more actively, the resting tone or muscularity can improve.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.420]   Have you seen that both in men and women?
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.260]   - Yeah. - Oh yeah.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.740]   - And do you think this is something
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.920]   that takes upkeep, maintenance,
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.220]   or that once you develop that in a muscle,
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.620]   you can just kind of let it coast?
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.140]   - So I think everything requires upkeep.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.500]   Use or lose it, I do believe firmly.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.900]   But I think that the development of the connection
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.140]   is gonna be harder than the maintenance of the connection.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.780]   As I said, I still struggle to this day myself
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.260]   with unnamed muscle groups also.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.820]   But there's just certain areas
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.660]   that are harder for your brain for whatever reason
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.820]   to just develop that connection at that type of level
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.660]   to create that extra strong contraction.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.900]   But I think that with proper dedication and focus,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.140]   I'll go right out and say,
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.180]   calves is one of the areas
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.700]   that I don't necessarily have a great connection with.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.320]   And I also obviously must not care so much
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.020]   'cause I don't put in the time and effort
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:18.300]   to create that connection as I could.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.620]   So I think what might happen is,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.880]   yeah, there could be a struggle there,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.220]   but then with struggle comes disinterest.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.300]   'Cause you're like, well, screw it, I'm a calf knot
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.660]   and I'm not gonna do anything about it.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.580]   So I think if you put the required effort in
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.020]   and the time and repetitions that you will develop that.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.100]   And once you do develop it,
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.420]   it's gonna stick around a lot longer than it would
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.500]   had you not invested any time into it at all.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.820]   Not requiring as much of that.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.620]   But I mean, I don't know,
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.520]   you mentioned now when you train, it's like,
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.720]   this is just part of how you train now.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.740]   Like you're going hard,
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.420]   you're trying to really forcefully contract.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.280]   You're not just moving the weight,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.060]   I say from point A to point B,
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.420]   but you're like trying to contract the weight
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.200]   through that range.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.300]   That is a mindset that I try to put into
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.460]   what everything I'm doing,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.240]   unless of course I'm focused on a strength exercise
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.120]   where I'm just trying to lift a greater amount
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.860]   and use all the muscles together.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.680]   But when the goal is inefficiency for hypertrophy,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   I am really trying to create that contraction
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.360]   and it's just part of my training.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.900]   So I guess that for consistency's sake,
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.360]   as long as I'm training, it's happening.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.520]   If I get away from training, then it's not happening at all.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.780]   But even there, I probably,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.000]   another embarrassing admission,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.480]   probably will mindfully do it throughout the day,
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.180]   even with the weight in my hand,
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.260]   in certain muscle groups,
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.900]   whether it be my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.980]   I'm doing something just to sort of engage the muscles.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.620]   And I do think that some of that sort of inane practice
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.860]   actually helps by the time you go back into the gym.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.220]   You just kind of keep that connection going.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.900]   - Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity,
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.840]   the fire together, wire together mantra,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.060]   which is the words of my colleague, Carla Schatz,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.420]   hold true for all aspects of neural function,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.060]   including nerve to muscle.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.660]   So these flexing throughout the day
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.060]   or the deliberate isolation
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.180]   of contracting a muscle throughout the day
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.020]   is without question engaging neuroplasticity.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.820]   And if you were to do fewer of those repetitions,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.360]   you're going to get less engagement
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.780]   of the nerve to muscle connection.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.100]   I can say this with a smile and with confidence,
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.540]   because one of the first things
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.840]   all neuroscience students learn
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.440]   is about the neuromuscular junction,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.860]   because it's a really simple example
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.740]   of where the more times the nerve fires
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.200]   and gets the muscle to contract,
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.540]   the stronger that connection gets,
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.380]   receptors are brought there, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   There's a whole bunch of mechanisms
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.120]   for the topic of another podcast.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.620]   But basically that practice throughout the day
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.900]   makes total sense and works.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.260]   - Yeah, and there's no, believe me,
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.660]   there's no science behind that
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.420]   in terms of the application of it.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.340]   You do it when, you catch yourself doing it
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.260]   from time to time, you know?
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.900]   But it is definitely something that's easily done
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.220]   discreetly and you wind up doing it.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.120]   I actually, I think in a recent video
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.020]   when I did talk about growing your arms
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.340]   by just improving the connection,
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.240]   not that that connection itself is applying any load
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.540]   or resistance that's significant
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.940]   to create overload for growth,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.280]   but it's the development of that connection
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.080]   that I then take back with me into the gym
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.440]   at a more effective level
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.100]   that takes every exercise I do there
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.180]   and makes it more effective.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.020]   - That's like sharpening the blade.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.860]   - So to speak.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.420]   Yeah, certainly obeys the laws
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.640]   of nerve to muscle physiology.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.200]   Want to just touch on a couple of things.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.300]   If the goal is to challenge muscles
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   and one is dividing their body into,
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.460]   let's say, you know, a three or four day a week split or so,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.760]   or maybe up to six,
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.220]   how do you know when a muscle
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.060]   is ready to be challenged again?
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.180]   I've heard, okay, every 48 hours
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.260]   is, you know, protein synthesis increases
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.420]   and then we'll get into this.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.700]   And then it drops off.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.500]   But frankly, if I train my legs hard,
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.660]   I can get stronger from workout to workout,
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.300]   or at least better in some way,
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.260]   workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.460]   training them once every five to eight days.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.900]   If I train them more often, I get worse.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.180]   So whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.940]   somehow my legs don't obey that,
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.380]   but you know, or maybe something else is wrong with me,
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.580]   but I'm sure there are many things else wrong with me,
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.880]   but how do you assess recovery at the local level,
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.420]   meaning at the level of the muscles?
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.140]   So we'll talk about soreness and getting better,
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.940]   stronger, more repetitions, et cetera.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.300]   And then the systemic level,
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.820]   the level of the nervous system.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.980]   And I'd love for you to tell us about the tool that,
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.940]   again, I learned from you,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.180]   which is actually using a physical scale,
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.940]   because it turns out this is,
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.540]   that will let you tell what the tool is,
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.620]   but that tool is also actively being used
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.820]   for assessing cognitive decline
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.320]   and cognitive maintenance and cognitive function
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.820]   in people with Alzheimer's and dementia.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.980]   - Makes total sense, makes total sense.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   I, all right, so regarding the first part of the question,
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.040]   like, you know, how do you,
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.540]   how would you kind of dictate when a muscle's recovered?
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.460]   So I do think that what you're experiencing is totally real,
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.200]   that different muscles recover at different rates.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.140]   And I've always been so fascinated by this concept
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.980]   I've talked about internally with my team,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.840]   but like, I feel like what we really need,
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.460]   the holy grail to training is going to be
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.660]   when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.700]   when a muscle is recovered,
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.540]   and that is going to dictate its training schedule.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.940]   And the fact that you might have a bicep
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.420]   that could be trained, you know, via a pulling workout,
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.780]   a regular bicep dedicated workout,
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.780]   forget the split at the moment,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.100]   you might have a bicep that's able to be trained
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.900]   that can be trained again the next day, you know,
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.740]   and then the next day.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.220]   And then maybe you need a day off after that.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.860]   But like, you know, in that,
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.140]   that can vary from person to person for sure.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.780]   And it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.260]   over the course of time, as you mentioned,
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.500]   'cause the systemic recovery is going to impact
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.680]   all those muscles anyway.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.260]   But let's say you're systemically recovering,
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.420]   every muscle itself is going to have a, you know,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   a recovery rate.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.560]   And I think what's fascinating is that
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.900]   when you talked about before,
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.340]   we like to train this week,
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.220]   or we have like the way our mind looks at training.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.700]   Well, if that was the case with the biceps,
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.620]   that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.440]   You know, where it's like,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.220]   why does it have to be also at the end of every eighth day
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.460]   or, you know, or whatever,
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.740]   when it might respond better to something
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.740]   much more frequently.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.980]   And your legs are also being thrown into that mix.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.500]   There's a Mike Mentzer concept where he's like,
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.700]   you know, training, you know,
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.000]   one set and be done for 14 days.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.120]   I mean, you know, there's such variability
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   between muscle groups
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.160]   and you're linking them all together.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   I think that coming back and using muscle soreness
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.600]   as a guideline for that is one of the only tools we have
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.260]   in terms of the local level.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.900]   You know, we don't really have, you know,
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.600]   being able to measure, let's say a CPK levels
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.540]   inside of a muscle would be amazing, you know,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:16.120]   at a local level to see how recovered that muscle is.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.600]   But that becomes fairly invasive,
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.040]   at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.000]   So what are our tools?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.880]   I mean, I think that at the basic level,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.260]   that's the one that most people can relate to
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.760]   and easily identify and then use that as a guideline.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.980]   And if you're training when you're really sore,
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.260]   it's probably not a great idea.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.660]   And it's probably a good indication
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.040]   that that muscle is not recovered,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.260]   but at least hearing what you and I are saying here
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.600]   might be a comfort to the person to say,
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.040]   yeah, it is possible that it's not recovered.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.400]   Just because 48 hours is the recommendation
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.020]   and just because research points to muscle protein synthesis
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.980]   needing a restimulation, well, maybe not.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.880]   Maybe you're not necessarily there yet.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.400]   You're in that, and for that muscle, you're not there yet.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.620]   So it's all really interesting stuff.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.080]   But as far as the systemic, you know, recovery,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.280]   I think there's a lot of ways, you know,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.860]   people talk about resting heart rate
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.880]   measured in the morning, all different kinds of,
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.140]   you know, core temperature and things like that
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.420]   that might become altered in a state of non-recovery,
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.260]   but grip strength is very, very much tied
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.140]   to performance and recovery.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.520]   And when I was at the Mets,
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.180]   we used to actually take grip strength measurements
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.300]   as a baseline in spring training all the time.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.620]   Now, obviously as a baseball player,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.960]   you're gripping a bat, you're a pitcher,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.300]   you're gripping a ball, like, you know,
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.820]   having good grip strength is important.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.000]   So if we've noticed somebody had a very weak grip,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.440]   it's just a good focal point
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.740]   of a specialized training component for the program.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.040]   - Do you do this every day with those guys?
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.540]   - No, we would do, in spring training,
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.260]   we do sort of a baseline entry level measurement,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.220]   and then we would measure it throughout the season,
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.140]   maybe once every two weeks or three weeks.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:50.040]   And, you know, the idea there was to manage the recovery,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.380]   measure the recovery, but I just gave it away.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.060]   You know, to determine overall recovery,
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.080]   your grip strength is pretty highly correlated.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.980]   So we have found that with one of those scales,
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.700]   those old fashioned bathroom scales
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.860]   at like Bed Bath and Beyond or whatever you can get,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.780]   which by the way, almost impossible.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.840]   I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.200]   to put in that video, and we almost couldn't find one
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.300]   'cause everything is like digital and everything,
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.140]   you know, it's like this,
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.480]   I'm looking at the old fashioned dial controls.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.120]   - It's like old Macintosh computers.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.020]   There's a huge market for them.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.800]   And old phones, kids, keep your phones now.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.320]   In 30 years, the lame phone now will be worth a lot of money.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.160]   - Will be worth a lot.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.180]   So, you know, I wound up, you know, finding one,
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:37.060]   and it's a great tool for just squeezing the scale
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.100]   with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.540]   And I think we all can relate to this
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.940]   when you just visualize, imagine the last time you were sick
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.580]   or just try this the next time you wake up in the morning.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.900]   When you first wake up in the morning, you're still groggy.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.140]   Try to squeeze your hand.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.940]   Try to make a fist as hard as you can.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.780]   You're gonna sit there angry at your fist
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.660]   because it won't contract as hard as you know it can.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.340]   You don't have the ability to just create the output.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.540]   And that is because in that state, you're still sleepy.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.620]   You're still fatigued.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.180]   You know, you're not even awake at the, you know,
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.860]   the whole level at this point.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   Well, that is still an actual phenomenon that happens
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.320]   that, you know, a lack of recovery or a lack of wakefulness
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.980]   or whatever you wanna say is gonna lead
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.460]   to a decreased output there.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.260]   So when you start to measure that on a daily basis,
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.820]   you can get a pretty good sense of where you're at.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.340]   And I think when people start to see a drop off of 10% or so
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.220]   or even greater of their grip output,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.220]   you really should skip the gym that day
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.400]   because I don't think there's much you're gonna do there
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.340]   that's going to be that beneficial,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.860]   even if it is the day to train legs or whatever day it is.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.140]   - I love this tool.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:48.980]   It's simple.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.260]   It's low cost if you can find such a scale.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.740]   I guess you could also find one of those grippers that,
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.340]   and you can do this in a very non quantitative way,
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.620]   but better would be a scale
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.940]   where you could actually measure
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.740]   how hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time of day.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.100]   It draws to mind just a little neuroscience factoid
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.520]   in the world of circadian neurobiology.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.660]   One of the consistent findings
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.040]   is that in the middle of your nighttime,
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.900]   you know, they'll wake people up
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.820]   and they'll say, do this test.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.960]   In the laboratory, they use a different apparatus,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.620]   but it's essentially the same thing.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.460]   And in the middle of the night,
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.860]   grip strength is very, very low.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.260]   And you know, mid morning, grip strength is high.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.700]   And as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.100]   grip strength goes higher and higher and higher,
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:27.940]   and then it drops off.
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.900]   There's a circadian rhythm and grip temperature.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.820]   So you probably want to do this
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.060]   at more or less the same time each day,
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.900]   if you're going to use it.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.840]   But I think it's brilliant and in its simplicity
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.060]   and its directness to these upper motor neurons,
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.540]   'cause that's really what it's assessing.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540]   Your ability, again,
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.660]   it's about the ability to contract the muscles hard.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.500]   If you can't do that,
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   you're not going to get an effective workout.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.780]   - Yeah, and they also, I mean,
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.900]   there certainly are more sophisticated tools too,
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.660]   as a PT, you know, we have hand grip dynamometers,
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.660]   you know, and we can measure one side at a time too.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.620]   You know, I'm not really, I'm getting a little bit blinded
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.820]   by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.020]   and I don't get really a left-right comparison.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:03.920]   But even at that level,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.220]   that could give you a little bit more detail,
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.140]   but that comes at a cost.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.580]   So they're pretty expensive devices.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.740]   But if it's, listen, if you were an athlete,
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.200]   you know, the 200, 300 bucks it costs to have one of those
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.020]   would be well worth, you know, the added investment, you know.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.960]   - And I'm sure some of our listeners will want one too,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.900]   'cause there are a lot of tech geeks out there.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.320]   Not tech industry geeks, but people who like tech gear.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   What's it called again?
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.880]   - It's a hand grip dynamometer.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.040]   - Hand grip dynamometer.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.260]   Said by Jeff with a great East Coast accent
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.660]   and by me in a terrible botched at a West Coast version.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.500]   Thank you.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.540]   We'll put that in the show notes also.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.680]   No, I think recovery is key.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.980]   We always hear about sleep.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.480]   You grow when you sleep and incidentally, your brain,
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.260]   you stimulate learning when you're awake, obviously,
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.220]   but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.640]   This is why sleep is the way to get smarter,
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.560]   provided you're also doing the learning part.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.720]   This leaves the way to get stronger,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.540]   provided you're also doing the training part.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.780]   You've had some really,
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.740]   you've put out interesting content over the years
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.140]   in terms of even sleep position.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.340]   One of the major changes that I made to my sleep behavior
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.680]   is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the bed.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.520]   And I'll tell you,
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.100]   this had a profound impact on several things.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:14.940]   First of all,
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.600]   my feet have always been the bane of my existence.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.940]   Broke them a bunch skateboarding.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.380]   And I noticed when I'd run, I'd get shin splints.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.820]   And then I started to notice that my feet sort of,
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.480]   you're the PT, they were kind of floppy
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.380]   and as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.600]   at rest if I was.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.500]   And I realized that based on listening to you previously,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.060]   that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:37.900]   - Right, right.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.660]   - I don't know what the thing in the hotels.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.620]   And I started releasing the sheets at the end of the bed.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.460]   And I also started doing some tibialis work,
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.620]   front shins work, essentially.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.880]   Changed everything.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.440]   My back pain from running.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.840]   My shin splints disappeared.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.860]   My posture improved.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:55.340]   Although my audience will tell me
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.340]   that it still needs improvement.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.840]   There are always five or 10 people that want.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.680]   - Sit up straight.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.540]   - I've actually had chairs sent our mailing address.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.780]   Very nice chairs.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.440]   So I'm trying there.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.960]   But this is fascinating, right?
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.720]   The position that one sleeps in.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.080]   I fortunately have never had any shoulder issues,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.000]   knock on wood.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.320]   But maybe you could just talk to us a little bit
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.840]   about sleep and sleep position
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.180]   for sake of waking position and movement.
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.120]   Because this, I think, is a very unique
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.060]   and very powerful way to think about sleep.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.100]   This podcast has done a lot of episodes
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.660]   about keeping the room cool,
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.940]   getting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.580]   How to get into sleep.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.440]   But you've talked about, physically,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.500]   what positions might be better to sleep in.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.180]   So please enrich us.
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.000]   - Yeah, I mean, first of all,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.060]   some people's opinions of that type of content
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.520]   is that you sleep in the position that's most comfortable.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.240]   So you ensure that you're sleeping.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.120]   Oh, great.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.140]   I understand that.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.080]   We all want to sleep.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.460]   That's the goal when we put our head on the pillow
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.140]   is to actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.920]   and not know what the hell happened unless you had a dream.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.040]   But beyond that,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.680]   there are certainly physical components to sleep that.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.120]   That is why a lot of times people will wake up and say,
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.720]   like, you can incur pretty serious injuries in sleep.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.640]   People will wake up and have like a shoulder
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.300]   that did not bother them at all,
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.760]   be humming the next day or even for weeks after,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.000]   because of the one sleep position they put themselves in
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.560]   in a prolonged way.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.800]   And they happen to have a deep sleep
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.440]   even through the discomfort.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.820]   That can do actually some damage.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.720]   So it's understandable that the body can incur
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   some strain and stress if you're sleeping in the wrong way.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.920]   One of the things I say right off the bat is,
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.960]   sleeping on your stomach
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.560]   doesn't really have many benefits.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.240]   You're putting yourself into a position
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   that is depending upon the orientation of your mattress
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.440]   or how many pillows you're using,
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.880]   but you're basically putting yourselves
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.680]   into excessive extension of the lumbar spine,
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.720]   which for most people isn't very good.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.000]   If you're a disc patient,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.320]   I guess that might be helpful for relocating the disc.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.280]   But I mean, for the most part,
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.520]   your hands are then usually not at your sides,
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.880]   but they're up under your arms.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.900]   So you've got them into sort of internal rotation
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.480]   up over elevation in your head.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.160]   It's just not a great position.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   You also have to crank your neck for one side or the other
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.080]   in order to breathe,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.480]   or you're going to be your face down straight into the pillow.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.680]   So I would skip that one.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.480]   And there's some people that are total belly sleepers.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.000]   And I would just say, listen,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.040]   I don't think that is the most healthful,
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.520]   long-term way for you to sleep.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.980]   Try to adopt a different position.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.800]   Sleeping on your side oftentimes
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.320]   is also brought along with that.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.900]   The legs, knees coming up towards the chest,
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.040]   prolonged hip flexion.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.080]   Listen, we're doing enough of that during the day.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.440]   - That's what we're doing right now.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.800]   - We don't need to do another 10 hours or eight hours
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.520]   or something at night like that.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.000]   And it just is reinforcing.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.520]   And as we said too, let's say you trained that day.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.560]   You're just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.320]   Where the body is healing and trying to create
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.660]   some changes in your body.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.440]   One of the reasons why I recommend stretching
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.520]   or static stretching prior to going to bed.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.360]   A lot of people don't really want to do it at that point
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.640]   'cause it could take 10 minutes, five, 10 minutes,
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.240]   depending upon how many muscles you have to stretch.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.220]   But it's good to sort of try to establish
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.520]   just longer length temporarily prior to going into a state
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.420]   where you're going to be not moving and recovering
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:22.520]   and creating new changes in the muscles.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:27.520]   So that kind of, I don't say it doesn't rule out
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.640]   the side sleeper.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.360]   The side sleeper could be very, very helpful
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.000]   for somebody that has apnea or other conditions.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.720]   So again, it's not an all or nothing approach,
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.420]   but it's something that you need to pay attention to.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:43.140]   When you are on your back, like you were talking about,
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:47.420]   and your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.260]   at the end of the bed.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.600]   And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up,
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.620]   don't prefer our beds to have really loose sheets
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.460]   at the end of the bed.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.620]   - It's hard to make the bed in the morning.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.680]   - Right, so it's like you're going to want to have
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.520]   them tight.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.700]   Well, I'm saying, as you experienced,
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.700]   you're going to have this prolonged plantar flexion
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.140]   that's going to likely lead to shorter calves over time
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.820]   because you're lacking all that length
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.940]   for that long period of time that you could have
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.700]   if you just loosened up the sheets
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.120]   and allowed your feet to just hang out where they are.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.260]   Now the resting position of the ankle
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.340]   is not in dorsiflexion.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.020]   It's going to be still in some plantar flexion,
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.160]   but not being driven down and pulled down
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.980]   into that position.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.420]   And I think what happens actually is people
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.660]   who get uncomfortable that way, even in their sleep,
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.300]   will shift away from that by turning either onto their side
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.140]   of their stomach.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:41.100]   So there's definitely an impact of the body position
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.580]   in sleep and figuring out the best way
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:46.580]   that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.300]   but have a mindful eye towards what it's doing to your body
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:53.420]   and choose the one that's least abrasive to your body
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.060]   is the way you should go.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.100]   - Terrific, and again, it's really helped me.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:01.780]   And I'm a big believer based on good science
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.060]   out of Stanford and elsewhere that as much
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.780]   as we can be nasal breathers in sleep,
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.620]   we probably should be.
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.840]   I don't know if you've done any content yet
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.360]   about taping the mouth shut with some medical tape,
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.300]   but the benefits of nasal breathing and sleep
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.140]   are pretty tremendous,
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.060]   but it takes a little bit of training for people to do.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.280]   And the training is very simple.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.020]   It's a little piece of medical tape.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.100]   So again, a topic for another time.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.340]   I'm glad you mentioned stretching.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.900]   I was going to ask about stretching a little bit later,
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.220]   but let's talk about stretching.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.440]   When's the best time to stretch for particular
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.340]   types of results?
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.980]   And maybe you could define some of the different types
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.060]   of stretching.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.820]   So you just mentioned a little bit of,
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.460]   would you call it light stretching or, okay,
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.820]   I'm completely naive here on stretching.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.300]   So let me just say, I can think of stretching
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:49.560]   where I hold the stretch and really try and lengthen,
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.620]   in air quotes, folks.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.300]   I don't want the PTs jumping all over.
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.780]   I don't know what it is, but nutrition and the PTs online
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.220]   are really, they've got pitchforks in both hands.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.820]   - That's a recent evolution, I think, for sure.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.820]   And not the nutrition as much,
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.980]   but the PTs have become a little bit angry these days.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.820]   - I see.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.620]   Well, I always say with feelings of powerlessness
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.340]   comes aggression.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.520]   Remember that, folks.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   So in any case, they're stretching where I'm,
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:18.340]   you know, trying to consciously lengthen,
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.160]   again, in air quotes, the muscle.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.300]   I'm not yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.940]   Maybe you could define the different types of stretching
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.340]   for people, maybe give us some rough guidelines
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.980]   about whether or not to do it cold or warm,
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.100]   before training, after training, et cetera.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.860]   - So yeah, there's obviously,
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.420]   there's a lot of different types of stretching.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.860]   They could get even to, you know, PNF stretching
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.980]   and things that are a little bit more, you know, niche.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.860]   But like in general, the two basic forms of stretching
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.900]   are active stretching and passive stretching.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.440]   And your, you know, your dynamic work
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.780]   and your passive stretching is done with the goal
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:56.740]   of trying to create an increase in the flexibility
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.580]   of the muscle.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.340]   So whether you're actually increasing the length
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.100]   of that muscle, you know, more so what you're doing
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.000]   is increasing the resistance or decreasing the resistance
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.220]   of that muscle to want to stay
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.900]   at a certain level of flexibility.
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.620]   So when we can sort of take the brakes off
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:14.360]   and allow that muscle to allow us more range of motion,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.260]   we're inherently increasing flexibility
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.680]   without necessarily having to increase
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.020]   the length of that muscle.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.860]   That is usually done at a time far away from your workout
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.740]   because they have shown where this type of stretching
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.700]   done prior to an activity.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.700]   And it could be like a structured activity,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.700]   like lifting, or it could be a little bit less structured,
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.340]   like competing in a sport in a spontaneous type way.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:44.340]   That there is a period of recalibration that is needed
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.740]   after doing this because you're disrupting
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   the length tension relationship of the muscle
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.500]   that causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these,
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.420]   I've talked about before, stored motor engrams in your mind
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.060]   in terms of this is the pattern
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.260]   for how I swing a golf club, say, you know?
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:03.860]   And now introducing a little bit of flexibility
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.380]   or added flexibility or range
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.380]   because of the stretching I did before,
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:12.060]   it takes maybe a whole or two or three to match up again.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.800]   Oh, this is what he's trying to do,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.860]   that golf swing thing that I remembered again.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.300]   Like it's not remembering that every component
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.180]   like I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.300]   and then I have to bend my elbow and I have to break.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.220]   Like your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.540]   So, and when I have to start matching up that stored pattern
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.660]   with what's feeling new because of the increased range,
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.820]   I can impair performance.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.220]   And again, it could happen even in a gym workout
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.780]   where you're talking about your first, second set,
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:41.260]   third set, where maybe the repercussions aren't as big
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.120]   'cause I'll just do a few extra sets.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.500]   But in performance, if you screw up
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.220]   your first three rounds, you're playing on a PGA tour
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.140]   and you shoot, you know, you're six over after three,
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.740]   you're done, you know?
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.840]   So I think it matters there.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.660]   As far as the dynamic, you know, so we relegate that,
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.060]   as I mentioned, sort of towards the end of the day,
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.280]   when it's not going to impact performance,
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.820]   but even maybe have the additional benefit
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.540]   of creating the feeling of length
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.020]   or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.380]   at a time when I know my body is going to try to tend to heal
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.900]   and heal shorter, never longer, but heal shorter.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.820]   So if I can introduce a little bit of that extra length
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.060]   or decreased resistance to that length,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.220]   it's a better time to do it.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:25.180]   So I think it promotes a better recovery.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.220]   If I want to-
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.060]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.220]   So stretching later in the day,
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.040]   because I'm intrigued by this concept of heal shorter.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.820]   So part of the healing and recovery process
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.980]   means a shortening of the muscles.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.900]   This is the tensing up in sleep.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.340]   Could you elaborate just a bit on that
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.420]   and then sorry to break your flow, but then to continue?
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.540]   - Yeah, no, just basically, you know,
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.720]   what's been shown is that when the repair process,
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.360]   muscular repair from let's say strength training
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.200]   during the day,
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.440]   the repair process usually results in a muscle
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.820]   that is slightly shorter rather than increased in length.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.560]   You know, it's just that it's, you know,
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.920]   muscles prefer to sort of ratchet their way down
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.760]   into that contraction and then, you know,
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.360]   maintain that more comfortable length tension relationship.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.140]   So when you're sleeping, it tends to, you know,
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.080]   err on the side of shorter rather than longer
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.040]   when ideally we don't really want that.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.960]   We want to maintain as much of that length
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.680]   because with more length,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.340]   we actually have more leverage, right?
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.220]   That muscle has more leverage to contract.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.960]   If it was all the way contracted, you know,
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.040]   you really can't obviously, you know,
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.380]   generate much force in a muscle
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.600]   that's already maximally contracted.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.060]   So I think we want to do something that we,
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:33.900]   whatever we can,
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.680]   whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.540]   that could allow us to do this prior to sleep.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.360]   And again, it's just making a conscious choice
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   to do it at a time of the day
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.000]   that makes a little bit more sense.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.760]   Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.760]   of trying to create any type of feeling of act
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.380]   or increasing the potential length,
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.480]   as you said, of the muscle,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.060]   but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.140]   and increasing, you know,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.560]   exploring the ends of that range of motion
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.600]   in a more dynamic way so you're not hanging out there
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600]   and disrupting that length tension relationship
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.820]   but just sort of touching the ends of those barriers
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.360]   so that when you feel movement again,
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.440]   it feels looser, it feels more ready.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.880]   And obviously at the same time, warming up, blood flow,
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.600]   all the benefits we get from just warming up in general.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.620]   So like, you know, that's the series
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.720]   you've probably seen a bunch of times,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.100]   but like, you know, leg swings and, you know,
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.080]   butt kicks and, you know, lunge, walking lunges
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.920]   and all types of drills. - Toe touches.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.840]   - Toe touches, all those kinds of drills,
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.980]   those active stretching drills,
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.000]   or, you know, lunging with rotations of the upper body
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.200]   to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved too.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.100]   Those are the drills that people will do prior to training
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.400]   that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.580]   but also helpful for just the general warmup of the body
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.620]   'cause of the blood flow,
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.440]   but from a muscle readiness standpoint,
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.360]   not impairing the performance while at the same time
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.460]   exploring the increased ranges.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.160]   'Cause as you know, the first toe touch you do
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.800]   is not as high as the last toe touch you do.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.540]   - For me, it doesn't even include the toe.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.380]   (laughing)
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.220]   - Right, the shin touch, the knee touch.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.680]   - Toe touch attempt, right. - Right, right.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.760]   So like, you know, those are going to improve
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.440]   with each subsequent rep.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.920]   And I think that's what people actually,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.380]   like when you can see those actual changes
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.500]   from rep one to rep seven, you just feel ready.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.220]   You feel more alert and ready to go in your workout.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.840]   So the dynamic type of stretching,
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.340]   and I mentioned earlier on, you know,
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.680]   like what I've had to do
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.220]   to sort of increase my warmup focus, you know,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:36.060]   I think that's more of what I try to do these days.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:39.120]   I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that,
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.260]   you know, my body's not ready.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.060]   When I was working with Antonio Brown,
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.900]   I remember like he would spend 20 minutes,
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.300]   30 minutes on all dynamic work.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.620]   And I've never seen anybody spend that long
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.660]   on their dynamic work,
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:55.160]   but like he said, he just didn't feel right and ready to go
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.000]   unless he did a lot of that.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.200]   And I mean, you know, his dynamic stretching routine
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.700]   would be a workout for most everybody, you know,
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.600]   it's crazy how much he did.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.180]   - These pro athletes are amazing.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.960]   And you've had the great fortune of working with
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.200]   and improving their abilities.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.940]   But I can only imagine,
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.660]   'cause I also imagine he's pretty strong in the gym also.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:19.080]   - I mean, you know, and so it always amazes me
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.460]   the guys that make it to that level,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.480]   no matter what sport they do,
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.340]   they're so gifted in everything, you know,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.260]   like David Wright used to make me laugh all the time
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.680]   with the Mets because no matter what I ping pong,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.000]   you know, like anything he,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.460]   because of his hand-eye coordination,
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.100]   like anything, you know, great at.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.780]   Jump rope, I remember he hadn't done a lot of jump rope.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.180]   And I think jump rope was one of the best things
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.900]   you could do from a conditioning standpoint.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.420]   It's actually, it's fairly interesting.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.260]   It's not just, you know,
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.580]   it's not too harsh on the joints,
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.760]   depending on, you know, even though it's a ballistic move.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.400]   And he wasn't, I have to admit, you know,
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.820]   if you listen to this, he's going to want to kill me,
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.420]   but I was better at him than at jump roping,
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.580]   one of the only things I could do.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.860]   And then I gave him about five days
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.660]   and he completely blew me out of the water
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.820]   to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.260]   He made it look effortless.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.140]   It's like, that's where the athlete in someone comes out.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.340]   No matter what they pick up, they're good at it.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.620]   And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym,
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.700]   like their strength levels tend to be pretty damn good
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.540]   and they're in their abilities, their coordination,
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.000]   they're everything just tends to sort of be good
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.380]   at that level, you know, and it sort of amazes me
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.660]   why those guys can go pick up a golf club, you know,
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.960]   and go shoot 72, you know,
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.060]   and having never really played, you know,
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.960]   they're just naturally good at whatever they do.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.820]   - Yeah, I have a couple, I'm smiling
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.500]   'cause I have a couple of really close friends
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.820]   who did a number of years,
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.820]   some several decades in the SEAL teams.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.340]   And I don't know that their skill level at everything
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.560]   is so high as you're describing for athletes,
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.500]   but their level of competitiveness is beyond.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.580]   I ocean swim with one.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.460]   There's no chance that I'm going to, you know,
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.500]   out swim Pat ever, ever.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.000]   He actually goes back and forth sometimes
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.520]   just to check up on me, which I appreciate.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.940]   Thank you, Pat.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.180]   I haven't drowned yet, but in addition to that, you know,
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.780]   we could play horseshoes and it's like this switch
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.360]   that just flips on and like he's going to murder me.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.620]   He's a very nice guy, right?
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.820]   In general, they tend to be very nice,
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.500]   but the level of competitiveness is kind of unreal.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.420]   - They're trying to beat themselves.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.320]   They're not even trying to beat you.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.160]   - That's right.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.320]   I'm not even in the competition.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.160]   - You're not even in the competition.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.000]   You're not even there.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:19.820]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.660]   Thank you.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.920]   Now I won't feel so bad or worse.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.860]   It's true.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:25.680]   It's a remarkable thing.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.700]   I'm glad you mentioned jump roping.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.220]   I used to skip rope for warmup for boxing, you know,
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.340]   and those like three, three minute rounds
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.860]   or something like that.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.960]   But I'm glad you brought it up because skipping rope
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.600]   is something that obviously has a cardiovascular component.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.300]   There's the conditioning component, there's timing,
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.860]   and it is kind of interesting, right?
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.860]   You can, it's frustrating when you don't get it,
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.100]   especially when it whips you on the ear,
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.460]   if you're using a proper rope.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.800]   I'm just curious if you could just give us a quick
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.840]   skipping rope one-on-one.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.780]   Do you like to see people jumping with both feet and toes?
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.660]   We'll link to a video if there was one and I missed it.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.140]   Do you like to see people doing high knees?
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.940]   Do you like people basically like shuffling?
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.200]   You want to see people doing double dutch?
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.480]   What do you want to see people doing over time?
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.220]   - All of the above, maybe not the double dutch,
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.340]   but all of the above.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.560]   I mean, I think that that's the cool thing about it, right?
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.260]   Like once we sort of master the skill,
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.540]   'cause for all of us, that first jump with the two feet
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.180]   going together is a challenge.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.460]   'Cause you just got to time that rope,
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.640]   you got to time your jump.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.260]   And then we get bored as we often do as humans,
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.520]   we get bored with what we can do
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.940]   and want to take on new challenges.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.580]   So then it becomes one leg at a time,
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.480]   or then it becomes side to side hops, right?
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.900]   All of those things are beneficial.
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.620]   I believe neurologically to enhancing the ability
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.920]   to do the skill as a whole,
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.500]   but also just because I'm such a believer
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.980]   in training in all three planes.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.580]   So like just doing straight up and down
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.660]   versus now I can do frontal plane side to side motion.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.760]   And then I can even do small little twists
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.700]   or corkscrews, we call them.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.760]   It requires a different,
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.460]   you would know more about it better than I do,
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.580]   that it requires different neurological patterns
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.000]   to be able to coordinate that
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.820]   because you're changing the orientation
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:00.660]   of your body and space.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.080]   So it's not just that I'm changing the exercise,
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.980]   but I'm changing how my body interprets that exercise
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.900]   because what's happening to my body and space.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.300]   So I love whatever people wind up doing,
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.420]   but I am amazed.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.540]   There are people,
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.780]   I just started following this young woman on Instagram
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.860]   who is like, I'll give her a plug.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.300]   I think it's like Anna Skips or something.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.940]   And she is ridiculous.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.940]   Like I watch her and I'm like mesmerized
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.620]   at what she can do with the rope.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.940]   It's like, it's an extremely athletic endeavor
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.260]   when it gets to be at that level
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.900]   and the speed and the precision
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.180]   and I think one of the goals
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.500]   that you want to be able to have
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   is to where you're feeling
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:45.260]   as if you're almost effortlessly dancing without a rope,
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.760]   like where you're just bouncing off
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.000]   of the ball of your foot.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.020]   And it's an important skill to learn too,
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.500]   whether you go back to run or even jog, right?
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.720]   Just like more casual running,
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.300]   learning how to land is so important.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.660]   One of the drills that people should try
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.260]   is like try to jump on your heels.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.940]   So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, right?
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.580]   And just jump from your heels and land on your heels.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.140]   You'll feel it in your jaw.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.740]   You'll literally feel your jaw rattle
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.860]   when you land on your heels.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.980]   There is no shock absorption capabilities
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.940]   through your heels.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.420]   Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.440]   when they run and your body's not built
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.980]   to absorb the forces like the ball of your foot could.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   It's really built as a spring.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.960]   And the foot is, to me, as a physical therapist,
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.840]   the foot has always been one of the most,
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.080]   you talk about having bad feet.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.360]   I have flat feet.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.000]   It looks like I got flippers if I took my shoes off.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.440]   Like I'm wearing scuba fins.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   There is no adaptability of that foot to the surface.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.180]   When it's completely caved and flattened like that,
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.360]   the job of the foot is to be adaptable.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.240]   Well, maybe there is some adaptability
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.620]   because it's so floppy.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.100]   But at the same time, at some point,
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.640]   that critical juncture when you're gonna then step through
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.520]   and you need to be able to push off,
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.660]   the foot has to actually change this in the mid-foot itself
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.340]   to become a rigid lever, as they call it.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:11.580]   You're going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.760]   That rigid lever literally locks up the mid-tarsal joint
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.060]   to become solid so that you can push off of it
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:18.960]   with leverage.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.980]   If you lack that capability,
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.660]   all those stresses that are supposed to be borne by the foot
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.820]   go up into the ankle, into the knee, into the hip,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.020]   into the low back.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:32.020]   So learning how to land and start to train your body
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.060]   to experience ground reaction forces the right way
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.340]   is so critical to all other function
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.140]   and all their disability up the kinetic chain.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.360]   And jumping rope is like one of the best ways
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.420]   to learn how to do that.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.560]   - Great, I own a jump rope.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.380]   I love doing it in the morning
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.820]   while I get sunlight in my eyes.
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.660]   It's actually a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferriss,
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.420]   who mentioned, 'cause listeners of my podcast know
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.140]   I'm like a broken record with get sunlight in your eyes,
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.180]   even through cloud cover.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.900]   It just sets your sleep rhythms and your waking rhythms,
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.440]   the yada, yada, on and on.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.300]   But sometimes they'd be kind of boring for people
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.480]   and I want to get them off their phone.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.740]   So jumping rope is also just a great way to wake up.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.540]   So jumping rope can be the cardio workout,
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.300]   the 15 or 30 minutes.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.180]   - Definitely, and there's sort of that hybrid
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.180]   that we were talking about before of like,
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.660]   you're not necessarily dropping down to the ground
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.500]   and doing burpees,
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.060]   but I just look at it as a more athletic endeavor
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.900]   because of the coordination involved
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.140]   than just simply walking or jogging.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.740]   - Yeah, and it's not much of a equipment requirement,
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.060]   very minimal cost.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.380]   You could even use a rope or something if you, although--
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.740]   - We even instruct people that you use no rope
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.660]   and just pretend and just move the arms, right?
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.580]   - Truly zero cost.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.140]   - You're never going to hit the rope, which is good,
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.100]   but at the same time,
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.640]   so you're never going to know if you're doing it wrong,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.540]   but at least you can move through and get the same benefits
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.380]   through the feet.
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.400]   - I love it, I love it.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.000]   I told myself before sitting down with you today
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.580]   that I wasn't going to focus on specific exercises
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.380]   because there's such a wealth of incredible content
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.980]   that you put out there that people could just put
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.360]   into YouTube or elsewhere and arrive at the proper way
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.440]   to do a chin or a dip or for whatever purpose.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.900]   But there's one exercise in one particular motion
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.380]   that I'd like to discuss for a moment
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.820]   because I believe that learning about this cautionary note
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.840]   from you is one of the reasons
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.980]   that I've maintained steady training for 30 years
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:33.060]   with no major injury, knock on wood,
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.640]   and that's the upright row.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.060]   One thing that, whether or not people weight train or not--
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.360]   - We censor this podcast?
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.100]   Are we censoring to be beeped this out or no?
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.460]   - Oh, do you get beef about this?
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.320]   - You know what, we always get beef
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.720]   in any social media platform we're ever put out,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.840]   but no, I get some from it,
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.740]   but I'm fully prepared to defend myself.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.420]   - But here's the reason for asking about this.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.780]   I never really cared much for upright rows.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.300]   It's not an exercise I tend to do,
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.320]   but one thing that's apparent in all my colleagues
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.640]   and every child I see and every adult I see
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.580]   is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.060]   So folks, I think I learned this from you all.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.080]   So if you stand up straight
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.140]   and then you just point your thumbs out like a thumbs up,
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.540]   but you're just pointing, your hands are down,
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.300]   you're pointing your thumbs straight out,
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.080]   ideally they would go straight out.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.460]   Most people, the thumbs are gonna be pointing
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.300]   toward one another,
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.880]   because most people are starting to look somewhere
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   between a non-human primate and a melted candle.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:38.640]   Bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.880]   We're all sitting, we're in inward rotation,
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.940]   but I learned from you that the upright row compromises
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.140]   some important aspects of our shoulder mechanics
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.260]   and can be actually sort of a dangerous movement
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.100]   in some ways.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.000]   I'm sure there's a safe way for people to do it,
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.740]   but so I've always made it a point now
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.740]   on the basis of this advice to A, not do upright rows,
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:00.660]   but I wasn't doing them before,
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.260]   but to really strive for external rotation
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.700]   on things like bench dips,
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.320]   on a number of different things.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.780]   Whenever I can, I try and go into external rotation
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.620]   and provide, without looking like an idiot
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.740]   walking around with my palms facing outward.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.240]   Please tell us about internal, external rotation.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.060]   The upright row is one aspect of that,
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.700]   but why this is so important, not just for weight training,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.380]   but as in terms of posture and mechanics
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.700]   and not looking like a melted candle
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.660]   or partially melted candle.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:32.500]   - I actually love it.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.740]   I am happy to talk about it
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:37.340]   'cause I love the shoulder as a joint.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.880]   I think PTs tend to fall in love with certain areas
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.780]   and the shoulder is one of the cool areas for me.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.540]   It's like the foot is, but the shoulder has the most mobility
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.860]   in the body of any joint,
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.500]   but it's also got the least stability, right?
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.100]   There's always that trade off of mobility and stability.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.100]   So your stability comes from certain muscle groups
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.920]   and one of the ones that the only muscle group
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.980]   that actually externally rotates the shoulder
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.660]   is going to be the rotator cuff, okay?
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.160]   And unless you were devoted to training
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.420]   through external rotation
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.980]   and exercises that are going to externally rotate
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.660]   the shoulder, you're not training that function.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.020]   And it's so easy for us in everyday life,
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.600]   especially those that aren't training
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.460]   to not ever really undergo any of those stresses
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.560]   that could be beneficial to counteracting
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.820]   what happens freely and naturally,
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.100]   which is internal rotation.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.040]   So when you think about the imbalance created just by nature
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.460]   and how we live our lives,
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:35.820]   internal rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.620]   So you need to address it.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.020]   And the reason why you need to address it
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.700]   is because you need to normalize those biomechanics
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.740]   to the shoulder if you want their long-term health.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.460]   And one of the functions of the shoulder
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.380]   is to raise our arm up over our head.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.900]   And if we do that from an internally rotated position,
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.620]   we're going to have a higher likelihood
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.780]   of creating stress inside that joint.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.580]   Funny thing is, I talked about before my PT brethren
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.660]   can be somewhat angry these days.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.620]   I don't know what happened, but fairly angry.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.760]   You know, they wanna discredit the existence
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.040]   of something like a shoulder impingement,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.840]   which I don't know how, I mean, certain studies,
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.620]   look at both, we all read studies
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:17.000]   and studies will say one thing one day
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.760]   and potentially conflict entirely in a different direction.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.560]   Some studies will point to the non-existence
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:24.080]   of a shoulder impingement.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.640]   Meanwhile, we have thankfully digital motion X-rays
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.520]   that will literally show the impingement occur
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.680]   in real time, in real function.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.720]   And that's one of the limitations,
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.600]   I'm off on a tangent here,
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.160]   but like those types of X-rays
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.360]   or that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays,
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.840]   like gives us such insight that we never had before,
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.320]   'cause we're taking static X-rays
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.880]   of someone laying down on a table.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.160]   You know, when I wanna see what happens
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.860]   when he actually raised my arm up over my head in function,
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.340]   and the tools now exist to do that.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.520]   We see the problems occurring
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.840]   because in order to get normal mechanics
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.260]   and free up the joint maximally inside,
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.480]   you need to externally rotate as you raise the arm up.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.560]   So if your muscles aren't firing
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.800]   and they're not necessarily as strong
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in,
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.700]   you're asking for trouble every time you do that.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.560]   Well, this exercise is literally putting you
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.440]   in elevation and internal rotation.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.600]   And if you were to walk into a PT office
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.600]   and someone said, I think he's got impingement,
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.520]   will you diagnose him?
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.440]   There's a test called a Hawkins Kennedy test.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.240]   And I would put you in the position,
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.720]   I know we're not visible at this point through the podcast,
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.640]   but I'll put you in this position here
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.400]   where I have your arm elevated
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.880]   and your hand pretty much under your chin,
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.160]   pushing downward on that
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.960]   to create that internal shoulder rotation.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.760]   Pretty much the exact position that we're in
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.600]   when we're holding a bar in an upright row.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.420]   Some will say, well, just don't go so high,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.940]   go only up to the level of the chest,
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.160]   but you're still in this internally rotated position.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.880]   The thing that I think frustrates me the most
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.280]   about the exercise is that I have an alternative.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.820]   And the alternative does the same thing
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.880]   in terms of helping the muscles grow
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.240]   by simply fixing the biomechanics of the exercise,
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.740]   but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.080]   So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand,
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   which drives you into internal rotation,
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.160]   if the elbow is lower than the hand,
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.280]   the hand being higher here, I'm in external rotation.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.580]   And I could do something called a high pull
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.280]   and still get the same abduction of the arm
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.420]   and still get the same benefits of the shoulders,
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.680]   the delts and the traps
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.680]   without having to undergo any of the stresses
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.320]   that would come from the somewhat awkward movement
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.680]   of an upright row.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.040]   - And for those listening,
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.480]   we'll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like,
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.020]   but basically what Jeff is doing,
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.500]   and tell me if I'm describing this
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.720]   incorrectly or correctly, Jeff,
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.660]   is taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.380]   So elbows up kind of near the chin
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.300]   and pointing behind you, like, go ahead it that way.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.720]   Like somebody directing the airplane,
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.800]   like come back, come back, come back.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.760]   I forget what they call that.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.560]   I think it's called semaphorin,
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.000]   is the action of like where they direct the planes
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.580]   or something, the flags or whatever.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.840]   Someone will of course tell me I'm wrong about that too,
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.340]   which is why I say these things,
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.820]   because I like being told what the correct answer is.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.640]   In any case, so this replaces the upright row
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.180]   and probably does a number of other important things as well.
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.380]   - Yeah, well, again, listen,
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.500]   without naming names or programs or anything like that,
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:16.180]   when I got involved in Athlean-X,
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.100]   when I first started my online presence,
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.300]   there was a very, very, very popular program
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:25.320]   that was out there that I just for fun,
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.280]   I wanted to, as a PT, this is the nerdy things we do,
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.740]   but I wanted to evaluate the workout structure.
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.920]   And I went and I looked at every rep
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.360]   over the course of a week.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.720]   And there were something like 890 repetitions
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.760]   or something done.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.640]   And zero of them were dedicated
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.240]   to external rotation of the shoulder.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.080]   So if you think about it,
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.760]   I mean, yeah, it was a very popular program
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.980]   that was done by a lot of people.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:51.240]   There was no focus at all,
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.240]   no dedicated focus towards creating a balance to an action
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.720]   that is so predominant.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.160]   And remember, it's not just because we sit with that posture,
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.980]   but the fact that our chest can internally rotate,
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:06.760]   our lats can internally rotate.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.360]   There's like muscle, other big muscles that participate
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.960]   in things that we do every day
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.680]   that will further internally rotate the shoulder.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.740]   The only weapons we have for external rotation
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.720]   are those little rotator cuff muscles,
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.100]   and three of them actually, three of the four.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.680]   And the job is to sort of actively
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.280]   and consciously train them
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.180]   through really the boring exercises, right?
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.560]   Like you've seen them with the band,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.960]   you anchor a band to a pole,
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.140]   you stand with the band in the opposite hand.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.100]   So if it's anchored to the pole on my left side,
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.640]   I've got the band on my right side,
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.680]   and you see people where they kind of rotate their hand
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.640]   towards the back.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.860]   Again, kind of what you were saying,
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.720]   but at a lower elevation,
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.840]   taking the back of my hand
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.800]   and trying to point it to somebody behind me.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.080]   Well, that is one of the ways to train the muscle.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.000]   It's just a one function of the shoulder,
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.600]   external rotation of the shoulder,
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.480]   and you need to do it.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.440]   And again, it's not that if somebody
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.140]   was doing more external rotation work,
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:04.220]   could they absorb the upright row better?
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.000]   Probably, because as they elevated the arm,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.800]   they probably have a little bit more of a contribution
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.780]   from the rotator cuff to one of the functions
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.860]   is to centralize the head of the humerus
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:18.640]   inside of the glenoid, the capsule.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.960]   So as it rises up,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.280]   it stays central as opposed to migrating up
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.520]   because the deltoid likes to pull up.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.440]   So if the rotator cuff has some ability
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.180]   to counteract the upward pull of the delt,
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.640]   then it can maintain a more healthy relationship
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.680]   with overhead movement.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:38.580]   So just realizing that functions only gain
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.080]   through doing these exercises,
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.800]   we would probably dedicate more time there,
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.800]   but the upright row might be better absorbed by that person
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.400]   because they have a little bit more strength.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.040]   But again, why?
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.800]   Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.600]   for what you're trying to do muscularly
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.720]   to build the muscles that it affects,
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.660]   why wouldn't you just do it where you can still see,
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.280]   actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation?
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.320]   You know, so you're getting none of the harm,
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.400]   all of the benefits.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.520]   I see zero reason to ever do the upright row.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.080]   And people will argue, this is the way they argue that,
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.920]   I've done this for 30 years and I've never hurt myself.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   And I always say, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.960]   Like, hey listen, the goal is to not hurt yourself ever.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.600]   So even if you, it's sort of like, you know,
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.720]   the championship game, you know,
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.300]   you might play the game of your life,
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.640]   but if you lose, you lost.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.760]   And when you get into the end of the record books,
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.700]   you're still lost.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.180]   So even if you had the game of your life, you lost.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.040]   I don't care if you do it for 30 years, no pain,
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.940]   you're still doing it and there's no pain.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.120]   I'm giving you an option that's going to give you
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.720]   the same results in the exercise that you're seeking.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.420]   That's why you're doing the exercise
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.020]   without the possibility of having the, you know,
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.740]   the bad outcome come from it.
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:50.860]   So, you know, I get a little bit, you know,
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.300]   defensive of the move, but I feel like it's like,
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.580]   why would you do that, you know?
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:55.580]   - No, it makes sense.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.260]   Being able to train for a long period of time
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:01.260]   and feel good, you know, I'm proud to say, you know,
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:02.900]   and I don't have the kind of genetics where like,
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:04.940]   we don't have a lot of impressive athletes
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.220]   in our family tree or anything.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.900]   There are, you know, some fit individuals,
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.940]   some less fit individuals, but I really believe
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.000]   it's about putting in the work consistently over time.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.460]   And the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:21.020]   And so, you know, I think that being in external rotation
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.140]   as often as possible is good.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:25.560]   This is actually a good friend who's a yoga teacher told me,
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.640]   this is also a problem with the yogis, you know,
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.840]   all the downward dog stuff.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.640]   For those listening, you can think of inward rotation
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.360]   as like thumbs down, just like thumbs down.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.820]   Inward rotation isn't bad, but less thumbs down,
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.480]   more thumbs up is external rotation.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.440]   So for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.240]   The more exercise you can do in external rotation,
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.400]   the better it seems on average.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.260]   I'd love to chat with you just a little bit more
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.520]   about biomechanics.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.720]   And this is a personal thing that, again,
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.500]   your content really helped solve for me.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.980]   One is, I thought I had lower back pain.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.460]   Thought I had sciatica.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:07.620]   So badly that on a few trips, I worked trips years ago
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.820]   when I was doing a lot more international travel.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.560]   I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.040]   I mean, like excruciating pain.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.280]   I didn't want to take medication.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.720]   I didn't want to do back surgery.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.700]   In the end, it turns out it wasn't a back injury at all.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.680]   And one of the things that helped fix it was this,
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.280]   just learning about this thing called the medial glute.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.480]   And you had a video that said fixed back pain,
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.340]   and then you quite accurately say that some back pain
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.200]   isn't really about the back at all.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.480]   And it had me do an exercise or allowed me to try
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.680]   an exercise where I lay on my side
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:45.000]   and essentially pointing my toe down, top toe down,
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.440]   almost like pointing a toe down,
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.040]   and then would slowly lift the leg up
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.940]   while pointing the toe down.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.600]   Maybe I got it incorrect here.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.680]   And then holding that, and there's a muscle
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.200]   that sort of sits at the top of the glute.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.960]   It kind of peeks out every once in a while.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.560]   You can feel it there with your thumb,
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.860]   which is I think that you had pushed back on it a bit,
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.980]   creating that mind muscle link again.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.600]   And there with proprioception,
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.680]   the actual feeling of a muscle literally with a limb,
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.700]   we know, based on the neural circuits for movement,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.580]   that that enhances the contractile ability of a muscle.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.200]   So like if you touch your bicep,
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.460]   you literally can contract it more strongly.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.620]   And this makes total sense
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.740]   based on neuromuscular physiology.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.240]   So it had me do that repeatedly.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.640]   And I started doing that in my hotel room,
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.300]   and the pain started to disappear.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.840]   And then it came back again in the afternoon.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.360]   So I did it again in the afternoon.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.600]   So this is something I did for three or four days,
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.440]   and lo and behold, my back pain's gone.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.280]   I handed this off to my father
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.980]   because he, like me, has a slightly lower right shoulder.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.320]   I think our gait is probably thrown off by this.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.280]   It's probably a genetic thing.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.120]   Who knows?
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.080]   He handed off to somebody.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.800]   It turns out that we don't suffer from back pain.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.300]   And in fact, now I don't suffer from remaining pain
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.060]   because I was doing this exercise,
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.960]   which I think is helping my medial glute.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.120]   Two reasons why I raised this.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.600]   One, I know a lot of guys who have right side sciatica
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.320]   'cause people keep the wallet there is one idea,
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.700]   or left side sciatica.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.180]   There are a lot of people, male and female,
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:13.120]   who think they have back pain
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.560]   when they don't actually have back pain.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.120]   And the other thing is that,
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.340]   is about a general question about biomechanics
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.760]   or statement about biomechanics.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.740]   I had of a feeling that a lot of what people think
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.800]   is back pain or knee pain or neck pain
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.640]   or headache or shoulder pain
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.080]   is actually the consequence of something that's happening
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.720]   above or below that site of pain.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.840]   And this is a whole landscape of stuff
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.400]   related to PT and recovery and pain management.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.260]   But maybe you just educate us a bit on this
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.640]   and why this works.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.980]   What is the medial glute?
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.680]   Why did it make my so-called back pain disappear?
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.040]   And how should people think about pain?
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.200]   And I'd like to use this as a segue
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.040]   to get into a little bit deeper discussion
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.080]   about pain and recovery.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.920]   - Sure.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.560]   So this is definitely like a big cornucopia PT stuff here,
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.060]   but like, and this is what I love.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.500]   So first of all, that video,
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.440]   that is, it's my proudest video that I have.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.120]   And the reason being is that I,
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.620]   it's helped so many people.
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:14.360]   Like we get comments on that video every day.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.200]   I don't even know how many of you
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.120]   just got now 30 some odd million or it's,
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:17.960]   there's a lot of-
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.800]   - We will link to it.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.880]   - Yeah, there's a lot of views.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.760]   And quite honestly,
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.880]   it was a little bit of an afterthought video
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.560]   in terms of its origin.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.000]   I think that that day, maybe Jesse was having some problems
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.600]   or something like that, a little bit of low back pain.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.980]   And I showed him and it helped right away.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.880]   I was like, well, we can make a video on it.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.160]   'Cause this will help people, not everybody.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.980]   If you have a real disc problem, it's not going to help
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.780]   because you're not changing the structural problem
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.920]   that's there.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.280]   But as you said, a lot of people don't.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.640]   And even disc issues, a lot of them are non-operative.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.220]   So you'd want to try these things first.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.480]   As far as what you sort of experienced,
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.800]   sometimes as that glute medius really tightens down
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.480]   and that's again from poor biomechanics
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.960]   up and down the kinetic chain,
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.480]   it can actually press on the sciatic nerve
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.040]   and give you what they call a pseudo sciatica.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.680]   Where it's not like you're making it up.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.240]   It's not like you're not feeling that pain
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.380]   over that same sciatic distribution,
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.200]   but it's not caused from a disc.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.680]   It's not caused from something mechanical there.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.640]   It's caused by the fact that this glute medius
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.700]   has posturally become a problem for you
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:29.040]   or weak because you don't train it
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.800]   and you need to address it.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.120]   So not unlike any other muscle in the body,
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.180]   there are common trigger points and common areas
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.660]   where the muscle will become tightened
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.760]   or painful or spasm.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.760]   And you can basically apply pressure to these areas
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.520]   to and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.860]   by pushing down through there
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.460]   and then contracting the muscle,
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:56.560]   which is why you go through that action of,
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.040]   I think we call it a toe stabber,
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.160]   but like stabbing down and lifting up
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.440]   and stabbing down and lifting up,
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.040]   taking that glute medius through its function
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.040]   so that it's basically kind of working underneath
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.880]   the downward pressure of the finger.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.480]   And that tends to help you to almost knead out
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:15.640]   what might be that trigger point.
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.060]   And that's why people can see immediate relief there
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.740]   because once the trigger point lets go,
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.300]   it feels like, and that's what the comments are
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.980]   in that video, like my God, I literally, I couldn't walk.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.360]   I've been on my hotel floor.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.280]   I did this and I'm fixed.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.540]   And meanwhile, then it could come back
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:32.760]   because your body is like, well,
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.120]   I like being more like this.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.720]   This is how I've been ingrained to be.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.560]   So it might come back,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.600]   but then when you do another round of it
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.440]   and another round of it,
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.660]   and then finally it starts to say, all right,
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:43.500]   I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.320]   It kind of eases up and you can relieve yourself
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.200]   of those trigger points.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.540]   You could do that up and down the back.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.380]   There's other people that get that
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:53.100]   and that sort of inside their shoulder blade,
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.920]   that same type of cramping in another area.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.100]   But once that takes place,
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.120]   well, then the job that I think people have
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.900]   is like become educated that the glute medius
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.720]   is different than the glute maximus.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.640]   Their functions are different.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.260]   You have to work on not just extending the hip,
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.000]   but also abduction of the hip,
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.360]   external rotation of the hip.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.640]   Same thing as in the shoulder.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:18.960]   And this actually segues nicely
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.280]   into the whole concept you were talking about.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.880]   The body is like a mirror image.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.460]   The hip is like the shoulder, right?
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.100]   The ankle is the wrist.
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.240]   The foot is the hand.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.500]   Like the knee is the elbow.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.560]   They're two hinge joints.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.540]   They function that way.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.900]   Well, with the shoulder,
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.640]   you've got that mobility that comes from
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.160]   having all that freedom of motion,
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.740]   but the stability is lacking.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:39.920]   Well, the same thing with the hip.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.520]   Like you've got mobility,
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.500]   but if you don't fully stabilize it
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.680]   by training all of the muscles of the hip,
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.840]   and if you don't strengthen
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.160]   the external rotation of the hip,
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.380]   then you're gonna have issues.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.100]   It's not biomechanically gonna work the same way.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:59.220]   If you think of the body as a series of bands
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.220]   pulling in different directions
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.600]   at different levels of tension,
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.280]   you're being pulled into one direction or the other
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.960]   just by the balance of tension
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.380]   from one weak area to one dominantly tight area.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.440]   And you need to make sure
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.400]   that you can sort of balance this out
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.860]   in order to eliminate some of the adaptations
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.080]   and compensations that happen.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:25.800]   So what I say when we look at sort of the body as a whole,
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.980]   most often, wherever you're feeling the pain
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.760]   is absolutely not to blame.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.760]   There's not to blame.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.420]   It is somewhere above or below as you hinted at.
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.100]   You're talking about the knee is my favorite example of it.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:41.200]   Whenever you have knee pain, patellar tendonitis,
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.080]   which I have forever.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.280]   I've had bad, bad cases of patellar tendonitis
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.560]   where squatting is very difficult for me.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.560]   It's not the knee.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.600]   The knee is literally a hinge joint that,
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.700]   there's a minor rotation capabilities in the knee,
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.440]   but it's a hinge joint.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.240]   And it's being impacted by the hip and the ankle
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.360]   and in the foot.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.820]   As I said before, how critical the foot is.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.460]   If you thought of the knee being the middle of a train track
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:11.440]   where the femur down your thigh and your shin
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.720]   down below your knee where the train track,
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.820]   what would happen if the foot collapses at the bottom?
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.220]   All of a sudden that train track on the bottom
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.360]   gets torqued just a little bit.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.660]   Well, who's going to feel that the most?
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.800]   The area where it's torquing, which is at the knee.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.260]   So the stresses are going to be felt there.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.760]   Meanwhile, the problem is the foot
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.440]   or the problem is the ankle.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.820]   People that are chronic ankle sprainers
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:35.460]   are almost always going to wind up having back pain
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:37.840]   because the ankle sprain causes weakness
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.720]   and maladaptations in the ankle
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.120]   that then gets connected through the chain.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.060]   Because now once I distort the ankle and the shin,
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.280]   now the knee is trying to maintain
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.560]   its ability to hinge smoothly.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.080]   So it torques on the femur to do that.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.940]   Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.500]   pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is out of whack.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.660]   So it really is fascinating.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.500]   It's one of my favorite things about how the body works
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.520]   is how interconnected it is
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.600]   and how one little thing somewhere
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.560]   causes repercussion somewhere else.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.140]   The easiest way to find out what your problem is
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.040]   is to say, "Okay, I know where my symptom is
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.000]   "but I got to find someone who can help me
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.920]   "find the source somewhere else."
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.460]   Because it is going to be usually either above or below.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:21.640]   Mostly usually below
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.980]   'cause it usually translates up the kinetic chain.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.860]   But usually it's going to be below where the real source is.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.000]   So people with low back pain usually have hip issues,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.840]   weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.260]   It's almost always below.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:38.820]   When you get into really high performance athletics though,
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:40.180]   it almost works the other way.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:43.240]   Like where we have pitchers who can't,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.860]   I mean, I'm always fascinated by guys
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:49.780]   that have Tommy John issues in their elbow pitchers.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:53.020]   If you can't externally rotate the shoulder
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.080]   that we talked about again,
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.500]   the ability to get your shoulder back into external rotation,
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.140]   well, your arm has to get to a certain position
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.980]   for release of the baseball.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.420]   And if it can't get there
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.920]   'cause you can't externally rotate the shoulder to get there
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.880]   then the elbow has to sort of torque more
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.860]   in order to allow the arm to get back further.
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:15.140]   And it will try to take some of that motion
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.500]   from a joint that's not really,
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.920]   again, the hinge joint, really capable of doing that.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.240]   So it starts to stress that medial elbow ligament
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:23.740]   to get a little bit further back
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:25.360]   because the shoulder's not working.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.820]   And that just ultimately places strain on the elbow.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:32.300]   So when you see a guy that has pain that floats around,
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   a pitcher that floats around their arm,
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.880]   all that is is sort of this balance of compensation.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.820]   Once his elbow starts hurting,
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.920]   then he can't get the range from the elbow.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.120]   So he tries to dig a little bit further back
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.220]   into external rotation
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.820]   and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.380]   And then he feels that's inflamed.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.100]   So by the way, during that time period,
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.260]   it takes some of the strain off the elbow
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.540]   so the elbow feels better.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:55.120]   Then he decides, okay, now I got the extra rotation
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.380]   but I'm getting too much of that.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.300]   So now I start straining the elbow again
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.900]   and it keeps going through this cycle.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:03.280]   So your body is very smart
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.740]   and it's gonna compensate every single time.
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.000]   It's gonna find the compensation
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.940]   but there's no guarantee that that compensation
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:11.420]   doesn't leave you with a whole host of other issues.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.400]   - Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.720]   In another lifetime, I would have gone and been a PT,
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.440]   although it sounds like the community among PTs online--
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.500]   - I don't know what, listen, we're good people
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:21.340]   but it's like--
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:22.720]   - Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.200]   can get into pretty intense battles.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.960]   Coming from the academic community,
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.700]   the etiquette is so different online
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.440]   because I would say, I think in person,
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.140]   people would probably behave a bit differently.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.120]   - They shake your hand and say hello.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.520]   - Yeah, they shake your hand and say hello.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.040]   And there's also, look, I'll just be very direct about this.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.580]   There are a lot of people online
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:43.240]   for whom their only content is pointing out
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.560]   the misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.580]   Where it's like the bulk of their identity,
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.580]   which to me is sort of a sad existence
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.840]   but there's always more to gain
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.000]   by thinking about what's possible
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.400]   and what's new and what's good
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.360]   but to each their own demise or win.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.520]   - I mean, questioning what's out there,
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.400]   it's healthy, it's normal, it's great,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.560]   it's actually a sparse conversation.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.080]   But as you said, some people's existence
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.800]   is solely to find things to nag about
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.580]   and not actually with the goal being to advance anything
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.600]   but rather just to, yeah.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.400]   - Yeah, in the world of science,
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.300]   being skeptical but not cynical is encouraged.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.600]   But I would say that the longer
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.220]   that somebody is in a career path,
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.820]   it's certainly in science or medicine
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:31.920]   and they realize how hard it is to do various studies.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.140]   Once they publish a few studies,
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.080]   generally they sort of get a better understanding
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.040]   of how the various things are done.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:43.040]   - In any case, along the lines of pain and pain relief
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.240]   and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body,
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:50.920]   one of the great tools that I picked up from your content,
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.320]   which is benefit, I know a huge number of people is,
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.000]   I think I used to hold weights
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.880]   sometimes in the tips of my fingers
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.360]   as opposed to in the meat of the palm of my hands
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.680]   and I had elbow pain and I always thought that,
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.600]   I felt it most on tricep exercises and pushing exercises
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.880]   and I thought I was doing those exercises wrong.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.200]   Turns out, toward the end of my pull-ups or my bicep work,
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.960]   I was letting the weight or the bar drift
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.680]   into my fingertips and the mere shift
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.280]   to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:22.560]   or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.520]   has completely ameliorated that
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.160]   for reasons that you point out
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.480]   and maybe you could just share with us why that is.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.680]   You have this kind of finger pull exercise.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.040]   Usually when someone says pull my finger,
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.360]   it's like a bad middle school or elementary school joke.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.200]   - Well, this one will say push your finger.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.040]   - Right, right.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.600]   - Yeah, this is fascinating.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.280]   Because it just shows again how intricate the body is
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.720]   and how responsive or over responsive it can be
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.960]   to something so little.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.320]   And what you're talking about is that when you grip a bar,
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.440]   whether it be through a curl or whether it be,
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440]   and this is mostly pulling exercises
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.320]   because the tendency for the bar
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.160]   is gonna be to fall out of your hand,
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.440]   not like with a pushing exercise
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.680]   where you're pushing your hand into the bar,
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.040]   so on a bench press, say.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.820]   That bar can drift just by gravity, doing its thing,
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.460]   or fatigue of the hand grip strength,
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.300]   can start to drift further away
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.900]   towards the distal digits through those last couple knuckles
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.300]   that we have on our hands.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:24.440]   And though our hand can still hold it there,
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.460]   the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads.
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.640]   And that can start at a very, I'm not gonna say light,
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.660]   but it could start at dumbbell weight,
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:38.900]   40 pounds, 30 pounds, even 25 pounds for some,
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:40.920]   depending upon their overall strength levels.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.660]   But then when you start to apply it to something
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:46.260]   like your body weight with a chin up,
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.380]   'cause that's natural for the bar to somewhat
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.840]   kind of float down towards your fingertips.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.260]   And it actually is a little bit easier
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:56.740]   to perform the exercise with that sort of like false grip,
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.100]   little hook grip at the end,
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.800]   because you're not gonna engage the forearms
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.140]   into the exercise, you're not gonna start pulling down.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:05.820]   But at the same time,
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.380]   while it could help you to perform them better
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.220]   by getting the back more activated,
[01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:12.120]   if you have weakness in these muscles,
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.700]   'cause it's not a thing that happens to every,
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.780]   it's not one of those upright row type things
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.160]   where I think this is happening to everybody.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.540]   This is happening to people that have
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:23.540]   these inherent weaknesses in these muscles.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.780]   You or having done enough of the gripping
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.820]   in the fore, in the meat of the hand for long enough,
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.400]   but it starts to put that stress on these muscles
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.900]   that are ill-equipped to do this and to handle this.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:39.420]   And it starts to, particularly on that fourth finger,
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.760]   which is part of the muscle we call the FDS,
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.960]   the flexor digitorum,
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.380]   that is just too much for it to handle.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.780]   And that comes all the way down
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.320]   and meets right at the medial elbow,
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.960]   right on that spot that you can say
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.980]   feels like someone's knifing you right in the middle,
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.120]   in that medial elbow.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.000]   And medial epicondylitis,
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.700]   or they call it golfer's elbow,
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:59.800]   is something that a lot of us deal with in the gym.
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.380]   It's one of the most common inflammatory conditions
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:03.500]   people get from the gym.
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:07.380]   And it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:10.480]   or barbell or hand on a pull-up bar over time.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.580]   So the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.660]   so that what you're doing is you're using
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:19.380]   more leverage from the palm to encapsulate the bar
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:20.740]   or the dumbbell or whatever.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.580]   And you're not putting that pressure
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:25.460]   really distally right on that last digit
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.460]   because that's where that FDS muscle is most strained.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.200]   So you're just almost eliminating that from the equation.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.780]   And it's one of those exercises
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:39.060]   that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.060]   so that maybe it's only capable of handling 30 pounds,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.420]   and then when you're doing a chin up
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.140]   and it goes and it drifts so far that it's,
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:49.620]   now let's say you're a 200-pound guy,
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:52.100]   you've got, let's say, 100 pounds through one arm
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.220]   and 100 pounds, this is simplified math
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.900]   that obviously is offset by other muscles,
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:58.140]   but 100 pounds through one arm, 100 pounds through the other,
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.940]   100 pounds off of a muscle that can handle 30,
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.540]   it's not going to take many repetitions to strain it.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.060]   And you're going to feel that maybe
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:06.420]   by the time that set's over,
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.020]   or certainly by the time that workout's over
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.040]   or the next day you wake up,
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.300]   you've got that notable stabbing pain.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:12.920]   Whenever someone feels that,
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.140]   the best thing would be to determine,
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:18.060]   okay, what exercises was I doing that were pulling
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.060]   and where the bar could have drifted deeper
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:24.300]   or further from the meat of my palm into my fingers
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.340]   and figure out a way to deepen that grip.
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.380]   When that happens, though, the best thing to do
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:30.580]   with most of these inflammatory conditions
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.200]   is not do any of that stuff for a little while.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.340]   Not ever, just for a little while.
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.300]   There's always things that you can do around it.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.980]   I'm not saying ever do I say, like, don't go to the gym
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.840]   or don't find something you can do,
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.220]   but I'm saying that particular exercise
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:47.220]   that you feel the pain on while you're doing it,
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:49.320]   never a smart idea to do that exercise
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.380]   when it's inflamed.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.080]   If you are doing exercise and it hurts,
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.640]   you probably shouldn't do the exercise
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   because another reason for the variability of exercise
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.740]   is there's so many other options that you can do
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:05.500]   that will train similar muscles or even the same motion
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.100]   and not cause that stress.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:11.160]   So, I mean, a cable curl would be much easier to do that on
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.720]   than, let's say, a chin up where you don't have the control
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.980]   over the weight like you do by moving a pin on a stack.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:21.500]   So, I think that is a common thing that people find
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.520]   and the best thing to do is just figure out
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.400]   how deep are you gripping that bar
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.240]   and you're going to find that,
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.220]   "Oh my God, I didn't even realize that,"
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:29.780]   because it was just, even though you might start a set
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.600]   in a good position and then it drifts away as you go.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.500]   - Yeah, I think that's what was happening to me
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:35.940]   and I'm very conscious of this now.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   Again, for me, I haven't had this elbow pain at all.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.140]   So, very fortunate.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:45.060]   So again, a debt of gratitude to you.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.060]   I thought there was some roll in my elbow, basically.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:49.660]   And I thought maybe it was a tennis elbow.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.180]   I don't even play tennis, so there you go.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:57.780]   Other aspects of recovery and variables for recovery.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.540]   I think you and I both put out content
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.780]   about the use of cold and I think we can summarize it
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:04.500]   by saying, yeah, it does seem like cold water immersion
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:07.400]   immediately after hypertrophy or strength workouts
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.720]   might be a problem, but a cold shower
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.660]   is probably not a problem.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.180]   What about heat?
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:15.120]   Do you personally use heat and cold saunas,
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.020]   hot baths, hot compresses?
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:23.020]   And by you, I mean you personally and athletes
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:25.460]   that you coach or people that you coach.
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:28.300]   What are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold?
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:32.580]   - Well, I think it might just be an inherited practice
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:36.980]   from the days of trainers since Babe Ruth.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.140]   But we, in baseball, we used a lot of cold
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:43.460]   following performance just because the idea would be
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.500]   there is some, especially pitchers,
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.340]   there is some inflammation that is abnormal.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.620]   The arm is not really designed to do what they do,
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:53.020]   especially at the speed that they move it
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:53.880]   and everything else.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.980]   So we would use ice as a pretty standard practice
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.820]   after that.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:01.620]   But not a lot of heat, I don't really use a lot of heat.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.940]   And of course, from the recovery or the healing aspect,
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:08.980]   that actually becomes rather a personal preference
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:13.820]   they've found now after let's say the first 12 to 24 hours,
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:15.580]   where you're really trying to control inflammation
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.380]   of what you know might be an injury.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:19.520]   But then it can kind of shift the personal preference
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.800]   because the heat can bring blood to the area also.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.260]   And then the cold has its sort of anti-inflammatory effects.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.340]   So there's a balance between
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:30.980]   which one's working better for you.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.580]   So there's really no standard anymore
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:34.340]   for heat or cold in that way.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:39.340]   But from a standpoint of like post-workout healthy status,
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:42.380]   I haven't used much heat or cold in terms of what we do.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.520]   We cover the topic of the cold showers
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.580]   and to try to dispel the myth of even people saying
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:50.940]   that there's giant testosterone releases
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.920]   and all kinds of stuff that,
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.980]   listen, we hear all kinds of things 'cause people want,
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.100]   like I think the idea of just turning the water cold
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.640]   and being in it for 30 seconds
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.140]   and then all of a sudden magically growing
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:04.100]   three times your size is intriguing for a lot of people.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.980]   And that's why they ask these questions
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:07.460]   'cause they're like, that'd be a hell of a lot easier
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:09.880]   than going to the gym and training hard.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.900]   But I'm always fascinated by some of the stuff
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.340]   that you talked about.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.300]   In fact, we started to talk about some of the stuff
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.140]   in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:22.300]   And that was like, there's some untapped territory there
[01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:24.800]   that I think you're finding out about.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.780]   - Yeah, what would be fun would be
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:28.300]   to bring the cool MIT technology from Stanford.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.580]   This is Craig Heller, my colleague,
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:31.380]   Craig Heller's lab at Stanford.
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:35.140]   He's done really important and amazing work in this area,
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:36.700]   but then it moved on to some other things.
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:38.180]   He's also working on Down syndrome
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.460]   and he works on a number of other really important topics
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.060]   as scientists often do.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.640]   But I have access to this cool MIT technology,
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.320]   no relationship to the company, by the way.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.820]   We'd love to come out to your facility
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:52.100]   and we can do the blind type studies.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.020]   - Like the blue blocker test.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.840]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:59.840]   And see how that goes with somebody as advanced trained
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.500]   as you, that's probably the best thing to do.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.780]   So content for the future.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:07.780]   Yeah, I think heat and cold are kind of staples
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.640]   in the PT world and it does seem like people use them
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.980]   slightly differently, but they are kind of
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:16.580]   the macronutrients of recovery there along with sleep.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:23.060]   I do have a question about precision of record keeping.
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:25.420]   Do you keep a training journal?
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.740]   Do you recommend people keep training journals?
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:31.380]   Are you neurotically fixed to cadence of movement
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:34.420]   and are you looking at the, do you have a buzzer going off
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:35.660]   when it's 90 seconds rest?
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:36.940]   Is it 90 seconds rest?
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:40.260]   I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts
[01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.580]   and they scale with whether or not I'm training heavier
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.540]   with longer rest or whether or not maybe midway
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.580]   through a workout I'll shift over
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.340]   to doing higher repetition, lower rest.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:53.340]   This is kind of my crude way of keeping time,
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.540]   but I'm not, will be just to kind of watch the clock.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:59.820]   But I'm not neurotically fixed to the buzzer
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.380]   nor am I on social media during my workouts,
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:05.020]   which is actually a way to really improve workouts
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.860]   is to just not be on social media.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.500]   - Yeah, I can't claim that I'm not guilty of that.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.040]   Sometimes I am on social media,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.580]   but sometimes I'm trying to post something.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:16.180]   - Well, that's different, it's your profession.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:21.180]   - But I mean, I'm not necessarily chained
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:27.240]   to some sort of protocol in terms of how I do.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.760]   I think by this point, I've been doing this a long time.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.580]   And not only is it something I've done for a long time,
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:33.740]   but it's a passion of mine, something I really enjoy.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:36.700]   So I probably inherently have the ability
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:40.700]   to stick to these guidelines in terms of rest time
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:46.420]   to know what I lifted even six months ago on a lift
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:49.680]   and how it felt without journaling it.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:52.860]   But I recognize the value it has to a lot of people.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.900]   It goes back to that whole, my muscle connection idea
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.060]   that we talked about in the beginning,
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.900]   like there's a lack of awareness
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.620]   for all aspects of training,
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.980]   especially maybe it isn't like your interest level.
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:07.180]   And we're talking you and I from a position of interest,
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:08.020]   like this is what we do.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:10.960]   We enjoy just how our bodies work
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.140]   and understanding how they work.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:14.460]   Some people don't care, they just want the end result.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.400]   But journaling and keeping track of that raises awareness
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.660]   to where like, oh my God, I have been on Instagram
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.980]   for the last seven minutes
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.100]   and I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds.
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:28.540]   Like there is a training effect of that.
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:32.120]   Like if you're training for a metabolic overload,
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.580]   you've blown that opportunity
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:38.220]   because your rest time was very important
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.820]   to that protocol working as it should.
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.100]   If you were training for strength,
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.200]   maybe the extra few minutes doesn't matter so much.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.180]   When you get back on the bar, you might find,
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:48.700]   I mean, you might find that it's a better response
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.260]   for your body to rest even longer
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:53.460]   than you've been told three, four minutes, five minutes.
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.940]   And so that way maybe it helps.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.980]   But I think that anything you can do
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.340]   to increase your awareness of your performance
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:04.380]   and also give yourself some objective goal.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:05.860]   Whenever we have an objective goal,
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.500]   it's a lot easier to actually obtain it.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.540]   When you're just there to get a pump
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:12.740]   and you're just there to lift how you feel that day,
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:15.420]   you have to be incredibly disciplined
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:17.180]   in all other aspects of your workout
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.980]   in order to make that effective.
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.040]   And I've done that too.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.860]   I've actually been able to do that too.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:24.700]   But again, the level of repetitions
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.420]   I've accumulated over the course of my life
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:29.820]   and the amount that I read about this stuff.
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:32.180]   And I think I'm able to get away with that.
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.500]   But I think more often than not,
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.620]   what I'm doing is not journaling,
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.860]   but journaling in my head
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:40.940]   exactly what I think people should be doing.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.980]   And that is getting a specific effect
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:44.300]   from what you're trying to do.
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.980]   It's not so haphazard.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.420]   You want to get a specific effect,
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:49.260]   just like any other experiment that you're doing.
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:50.960]   You're doing an experiment on your own body
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:51.860]   with your own weights,
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.740]   which to me is one of the most empowering things
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:55.580]   someone can ever do.
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:57.360]   When they get bitten by the bug
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:00.400]   for exercising and training,
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.740]   and I like to use the word training rather than exercise
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:03.920]   'cause there's a purpose behind it.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.100]   But when they get bitten by that training bug
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.700]   and they start to see actual changes and results,
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:09.680]   you know how empowering that is?
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.660]   'Cause we can't really control
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.640]   that many things in our life, unfortunately.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.140]   And so there's some things that happen to us
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.580]   that we really wish never happened.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:19.940]   And those are not something that we can do anything about,
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.420]   but this is one thing that we can do our best to.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:24.220]   We can't avoid disease entirely.
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.820]   We can't predict when we're going to die.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.900]   We can't do those things,
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:30.980]   but we can certainly decide to show up into the gym that day
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.700]   and get a workout in or go for a run or do something.
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:36.100]   And by doing that, you're giving yourself, I think,
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:37.980]   a better chance at a higher quality of life.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:41.020]   So anything you can do to increase your awareness of it
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:42.560]   and keep you on track with that
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.860]   is like I'm endorsing fully.
[01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:45.980]   - Couldn't agree more.
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:47.740]   I could not agree more.
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:50.780]   The, there is a topic, it's sort of a dreaded topic,
[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:51.860]   but I think it's an important one
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:54.100]   and that's the topic of nutrition.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.660]   And rather than get into specific meal programs,
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:52:00.860]   which would take hours and probably wouldn't even manage
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:02.860]   to scratch the surface even with hours,
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:07.360]   we could talk about principles around nutrition.
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.780]   What are sort of the themes
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.900]   that you think people should keep in mind
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:14.280]   in when thinking about how to eat generally?
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:19.060]   And pre-training and post-training
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.980]   are two particularly sensitive times for most,
[01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:24.740]   or times that people want to know a lot about.
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.460]   You know, what should they eat before training
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:27.780]   or can they train fasted?
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:29.020]   What should they eat afterwards?
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:32.260]   But just in general, what do you think are some axioms
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.980]   of nutrition that really hold?
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:37.700]   And I asked this because,
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:40.440]   not because there's a lot of debate about this,
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.440]   but because you've been around this space a long time
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.460]   and you've seen what works for you obviously,
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.540]   but for other people too.
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:51.860]   You know, what tends to work, what tends not to work?
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:54.380]   And how should we think about nutrition?
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:56.880]   - I mean, look, you've touched on it a bit,
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.220]   but like, you know,
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.540]   nutrition can be a touchy subject for people.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.740]   And I understand where that comes from.
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:05.500]   I've talked about before the,
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.880]   there's a dogmatic tendency to nutrition
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:08.860]   and there's a reason for it
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:12.340]   because it's an area that people struggle with.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:13.440]   More than anything else.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.520]   And the reason why people struggle with nutrition
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.340]   is because the commitment is extremely high.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:21.820]   You know, you could start a workout program
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:24.660]   and actually get to the gym three to five times a week.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.140]   That's five hours,
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:28.480]   based on how you and I were discussing it before.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.840]   Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days?
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.940]   There's opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily.
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.260]   Every one of those hours,
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:39.000]   people wake up in the middle of the night to go eat.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.260]   You know, like there are things that you can do
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.820]   that can cause amazing amounts of damage
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.620]   to your longevity in the 23 hours,
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:50.380]   not the one hour, the 23 hours.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:54.000]   So when people finally figure out a way
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.940]   to make that work for them, it's very passionate.
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.800]   And I understand their passion.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.060]   I do, like I've put out.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:02.700]   So my approach, my approach is like,
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.640]   I've always been sort of a low sugar, lower fat guy.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.280]   I made the mistake of going no fat years ago
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.120]   and I paid for it.
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:11.100]   I was like in college.
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:13.300]   And you know, back in the day we were the same age.
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:15.060]   You know, we read all the magazines
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.040]   and that was what we had.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:16.920]   We didn't have internet then.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.480]   So we were reading magazines
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.180]   and the recommended path was to go low fat.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:25.580]   It helps you to become hypocaloric very easily
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:28.340]   because the density of the calories, you know,
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:31.100]   in a gram of fat versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:34.400]   is nine versus four for the carbs and protein.
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.060]   So if you're cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis,
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:38.980]   you're quickly cutting out calories
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:40.740]   that allows you to get leaner.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.420]   Well, of course that's everything.
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:45.060]   I mean, if a little is good, then a lot is better.
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:48.380]   So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:52.140]   And at the age of 22, 21,
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.700]   I'm like standing at a stop up at University of Connecticut
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:58.620]   waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:00.640]   And I couldn't even open my eyes
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.860]   because the light was blinding to me.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:04.260]   It was normal sunlight.
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:05.100]   It was blinding to me.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.300]   The photosensitivity I had, you know,
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:09.460]   learning later on after a few more courses
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.180]   that I took there in biology, you know,
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:15.180]   how, you know, necessary fat was
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:18.860]   for the development of healthy, you know, cells.
[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.800]   I realized what was going on.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.780]   And not to mention other stuff,
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:25.200]   skin was bad, hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.200]   So I think that the approach to decreasing fat
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.220]   so it's not excessive, you know,
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.860]   because again, how calorically dense it could be
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:36.060]   and having lower sugar.
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:38.260]   I don't, I'm a firm believer in sugar
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:40.800]   is really pretty toxic and something
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.920]   that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:48.420]   That is the best approach for, I believe, again,
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:52.220]   in my opinion, personally, for the overall big picture,
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:55.820]   because though the people can take exclusionary approaches
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:57.780]   to nutrition and taking carbs out,
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:01.200]   or, you know, eating only fats and proteins,
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.740]   or again, I'm not saying it doesn't work for you.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:05.700]   And if it's the first thing that actually allowed you
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.960]   to gain control of your nutrition
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.260]   to the point where you actually saw results
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:09.860]   and got to a healthier weight,
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:11.780]   then I always say, then do it, then do it,
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.020]   but just make sure it's something you can do forever
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:16.980]   and doesn't bring upon other repercussions.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:21.900]   But I think that non-exclusionary approaches to diets
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:25.760]   are the most sustainable for the rest of your life.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.360]   And when I, and all I'm interested in
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.540]   from a nutrition standpoint is something that's sustainable.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.760]   So when I preach what I preach,
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.660]   I've been doing this since I was 15, 14, you know,
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.640]   people say like, how does he get so ripped?
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.100]   How does he get, I have been doing this for four,
[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:42.720]   since, for how many years, 30, 30 years?
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:44.080]   - Eating clean, low sugar.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.860]   - Yeah, 30 years, you know, and in the beginning,
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:50.420]   it was a slow shift I had to make where I was like,
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:53.180]   I went from the worst diet in the whole world.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:56.080]   I was, even when I was 14 years old,
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.740]   my breakfast was, I talked about this so many times,
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:01.360]   but like enemins, I would eat enemins, you know, donuts,
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.160]   and- - Those long road-
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.300]   - Yeah, those long boxes. - Yeah.
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.880]   - Even took the whole out of the donut.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:08.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:11.800]   - Why would you delete the middle of the donut?
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:15.280]   - You know, the crumb donut there, I would eat donut.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.480]   - I can taste it in my, I don't like sugar very much,
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.800]   but over the years, I've lost my appetite for sugar.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:20.720]   - Right. - But as you talk
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.960]   about the enemins, I can literally smell
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.560]   and taste the frosting.
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:25.840]   And to me now it's disgusting,
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.760]   but back then it might've been appetizing.
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.580]   - You would probably have like really good information
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:33.600]   on this, but like my ability to actually remember,
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.740]   and they've said smell is very evoking of memories, right?
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.940]   - So smell is unlike the other senses
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.500]   because there's a direct line, literally,
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.980]   from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.900]   It doesn't have to go through any intermediate stations.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:51.160]   - Okay, so, you know, my ability to actually recall
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.260]   exact taste of all the stuff that I used to love
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:59.260]   is enough to satisfy me to not engage in those things now.
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:02.020]   As crazy as that is, like I almost get my fill
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.360]   through remembering 'cause of these strong senses of memory
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.200]   of what it was like.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.400]   It was, "Oh, that used to taste so good.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.720]   "Okay, that's good, I had it."
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:09.840]   - Fantastic. - Yeah.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:12.480]   - Well, that's, we know the neuromodulator there,
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:13.600]   that's dopamine. - Yeah.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.760]   - Your ability to get the dopamine release
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.440]   from the thought of something.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:20.280]   Most people, when they get that dopamine release,
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.080]   it causes a triggering of the desire for more, right?
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.640]   People think of dopamine as pleasure.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:27.600]   Dopamine, there's a book, great book,
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.720]   called "The Molecule of More."
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.060]   I didn't write the book, unfortunately,
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.240]   but someone else did.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.240]   And it's a great book and it's really about how dopamine,
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.940]   we think it's about pleasure, but it establishes craving.
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.460]   So you're able to satisfy that
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.340]   and it's a very adaptive thing for you
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.820]   because you are indeed very lean.
[01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:45.220]   And that's one of your kind of hallmark things.
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:48.160]   And as a professional who does this in the public space,
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.860]   that's important when people are out there
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:51.620]   talking about getting lean and you look at them
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:55.700]   and you're like, maybe you need to do the protocols.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:56.720]   It's a huge advantage.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:59.100]   But yeah, I think that it sounds like
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:03.240]   you've cultivated practices around avoiding certain things.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:04.080]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:07.160]   I mean, but not, you know, avoiding certain things
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.980]   that I think are easily avoided if you realize that there,
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.440]   I mean, I think that we have enough science
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.920]   and literature out there to prove
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:17.520]   that the altered path is a better path.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.760]   You know what I mean?
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.960]   Like, I feel like if I was just doing it
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.300]   because I wanted to be lean,
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:25.800]   I'm not quite sure it would have held for so long, you know?
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.460]   - And we have a guest whose episode has been recorded
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:32.300]   for this podcast who runs an eating disorder clinic
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.840]   at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School,
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.460]   studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD,
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:39.900]   and he will go on record, and obesity,
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.380]   and he will go on record saying that
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:45.060]   these very highly palatable processed high sugar foods
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:46.820]   of the sort that we're talking about,
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.820]   donuts and so forth, that they are actually dangerous, right?
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:54.200]   That there are elements of the way
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.000]   that they engage neural circuitry, he's a neurosurgeon,
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.140]   that reshape the brain in dangerous ways,
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:01.260]   and those are his words, and-
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.500]   - Yeah, tank enemins, for sure.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.700]   - Yeah, and it's not just enemins.
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:07.520]   I mean, I think not just enemins, right?
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:09.420]   Yeah, they're coming after us with what?
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:10.260]   With donuts.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.100]   - Exactly.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:12.820]   - Yeah, they can't catch us.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.660]   - True, true.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:18.780]   - In any case, so in terms of what you do eat,
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:21.520]   how do you structure that in terms of,
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.860]   when you look down at a plate,
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.680]   you've done these, you've described this before,
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:26.900]   but I think it's just a beautifully simple description,
[02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:27.740]   'cause I think a lot of people
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:29.780]   don't want to do calorie counting and all this,
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:34.780]   and how should people think about what to eat?
[02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:37.780]   - So yeah, I have what I call a plate method,
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.580]   and it's just simple 'cause it works for me,
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:45.220]   and again, if you're struggling with real eating issues,
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:49.320]   these mechanisms become admittedly less effective
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.620]   because you're having,
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.000]   maybe you have emotionally triggered eating,
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.760]   and you can't stop at one plate.
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.740]   I mean, you can get the plate right,
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:57.460]   but if the portions are out of control.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:00.660]   - Plate, plate has the dimensionality of height.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.940]   - Or multiple plates, like second and third plates,
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:04.780]   or plate, right?
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:07.080]   Like then, all these things can be challenged,
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.880]   but what I say is, when you have your plate,
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.660]   then you just simply look at it as like a clock, right?
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:19.740]   And if you just make a 920 on the clock,
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:22.080]   so one arm goes over to the nine,
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.200]   and one of the arms goes over to 20,
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:25.720]   well then you're basically,
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:29.280]   you're gonna take the second largest portion of that,
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.740]   'cause you're gonna make a line towards 12 o'clock too,
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:33.940]   and the largest portion is gonna be
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.100]   your fibrous carbohydrates.
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:38.600]   So that's the green vegetables, all right?
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:40.820]   So whether it be broccoli, or Brussels sprouts,
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:45.820]   or asparagus, or pick your favorites.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:47.400]   Those are the ones that give us
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.900]   a lot of the micronutrients we need.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:52.940]   They're the ones that are generally accepted as more healthy,
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:54.800]   and they're also gonna provide the fiber
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.340]   that's gonna be both beneficial
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.500]   in terms of its impact on insulin,
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:01.220]   and also just through filling you up, right?
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:04.600]   And then I take the next largest portion of that,
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.700]   and I devote that towards protein.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.780]   And I think it's really important,
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.100]   especially for anybody active.
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:11.140]   The more active you are,
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.180]   the more you embark on trying to build muscle,
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:15.020]   you're gonna need to have protein every meal,
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:15.920]   so I have that.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.160]   And again, we're talking cleaner sources of protein,
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:22.840]   but you'll never find boiled chicken on my plate.
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.120]   I ditched those days when I was 16, or 15, or 16.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.480]   I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:31.260]   that maybe the low-fat thing stuck for too long,
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.760]   or the no-fat thing stuck for too long,
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.420]   but the boiled chicken and a steamed broccoli thing,
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:39.440]   that ended quickly for me,
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.420]   'cause I'm not gonna eat this forever.
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.320]   So I'll have some sort of fish or chicken,
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.300]   but it will be cooked in a way that's like,
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.980]   it's got maybe some sauce on it,
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:52.220]   or it's got some, maybe it's tomato sauce,
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:54.220]   anything to just make it a little bit more palatable
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:56.540]   and interesting without blowing the value of the meal.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.740]   And then that last portion
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:00.060]   is where I put my starchy carbohydrates.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:01.700]   And again, that's the part that some people will say,
[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:03.380]   exclude them entirely 'cause they're not healthy,
[02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:04.400]   or they don't work for you,
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.860]   or they're not beneficial long-term.
[02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:08.940]   For me, it's been a godsend.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.540]   And I do think I'm like most people,
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.780]   my body craves those carbohydrates.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:17.360]   I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my favorite,
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.140]   or I'll have rice, or I'll have pasta.
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.620]   I'm Italian, so I like pasta.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.580]   I will have those things.
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:25.520]   I'm not excluding them,
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.900]   but I don't put them in the portions
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.400]   that you would generally find.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.600]   My wife and I will go out and we'll go to the restaurant
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:34.260]   sometimes because we travel quite a bit,
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.260]   or used to at least with baseball too.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.100]   There's a Cheesecake Factory everywhere you went.
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.820]   And I love Cheesecake Factory,
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.180]   but the way they structure meals is it's all rice
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:46.220]   on the bottom and a little bit of chicken on top.
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.540]   And I mean, it's a plate full of rice
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:50.780]   that you wouldn't find me make a plate that way.
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:53.180]   I'm going to just devote that portion of the plate
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:55.100]   to the starchy carbohydrate.
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:57.380]   And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.580]   in terms of portion control.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:01.000]   'Cause those are the foods, again,
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.280]   probably dopamine-driven that are most easily overeaten.
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.980]   I always ask the question,
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.540]   how was the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal?
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.940]   Like you're getting sick of it after maybe two or three,
[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:14.620]   but you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates,
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:18.060]   starchy carbohydrates, because they're just so satisfying.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.660]   And I think those triggers, as you said,
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.860]   the want more, like that's what happens, right?
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:23.580]   You just keep, even when you're feeling full,
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:25.300]   you want more.
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:27.420]   And that's the biggest danger to carbohydrates.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:31.120]   So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them,
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:33.140]   then you can still enjoy them.
[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:37.040]   If you can't develop that discipline for whatever reason,
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.460]   then maybe they do become something
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:39.900]   that you have to work yourself around
[02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.260]   or adopt a different eating style.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:43.420]   And as I said, I'm never to the point
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:45.860]   where I'm not trying to be dogmatic in my approach.
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:48.020]   I'm always trying to say, this is how I do it.
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:49.480]   And I'm a believer in it,
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:51.780]   just like everyone else is believer in their method.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:55.020]   But I'm open to the idea that something that works for you
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:59.220]   and gets you to a healthier weight and a sustainability,
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:00.380]   like that is good.
[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:01.660]   That's good for me.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:04.820]   Provided it doesn't introduce other issues.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.620]   - Yeah, something one can do consistently.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:10.140]   That's something I picked up from you over the years.
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.240]   What can you do consistently?
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:14.860]   And for me, that also meant when and how can I eat?
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:16.300]   What can I eat consistently
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.380]   that will also allow me to be alert after lunch
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:21.720]   so I can actually get some work done or eat?
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.220]   I like to train fasted in the morning,
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:24.620]   but I don't do any long-term fasting.
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:28.200]   It just so happens that I'm fine doing water and caffeine
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:30.180]   in the morning and training in the morning,
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.260]   and then I eat my first meal afterwards.
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:33.980]   But I get carbohydrates at night,
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:35.740]   so my glycogen is restored.
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.740]   I think carbohydrates are wonderful.
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:39.320]   I just don't eat them in excess.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:42.020]   So to me, I feel like when,
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.620]   what you describe as a very rational,
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.440]   literally balanced approach,
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.340]   and obviously there will be variations
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:49.780]   for people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes,
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:53.620]   or I've got friends that are on the pure carnivore thing.
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:54.700]   I have friends that are vegan,
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:57.260]   and it's always impressive to me
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:01.400]   when somebody can stick to anything consistently,
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:04.180]   except when they're sticking to just poor behavior
[02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:06.540]   'cause there's nothing impressive about that.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:09.420]   Well, I think that that's very helpful
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.460]   because I think there's,
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:13.540]   for the typical listener of this podcast,
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:16.420]   you know, the online content that people see,
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:18.340]   the battles are very confusing.
[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:21.100]   They're distracting because people really think,
[02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:22.620]   oh, there's a right way and a wrong way.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:26.340]   And it sounds like the way that one can eat consistently
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:27.660]   over time that's healthy,
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:30.920]   certainly fewer processed and sugary foods.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.620]   I think almost everybody agrees there.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:34.400]   - Yeah, almost everyone agrees on that, right?
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:37.800]   So I think it's calorie manipulation
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.140]   through some other method, right?
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:43.260]   So even intermittent fasting, like you said,
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:46.840]   that could be, it's for people that are grazers.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:49.180]   Like if you are a grazer and your real problem
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.700]   is portion control over the course of the day,
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.460]   but you can respond to a rule that says no,
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:56.300]   you're eating between here and here,
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:58.060]   that you can obey that rule.
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:00.820]   Well, you're not gonna be able to graze during the times
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.420]   that you might be doing additional damage.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.620]   So sure, there's other hormonal benefits
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:08.500]   that people will talk about from that approach,
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.860]   but from a longevity standpoint
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.460]   and habit forming standpoint,
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:16.220]   if it's fixing the habit that you're breaking too often
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.060]   by eating throughout,
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:21.260]   whenever you feel like you walk by food, it's good.
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.100]   And it works.
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:25.520]   And again, people will tell you,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.220]   you can probably eat whatever you wanna eat
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.520]   as long as you're eating within that window.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.540]   But I think the more responsible people
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:33.480]   who are practitioners of that will say,
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:35.680]   no, you still wanna avoid processed sugar
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:36.960]   and things like that.
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.300]   So, and that's just a mechanism of eating,
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:40.300]   not really a diet, right?
[02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:43.040]   But like, I think that people,
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:47.380]   I hate to be as like as basic as it sounds with that,
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:49.260]   but it's for the exact reason that
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:52.100]   if it's that 23 hour day phenomenon,
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:54.340]   that it's like, you said you're impressed,
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:55.300]   it is impressive.
[02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:58.100]   It's so hard to control all of our behaviors
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.860]   and food being one of the hardest thing,
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:01.980]   one of the biggest temptations for people.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:04.180]   You gotta learn how to control that for so long
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.080]   and then do it day after day after day.
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.460]   Whatever that mechanism is that works for you
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:15.220]   is impressive and I'm a believer in it.
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.900]   I think that's how I feel.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.340]   I just feel like people need to be able
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:20.620]   to be given some reigns
[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:23.420]   to be able to find what works for them.
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:24.420]   - Well, I love to eat.
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:26.020]   And one of the beauties of weight training
[02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:29.140]   is I feel like I can eat plenty for my age
[02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:30.820]   and I'm not as lean as you are,
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:33.340]   but I'm happy with where I'm at.
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:35.060]   I could always do better.
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:37.620]   With each year, actually, I'm getting better,
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:39.100]   probably because I'm eating cleaner,
[02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.580]   probably because I also have someone to cook for me now.
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:46.580]   And we like healthy food and so I'm very fortunate.
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.820]   I don't think we have any packaged food in our home.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:51.660]   We even started making sauerkraut at home.
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:53.100]   I don't make it, she makes it.
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:55.100]   - Well, my wife actually,
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:58.020]   she turned me on to a tip that I actually shared
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:08:59.980]   with the whole channel, which was like,
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:04.260]   you can go to, we have a Stu Leonard's
[02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:07.060]   around our big grocery store chain around us
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:08.700]   and they have a catering department
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:11.260]   and they're often used for catering big parties
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:13.700]   and big tubs of grilled chicken,
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.860]   but like really good grilled chicken.
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:16.900]   Again, not the boiled chicken,
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:18.980]   but big tubs of sweet potatoes.
[02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:22.140]   And we'll get a bunch of those
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:22.980]   and she'll go over and she'll get them
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:26.300]   and then she'll sort of arrange them on plates
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:27.660]   and put the plates in.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.660]   And like, I'm okay with repetitive eating.
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:31.380]   I think more people are probably okay
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.980]   with repetitive eating than they think.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:35.980]   I think that when you actually break down,
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.980]   how many different breakfast variety,
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:38.940]   like variations do you have?
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:40.220]   Three, two?
[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:41.380]   - Two or three, maximum.
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:42.620]   - So like, I think when people do,
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.460]   there's more variety for dinner probably,
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:45.860]   but like even there,
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:48.180]   you probably eat five different types of dinners
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:50.740]   over the course of a week or a month.
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:53.020]   Well, if you have that ability
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.340]   to identify the things that you like,
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:56.940]   and again, no plan is going to work
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:58.100]   if you're eating stuff you don't like.
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:00.300]   It's not going to work forever, nothing will.
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.940]   You have to really enjoy what you're eating.
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:05.940]   As long as these variations of this meal
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:08.020]   are something that you really enjoy,
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:10.740]   and there are limited versions of them,
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:13.700]   the reproducibility of that is simple.
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.900]   It will take some time,
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:16.500]   but if you're fortunate enough in our case
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.420]   to have somebody who can prepare it for you,
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:20.660]   now that's even part out of the equation.
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:23.540]   And it's like, it just makes it very simple.
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:27.140]   But I do think when you tally up all the costs
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:32.140]   of medical care that are spiked by having poor nutrition,
[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:36.060]   and you then offset that by what it might cost you
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:39.540]   to invest in a faster strategy like this catering trick
[02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:40.820]   or whatever it might be,
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.860]   you'd be best off figuring out a way
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.660]   to maybe reallocate some of your money
[02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:47.220]   to preparing this because you know how important it is
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:49.300]   to your long-term health and longevity.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:52.380]   If you can figure out your nutrition issues,
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:53.820]   if everyone listening to this podcast
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:55.980]   can figure out their nutrition issues,
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:57.500]   this whole world will be different.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:00.380]   That is like one of the largest sources of disease
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:02.180]   and pain and discomfort
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.180]   because people really struggle with nutrition.
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:05.940]   - Yeah, and it's a huge problem.
[02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:09.580]   I mean, the obesity, it is an epidemic in this country.
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:11.180]   It's very, very serious.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:13.140]   Also, a lot of highly processed foods
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.580]   are more expensive than healthier foods
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:17.220]   when you really break it down.
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:21.160]   Even the better sourced high quality foods
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.580]   are right there on par less than the processed foods,
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:26.420]   for sure.
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:31.540]   I have a couple other questions as it relates to training
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:34.020]   because I think that one thing
[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:36.740]   that a lot of people wonder about,
[02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:39.740]   and maybe we could do this in kind of a true/false method
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:42.900]   just to get through some of these.
[02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:44.500]   - 50/50, I'll get it right at least.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.340]   - Exactly.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:48.300]   Men and women should train differently.
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:50.000]   - The science of it will say false.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:50.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:54.680]   - And again, not to generalize,
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.420]   but kind of the point you touched on earlier today,
[02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:02.420]   I do find that casually interested women in training
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:05.940]   will migrate more towards certain types of fitness,
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:08.420]   like kickboxing, like dancing,
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.700]   like low-rest circuit type.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:12.660]   And I think, again,
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:16.020]   whatever it is that you're going to engage in regularly
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:17.340]   is what you should do.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:18.500]   Physiologically, no.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.920]   And I think if we can get more women
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:23.480]   to feel more comfortable in the gym,
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.080]   performing the same exercises
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:29.040]   and receiving the same strength training benefits
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.480]   and working on progressive overload,
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:32.300]   and like, yeah, we've hit the holy grail.
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:35.840]   But I think that it's a big bridge
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.320]   that has to be gapped still
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:41.000]   because there's just some reality to,
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.360]   listen, there are very,
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:45.980]   my wife is a perfect example of this,
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:49.240]   living a very complicated, busy life.
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:51.580]   We have two young boys, they're twins,
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:55.400]   and her attention and focus is there.
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.680]   And it's like, she doesn't do this for a living like I do.
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:02.040]   And if she can get a decent workout in, she's happy,
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.520]   but she's not necessarily working on her deadlift PR.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:08.240]   And so I think that that would help her
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:10.680]   and serve her in the longterm
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:13.920]   to work on increasing her PRs and different lifts
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:15.460]   and building her strength progressively.
[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:18.280]   But in her life right now,
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:19.680]   it's not necessarily in the cards
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.480]   to have the time to focus on that.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:24.440]   So would you then discourage this other thing
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:25.920]   that she might find interesting?
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.400]   Like some boxing, there was a little,
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:31.240]   I don't remember the brand,
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.200]   but like one of those punchable boxing standup things,
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.960]   and she enjoys it.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:40.920]   And anything to get you moving is going to be preferable,
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.040]   but I don't think that necessarily physiologically
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.680]   there's a difference.
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:46.300]   - You started weight training pretty young.
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:50.040]   - Yeah, I messed around with my brother
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.520]   'cause he was older, he was four years older.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:52.840]   So I was kind of messing around with weights,
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:55.160]   probably 12 or 13 with a five pound dumbbell.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.360]   - Okay, yeah, you hear that young kids
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.680]   shouldn't work out with the weights.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:00.560]   I don't know what the going standard is now.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:02.480]   They say, shuts down long bone growth
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:05.840]   or growth plates, this sort of thing.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.160]   You've got two young boys, adorable kids, by the way.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:11.640]   Yeah, one of the things that is very heartwarming
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.440]   is to see that you're in great shape,
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.480]   you're extremely bright, you know your craft,
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.080]   you love your craft.
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.700]   You work with Jesse, who we'll talk about as well,
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:21.640]   which is great.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.900]   You know that there's a camaraderie there,
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.920]   having great teammates as part of a business
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:28.440]   or to work out with just makes life better.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:29.580]   Let's just be honest.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:31.600]   I'm grateful to have great teammates for the podcast
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.240]   and my lab, of course, as well.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:38.520]   But to see your boys and your dogs and the whole picture,
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.640]   you know, I'm sure it has a lot of contours and complexity
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.480]   that we don't know about and shouldn't know about,
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:45.820]   but it's a beautiful picture.
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:48.840]   And will they weight train?
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:51.160]   I've seen the videos of one or both of them
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.000]   hanging from the box.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.320]   - These kids are naturals, I'm telling you that.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.640]   - I wonder where they get it from.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.480]   - I don't even, you know, I don't even encourage it.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:00.120]   I'm not going to be the dad who's sitting there saying,
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.700]   "Let's go, son."
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:02.960]   Yeah, we got our two days here.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.540]   I'm not going to do that.
[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:07.940]   But they have a natural interest in the gym.
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:09.780]   They just sometimes like to be out with daddy.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:13.140]   So they'll come out there and, you know, I,
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:15.180]   of the two of us, my wife and I will be the one
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:17.700]   who has a little bit more of a longer leash
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.100]   to let them explore things.
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:20.980]   'Cause I was a dummy at times too,
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:23.000]   and figured out best through the mistakes I made.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.420]   - Through injury.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:26.600]   In neuroscience, we call that one trial learning.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:28.500]   - There you go, these guys are going to be masters
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:31.460]   of one trial learning because, you know, they'll go grab,
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.260]   you know, the bars of my, the handles of my jammer.
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:36.220]   Yeah, that's there, 'cause it's at a lower level to them.
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:37.300]   And they're swinging around,
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.780]   they're doing pull-ups on it naturally.
[02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.940]   Uncoached, nothing from me.
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:42.500]   One will walk up to a deadlift bar,
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:44.900]   stand over it naturally, never saw me do it.
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:46.820]   Stands over there and just goes (growls)
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:47.820]   tries to pull it.
[02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:50.000]   So there's a, there's a definitely an inclination
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.940]   to liking the gym and I will fully support that.
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:54.180]   But of course, you know,
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:56.180]   body weight will be good for quite a while.
[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:57.940]   - So what age do you think is reasonable
[02:15:57.940 --> 02:16:01.620]   for kids to start exploring a non body weight training?
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.860]   - I think around 13, you know, I think around 13.
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.640]   Once puberty, I think it's okay to start to, you know,
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.140]   'cause there's so much,
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:12.740]   I even say for people that are like later in age
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:13.640]   who are just starting out,
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:14.820]   learn with your own body weight first.
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:16.540]   There's plenty of resistance to be had
[02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.640]   by learning how to command your body in space.
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:21.580]   So if you have never trained before,
[02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:23.440]   you're going to get very stimulated
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:25.380]   by doing lunging and reverse lunging,
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:26.860]   even learning some of the proprioception
[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:29.340]   around movement through space, pull-ups, chin-ups,
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.440]   pull-ups and chin-ups are challenging
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:31.700]   for even people that have had
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:33.680]   20, 30 years of experience in the gym.
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:37.180]   So there's a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:40.720]   and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:42.180]   is actually doing yourself a disservice.
[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:44.920]   You can learn better command of your body in space
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.060]   so that when you go back to the bigger lifts,
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:49.620]   you're going to have an easier time
[02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:51.100]   sort of progressively loading them
[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:52.900]   and building up that foundation of strength.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:54.300]   I'm not saying that you have to become
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:56.020]   a master calisthenics athlete
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.140]   before you can touch a barbell, that's not even true.
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:00.200]   I'm just saying there's so much capacity.
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:01.480]   Kids are going to be doing this anyway.
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.700]   And really just, if you look at general play,
[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:06.340]   they are jumping, they are lunging, they are climbing,
[02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:08.820]   they are pulling, that's what they do.
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:12.620]   So I don't know where the avoidance
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:15.580]   of structured training is for younger kids.
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:17.220]   Again, provided they're using body weight
[02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:21.480]   and maybe less ballistic movements or something like that,
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:25.060]   things that are certainly overloaded movements,
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.860]   I think we should encourage kids to do more.
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:31.140]   There's a lot of obesity in kids on the rise also
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:34.180]   and that is incredibly disconcerting to me.
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:37.380]   So I think, and I hope it doesn't come from the advice
[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:39.300]   of some that say, well, wait until you're older
[02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:40.260]   to start doing something.
[02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:42.220]   Like that's a way worse trade off
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:45.340]   than engaging in something smart now.
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:46.640]   - We used to get kicked out of the house
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:47.580]   when we were kids. - Totally.
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:49.180]   - My mom would kick us out. - Right.
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:52.260]   - I had a huge pack of boys that lived on my street,
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:54.100]   but we'd get kicked out side.
[02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:57.660]   Like literally you're not allowed in the, no television.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.160]   There were video games of course,
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:00.540]   but we were kicked out of the house.
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:01.380]   We had to go play.
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:02.740]   For us it was skateboarding, soccer,
[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:04.700]   and then we'd find our trouble.
[02:18:04.700 --> 02:18:09.700]   But post-training nutrition, we're the same age.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:14.080]   Years ago, I was sort of neurotic about the idea
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.680]   that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:18.380]   and proteins within two hours,
[02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:20.540]   then it was 90 minutes of training.
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.620]   I confess I get, if I train hard,
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:23.940]   so I'm talking about the resistance training,
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:26.380]   not the running, but the resistance training,
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:30.500]   you know, 60 to 90 minutes later, I'm really hungry.
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:32.480]   But there've been days when I just skip
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:35.180]   and then the hunger passes and then later I eat more.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.560]   I might eat twice as much later.
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:39.080]   You know, that's just the way sometimes schedules go.
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:43.060]   But what are your thoughts in terms of the nutrition science,
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.380]   the training related effects of the post-training meal?
[02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:50.060]   Is it something that you try to get?
[02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:50.900]   Is it something that you think
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:52.900]   people should pay attention to?
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:56.000]   - So that science has actually probably been the one
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.360]   that's changed the most in my lifetime, honestly,
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.660]   because I, again, we're the same age
[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:04.460]   and I was falling for the same trap,
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:08.060]   you know, where I would really be focused on,
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:10.220]   like I'm risking speeding tickets,
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:12.340]   driving home from the gym to make sure
[02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:15.220]   I got an anabolic window, you know, like I did all that.
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:16.660]   I really did, you know.
[02:19:16.660 --> 02:19:19.360]   But thankfully that's been sort of debunked
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:22.340]   and your body isn't just rushing through, you know,
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:23.560]   these certain periods of time
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.040]   to utilize the nutrients in our body,
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:26.320]   but are able to partition them
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.020]   and use them over a long, much greater duration.
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.660]   Up to now they're saying, you know, three to four hours
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:33.600]   after training, five hours after training,
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:37.180]   you can still see the benefits of replenishment.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:38.740]   A lot of that is just, you know,
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:40.860]   I think there's a consistency element to it
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:46.760]   that just utilizing a post-workout window
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:48.460]   or a post-workout meal,
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:51.040]   even if it's within two hours or one hour,
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.260]   is just integrating the habit of saying,
[02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:55.660]   listen, I just did this activity
[02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:58.020]   and now I want to replenish some of what I lost,
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:20:02.380]   the energy that I used to perform the exercises that I did.
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.420]   And just getting into the routine,
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:08.260]   knowing that the engine is ultimately fed
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:09.580]   by what we put in it.
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:14.000]   And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.980]   is still a concept that I think, again,
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:18.360]   different in mechanism, but still important
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:20.540]   in terms of fueling the overall performance.
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:24.440]   So, you know, the pre-workout period of time
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:28.040]   gives us a chance to actually have a longer window
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:31.480]   because if those nutrients are obtained pre-workout,
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:34.640]   it's not like they're gone in that hour that you've trained.
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.560]   They're still there and available for your body to use.
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:38.400]   So, you know, I think it's important
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:40.440]   to get one of the two, you know, right?
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:42.440]   Or at least make sure you're consistently
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:45.300]   having one or the two,
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:48.280]   or you might risk going through all these periods
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:51.620]   of having no nutrition to support your efforts.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:53.400]   Not only will your workouts potentially suffer
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:54.520]   in terms of the output,
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:56.640]   but then you're also not providing your body
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:01.280]   any ability to capitalize on an opportunity to feed it
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:02.800]   and refuel and recover.
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:07.800]   So, I'm not very dogmatic about what specifically
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:11.400]   to eat pre or post, you know, workout,
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:13.880]   but I do think you should have protein
[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.640]   surrounding your training,
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.960]   whether that be ahead of time or after.
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:21.000]   Protein could be a little bit hard to digest
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:21.840]   for some people.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:23.460]   So, if you do that pre-workout
[02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:25.500]   and then you're finding your workouts slogging
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.960]   because you don't feel good,
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:29.120]   then suddenly you put that after your meal.
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.400]   But this whole concept of the urgency of time
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:34.680]   has thankfully been removed
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:37.560]   and we can just learn to eat a little bit more,
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:40.960]   you know, responsibly and drive more responsibly
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:43.260]   so we're not, you know, trying to rush home from the gym
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:44.920]   and risk, you know, killing people on the way.
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:47.120]   You know, I think it's,
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:49.200]   but I think it's great because I think that
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.480]   that was something that it just showcases a belief
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:53.760]   that people had for so long
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:56.800]   that has since been proven to be not that important.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:00.320]   And there's a tip of the cap towards research in a good way
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:02.040]   where it's like, all right, I think we could all agree
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:04.680]   that this isn't necessarily true anymore.
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:08.040]   And look at yourself and say,
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:10.560]   oh my God, I did that so often.
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.480]   Like I bit that one hook, line and sinker,
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:15.720]   but then realize, okay, we could always make a change.
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:17.160]   And the good thing about nutrition is
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:19.720]   those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat,
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.520]   you know, and you'll start to see the benefits of that.
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:26.520]   So I'm not a big believer in that strict approach
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:29.320]   to pre or post workout.
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:32.080]   I mean, even as far as pre-workout supplements,
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.200]   a lot of people don't take them.
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:35.360]   A lot of people don't like them.
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:36.200]   They don't take them.
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:38.960]   They don't like, they're not necessarily even being used
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:42.160]   as the new nutritive side of the pre-workout.
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.000]   They're just more used to fuel the workout.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:49.120]   - For me, it's water and some form of caffeine.
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:51.440]   - Yeah, I mean, it's whatever, you know, again,
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:53.200]   I think it's important, I do think it's important
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:55.040]   to maintain a high level of output.
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:59.120]   So if your pre-workout nutrition requires a stimulant
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:00.240]   in order to help you do that,
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:03.660]   or if your pre-workout nutrition is causing you
[02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:06.920]   to have a harder time to train because you're feeling full
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:08.320]   or stomach ache or something else,
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.240]   then that's not achieving what you're trying to do.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:12.560]   The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:13.580]   at the highest level.
[02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:16.080]   So whatever your nutrition is required to allow you
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.520]   to still do that, that is probably the most important
[02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:19.760]   factor of all of it.
[02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:22.480]   - Great, I love the very clear and rational approach.
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:24.840]   Don't ingest anything right before your workout
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:27.960]   or near your workout that's going to make your workout worse.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:30.760]   I mean, it's so simple and yet you don't hear this
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:32.100]   because I think people will think, oh,
[02:23:32.100 --> 02:23:34.640]   they must have a pre-workout, they must have a post-workout.
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:37.780]   - Again, like even if the benefits that are to be had
[02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:41.440]   from whatever's being suggested is going to be easily offset
[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.480]   by the fact that you can't perform at an output
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:46.160]   capable of driving any change.
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:49.320]   So that would pretty much negate the fact that
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:51.280]   there's no, you're not outweighing those benefits
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:53.800]   of whatever nutritive approach you took
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:55.360]   and it's struggling through your workout.
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:58.240]   - Yeah, for me, the best pre-workout is a good night's sleep,
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:00.320]   hydration, caffeine, music.
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.440]   - Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:03.360]   I mean, it's a pretty simple formula.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:04.200]   - It works.
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:06.320]   And then post-workout, I do find I get quite hungry
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.160]   and want to eat quite a bit more.
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:09.400]   - Well, that's a natural response.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:11.880]   The body's going to, and most people want to do that
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.120]   and I think it should be fed.
[02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:17.200]   I work out as, again, a lot of my postings on Instagram
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.960]   will happen at 10 o'clock at night, 10.30 at night,
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:21.720]   11 at night, 'cause I am actually training there
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:23.020]   and that's where I'm taking those little breaks
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:25.400]   in between sets to actually film or post something.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.400]   But like I then go inside, I eat dinner.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.880]   So I'm eating at 11 o'clock at night.
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:31.760]   It's not necessarily ideal.
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:33.840]   I'm not recommending that as a tool for anybody.
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.240]   I think it dispels one thing.
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:38.320]   I've never been a believer in can eat carbs after six.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.000]   - Yeah, that makes no sense to me.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:40.840]   - Zero sense.
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:43.240]   And all the new, all the science of metabolism
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:44.520]   that I've seen makes no sense.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:47.040]   I think as long as you can, sort of like napping.
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:49.620]   I talked to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:51.480]   wrote "Why We Sleep," et cetera,
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:53.300]   and has his own podcast about sleep,
[02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:55.560]   tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep.
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:58.320]   And he said, naps are fine provided they don't interrupt
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.560]   your ability to sleep well at night.
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.400]   Simple.
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.060]   Some people can sleep from eight to 9 p.m.
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:04.820]   and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem.
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:06.820]   Other people, they take a 30 minute nap after lunch
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:08.120]   and they can't sleep at night.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:09.840]   Same thing with, caffeine's a little different
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:11.880]   because Matt would argue the architecture of sleep
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:12.920]   can be disrupted, et cetera.
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:16.440]   But if you can eat dinner late and eat carbohydrates late,
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:17.800]   I actually need carbohydrates at night
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:19.360]   in order to be able to sleep.
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.740]   Whenever I've done a low carbohydrate type regimen
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.720]   in the evening, I have a hard time falling asleep.
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.960]   I'm just too alert.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:28.440]   And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:31.800]   to restore glycogen, but also in order to make sure
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.100]   that I can fall asleep.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:36.520]   - I actually can, again, obviously it's already late
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:38.020]   at night by the time I'm done eating,
[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:40.780]   but I can fall asleep within five, 10 minutes
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:41.920]   of finishing my meal.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.560]   Because I do think that they have that same effect on me.
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:49.180]   But I'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness.
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:52.880]   I'm not unable to sleep because I'm feeling a fullness.
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:57.440]   But I do like the fact that I feel as if I'm at least
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:00.100]   replenishing what was lost through my hard training.
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:02.620]   And I do like to back it up with a dinner.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.460]   I don't need to eat smaller amounts.
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:05.920]   Some people can't have that much.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:07.700]   I will say after a hard leg workout,
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:09.280]   I don't have the same appetite that I do
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.980]   after let's say, an upper body workout.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:16.980]   It can really disrupt my whole feeling of wellbeing.
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:19.840]   - You want to eat less after you train your legs?
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:20.680]   - I do, yeah.
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:22.360]   - Oh wow, I'm the opposite.
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:23.680]   - No, 'cause I just feel like I could feel sick
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:24.800]   to my stomach.
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:26.240]   - You're clearly training harder.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:27.080]   I've seen the way you train.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:28.400]   You do train very intensely.
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.400]   - Yeah, I think it's important.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.960]   I mean, I think that again, it's that trade off
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.000]   between if you're not going to train
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.080]   for a long period of time,
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:38.900]   then you're going to want to train harder.
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:41.100]   And again, I actually feel like contrary
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:44.160]   to what people might think as you age,
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:45.960]   you're better off training harder
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.400]   for a shorter period of time.
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:52.060]   It's always within the realm of safe training.
[02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:53.720]   I mean, I think that's what I like to think.
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:54.800]   That's what I bring to the table,
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:58.120]   like an approach that's smarter so I can train harder.
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:01.480]   Like not doing the dumb things I did when I was a kid.
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:06.280]   And with that trade off being a harder trainer,
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.740]   I think I get the results that I want
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:11.480]   because I'm able to really push it and then back off.
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.480]   And again, the meal feels like almost a physiological reward
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:18.280]   for the hard effort I put in the gym,
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.200]   knowing that I'm also replenishing
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:22.740]   and setting the stage for the next day
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:25.240]   to be another successful day of training.
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.520]   Or maybe not, depending on how many times a week I train.
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:33.520]   But yeah, I think that it's a lot less,
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.360]   I hate to say, but it's a lot less scientific
[02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:38.880]   than we want to make it.
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:41.820]   And as it seems to be coming back oftentimes,
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:43.160]   like the thing that works for you
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:44.600]   is really the most important thing
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:46.520]   because ultimately getting your ass in there
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:48.320]   and doing what you do is really the thing
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:50.320]   that provides the best benefit.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:53.240]   - Absolutely, and there are many things
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:55.320]   that I would say are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere,
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:58.180]   but one of them is certainly consistency.
[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:00.600]   You make it happen one way or another.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.320]   Huge, I mean, consistency really is the determinant.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:07.640]   And I know that that is the hardest part for people
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:10.320]   and why people tend to look for the shortcut
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.800]   'cause consistency is the part
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:14.400]   that becomes the biggest challenge.
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:19.280]   But if you could find, listen, if you could find the,
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:20.640]   through what I've been trying to encourage here
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.400]   is like if you could find the nutrition approach,
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.720]   if you could find the training approach,
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:25.160]   if you could try to find the training split,
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.720]   if you could try, all those things that encourage you
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:28.600]   to want to go to the gym.
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:29.880]   Like you're locked in at the point
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.320]   where you said you actually look forward
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:33.360]   to going and doing your workout.
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:34.200]   - I love it.
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:36.480]   I look forward to, I mean, it's, you know,
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:39.920]   actually this morning one of our teammates for the podcast,
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:42.200]   I got a workout and halfway through I just turned to him
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:44.680]   and I said, "I'll never figure out why that feels so good,
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:45.680]   but it feels so good."
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:47.680]   I just, I really enjoy it and it lets,
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:49.320]   and I love to eat and it lets me eat
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:51.280]   and I love the way it makes me feel afterward.
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.640]   I don't understand this concept of not enjoying the gym.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.980]   Cardio is a little different.
[02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:58.920]   I always loathe the first 10 or 20 minutes of a jog.
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:02.640]   I mildly loathe the middle third and by the end,
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.100]   I think this is the greatest thing ever.
[02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:05.280]   Why don't I do it all at a time?
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:06.520]   And then that feeling evaporates
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:07.680]   before the next time I do it.
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:09.080]   - Yeah, of course you don't even remember it either.
[02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:10.880]   Next time you get on, you hate it again.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:11.720]   - Exactly.
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.560]   - Yeah, I think if people could,
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.080]   if we had one gift we could give to everybody,
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.880]   it would be the love of fitness, right?
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.920]   If they could be bestowed the love of fitness,
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:22.840]   it would change the entire world, you know?
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.000]   But I think when you hear things like this that like,
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.820]   "Hey, that will work and that will work too."
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:30.280]   And that this will work too.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:34.880]   Rather than the dogmatic one way only approach,
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:37.540]   which could become discouraging for people.
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:39.500]   Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting like,
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:40.680]   "Well, I've never tried that.
[02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:42.680]   I've actually never tried a total body split
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:45.440]   or I've never tried that style of eating."
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:48.340]   It becomes encouraging that you might want to explore
[02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:49.940]   and then you might finally get locked in and say,
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:50.880]   "I really like this."
[02:29:50.880 --> 02:29:52.200]   And then you're off and running.
[02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:55.720]   - That's what I so enjoy about your content.
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:30:00.720]   We would be remiss if we didn't briefly discuss Jesse.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:04.060]   One of the great pleasures for me in watching your content
[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:06.940]   and learning from it over the years is that you took on,
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:09.480]   you decided to mentor somebody, Jesse.
[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:12.160]   And there's some poking fun back and forth
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:13.860]   between the two of you, which is very amusing.
[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:17.320]   But I have to say it inspired me to do something early on
[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.880]   in developing this podcast as I have a young intern
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:23.080]   who has helped me with some of the research
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.940]   and he's interested in science.
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:26.060]   He's about to go off to college,
[02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:27.240]   but he also got really into fitness.
[02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:29.180]   We would watch the videos of you guys.
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:32.240]   He was helping me get the Instagram content out early on.
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:33.460]   And one thing that was just,
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.960]   it was such a pleasure to be able to pass along knowledge.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:37.840]   And of course I'm learning from him.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:39.240]   This is always the way it works.
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:42.160]   We learn from teaching and we learn from students.
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:44.200]   But it's been great to see Jesse's progress.
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:45.040]   It's amazing.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:47.760]   I've gotten to meet him in person just now.
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:51.460]   And he has grown, he's changed physically.
[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:53.620]   And I think that you mentioned a love of fitness.
[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:56.800]   I think that one of the best ways to be consistent
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:59.360]   is to take on the responsibility of teaching others
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.240]   once one has proficiency in something.
[02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:04.000]   So maybe you just tell us a little bit
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.080]   about how that's going, how is Jesse doing
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:08.760]   and where does he need a little more work?
[02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:10.480]   Where is he thriving?
[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:12.080]   I'm impressed by the progress.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.480]   - Well, we have, I mean, physically,
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:16.000]   we can obviously see the changes,
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.340]   the list of things to work on is immense.
[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:20.880]   It's so long for him to continue to improve.
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:25.100]   But no, actually, in reality, Jesse,
[02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:26.980]   the story of Jesse was that I knew Jesse
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:28.920]   prior to starting Even Athlean-X.
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:30.400]   And as a matter of fact, I think the funny thing
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:33.500]   is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.700]   was a video that he shot as, I don't know,
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:38.260]   a 13 year old or something.
[02:31:38.260 --> 02:31:40.060]   And I said, can you just film this for a second?
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:42.900]   I was over there training members of the family.
[02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:47.580]   So he then went off to college, went into film,
[02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:50.780]   realized he had much greener pastures at Athlean-X.
[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:53.340]   Instead of becoming the next Scorsese or something,
[02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:55.840]   and he decided to come work with me.
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:58.180]   And the expectations in the beginning
[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:02.100]   were just to edit videos or just to help
[02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:05.420]   with various aspects of my day to day
[02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:07.720]   that I don't think I was equipped to really handle
[02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:08.880]   and grow the business anymore.
[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:13.880]   So then look at, by virtue of being in that environment,
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:15.020]   there's an interest.
[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:17.020]   I think if I worked in a gym,
[02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:18.840]   I might become interested in working out.
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:20.620]   And though mine is not a commercial gym,
[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:24.820]   it's sitting right behind my office window,
[02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:26.180]   there became an interest in wanting
[02:32:26.180 --> 02:32:27.500]   to work out a little bit.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:32.020]   And it wasn't even an intentional experiment
[02:32:32.020 --> 02:32:33.480]   to put Jesse there.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.380]   I just thought that he's a very likable person.
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:38.340]   He has a very funny personality.
[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:39.800]   He's also the every man.
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:44.180]   In some ways, as I'm sure maybe you experience sometimes,
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:47.620]   like I'm the guy that this comes naturally for me
[02:32:47.620 --> 02:32:48.580]   is what people will say.
[02:32:48.580 --> 02:32:50.100]   Like, this is what you do for a living.
[02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.060]   This is what you like.
[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:52.800]   There's an element of disconnect
[02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:54.860]   in terms of the relatability
[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.840]   because I do do this for a living.
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.680]   I can't deny that.
[02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:59.380]   I do work with professional athletes.
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:02.300]   So like there's a level of interest in this above and beyond.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.620]   But for him, he's just the kid who wants to train
[02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:08.220]   maybe if he rolls out of bed before 11 a.m.
[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.140]   and doesn't have a date on Friday night.
[02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:13.280]   But that's the guy everybody can relate to.
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:15.980]   And watching him transform.
[02:33:15.980 --> 02:33:18.580]   And I love the fact that even the interest level
[02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:20.880]   was up and down.
[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:22.440]   Like it wasn't consistent for him
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:24.980]   because he was like part interested
[02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:26.400]   and then maybe not interested for three months
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.340]   and then interested in that.
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:29.180]   And I never pushed it on him.
[02:33:29.180 --> 02:33:31.480]   Again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me.
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:33.820]   It was just like, if you want to do this, then do this.
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:38.220]   And also from a standpoint of like lending my help
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:40.780]   or expertise to him, like I said with my son,
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:42.140]   I'm not going to force it on anybody.
[02:33:42.140 --> 02:33:43.340]   I don't want to do that to anybody.
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:46.600]   I don't think that that's ever going to spark that desire
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:48.540]   for long term adoption.
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:50.700]   So he got more interested.
[02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:52.000]   He started to learn more about it.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.740]   He watches the videos that we're filming.
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:55.300]   He films the videos that we're filming.
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:56.760]   And he's learning through what I'm saying.
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:59.940]   He's becoming more of a student of the field.
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:02.840]   And I have to say his knowledge in the field
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:05.840]   has grown with the growth of his physique.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:08.500]   And he's put into practice some of the things that I say.
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:10.680]   He's put in practice some things he hears other places
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:13.580]   and he winds up improving as he goes.
[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:16.020]   And he winds up starting to love this
[02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:18.420]   like he never thought he would.
[02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:22.760]   But it's great to see anybody grow.
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:25.660]   And whether that be physically or that be emotionally
[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:28.860]   or whether it be just in their career,
[02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:30.220]   it's great to see somebody grow.
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:35.220]   And I like to tease him, funny admission here.
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:38.880]   There are times when the jabs that I will throw at him
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:40.860]   are something that we might know ahead of time
[02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:42.420]   of what I'm going to say to him.
[02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:45.700]   People will say, you're so mean to him.
[02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:48.620]   I can't believe it, that's so abusive.
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:51.380]   Yeah, like dude, honestly, we laugh after it's over.
[02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:53.100]   It's good, we're good.
[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:54.780]   So, of course, but like--
[02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:56.620]   - He's tougher than he looks is what you're saying.
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:57.460]   - He's tougher than he looks.
[02:34:57.460 --> 02:34:58.620]   Believe me, believe me. - And he looks pretty tough
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:00.180]   now, he's got the big beard.
[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:01.420]   - He looks more manly than I do.
[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:02.540]   I can't grow a beard.
[02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:03.380]   I don't, yeah.
[02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:05.660]   I mean, believe me, he's totally alpha.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:09.580]   And I'm like, quickly becoming the second star of this show.
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.100]   But like, he's definitely contributed
[02:35:14.100 --> 02:35:16.700]   and people enjoy his presence for sure.
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:17.660]   - Yeah, I certainly do.
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:19.820]   And I think that as you pointed out,
[02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:23.260]   he's a kind of a proxy and a template for everybody.
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:25.980]   We can relate to him because even though I've trained
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:28.420]   for many years, it's been a struggle
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:29.940]   through graduate school postdoc,
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:31.380]   made it happen one way or another,
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:32.980]   but with more or less attention
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:35.980]   and admittedly through waxing and waning levels
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:39.980]   of motivation, although I'm fortunate that I do enjoy it.
[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:41.280]   - What I think is nice about it too,
[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:45.180]   is that it's a realistic expectation that we set.
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:47.520]   I think, in other words, you're showcasing
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:49.100]   what the journey actually looks like.
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:52.220]   And he's been on the journey for, again,
[02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:54.540]   devotedly for let's say the last year and a half,
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:56.700]   but on the journey for five years.
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:59.840]   If I could make the gains that he did,
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:04.460]   starting when I started training at 14, 15,
[02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:05.860]   and you're saying, hey, by 20,
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:08.540]   you're going to have the strength levels he does,
[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:09.980]   the physique that he does,
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:11.860]   the knowledge that you've gained.
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:14.920]   That seems like a blink of an eye now, looking back.
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.380]   At 46 years old, I'm like, holy cow.
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:21.220]   I think it took me 20 years, 15, 20 years,
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:24.040]   so to just even start to get into a groove.
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:26.780]   For him to do it in a period of five years,
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:28.600]   it doesn't seem long, whereas there's people
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:30.460]   that will criticize his journey like,
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:33.040]   oh, it's just taken so long.
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.560]   There's such an instant gratification that people seek.
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:37.980]   Luckily, that's the minority.
[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:40.520]   Most people are like, this is amazing.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.660]   But I think that it becomes very uplifting
[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:45.660]   because not only is it relatable, but the journey is real,
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:48.560]   and people can appreciate that.
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:49.820]   This is what will happen if you actually
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:50.940]   put in consistent hard work.
[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:52.180]   And you'll watch him transform,
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:53.740]   go back and watch the videos.
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:55.960]   We like to oftentimes throw back to videos
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.960]   where he appeared as smaller Jesse, but also shy Jesse,
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:03.460]   arms crossed, head down,
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.980]   not making eye contact with the camera
[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:09.060]   to where now he's got his own skits and intros.
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:10.900]   It's funny because the confidence
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:13.340]   with the growth of physique came confidence too,
[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:14.380]   which is great.
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:16.780]   - Absolutely, pretty soon it'll be his world
[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:19.640]   and we'll all be living in it, as they say.
[02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:23.820]   Well, on behalf of myself and all the listeners,
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:25.940]   I really want to thank you.
[02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:27.460]   First of all, for the discussion today,
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:29.140]   I learned an immense amount.
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:30.900]   Even though I thought I knew your content well,
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:32.420]   I still learned an immense amount,
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.360]   many things we could deploy from when to stretch,
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:36.460]   how to stretch, the skipping rope.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:37.480]   We talked about nutrition.
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:40.620]   We talked about heat, cold, training regimens.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:45.020]   And what I love about all of this now that you've given us
[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:48.300]   is that there's a backbone of logic, you know,
[02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:51.300]   and some consistent themes indeed about consistency.
[02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:53.440]   But the logical backbone, I think,
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.300]   is what will enable people to really show up to the table
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:00.340]   and stay there for training consistently over time.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:03.600]   And as you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift.
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:04.980]   I can't thank you enough.
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:06.980]   I know you're an incredibly busy human being
[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:09.180]   with kids and dogs and a marriage
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:11.540]   and a thriving business. - It's my pleasure.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:12.860]   I'm happy I was able to make it work
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:15.100]   'cause I really, I've been watching your stuff for a while
[02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:17.060]   and I really, I love the science of it.
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:18.940]   I like the way you think.
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:21.380]   And it's just, you know,
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:23.180]   I'm just really fortunate that I was able to do it.
[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:25.300]   - Oh, well, I feel very gratified in hearing that
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:26.820]   and honored to have you here.
[02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:27.940]   So thank you so much.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:28.820]   - Thank you.
[02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:29.660]   - Thank you for joining me
[02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:31.400]   for my discussion with Jeff Cavaliere.
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.180]   I hope you found it as interesting
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:35.360]   and as actionable as I did.

[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:13.940]   at the beginning of today's podcast.
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:16.160]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.100]   And for those of you that are interested in supplements
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:20.180]   discussed today or on previous episodes
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:21.740]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:24.300]   again, we partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:26.480]   You can find the supplements related to this podcast
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:29.160]   at livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:31.220]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:32.060]   please do so.
[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:34.760]   We are Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:37.140]   There, I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:38.780]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:41.100]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast and other of which
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:42.880]   is distinct from the information covered
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:44.140]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:45.940]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:48.540]   and also Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:49.820]   If you're not already subscribed
[02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:52.560]   to our so-called neural network newsletter, please do so.
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.780]   You can do that by going to hubermanlab.com,
[02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:57.220]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.660]   It costs nothing to sign up or to receive the newsletters.
[02:39:59.660 --> 02:40:01.580]   They come out about once a month
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:04.300]   and they contain summaries of actionable protocols,
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:06.520]   links to relevant scientific research.
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.360]   We do not share your email with anybody
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:11.420]   and our privacy policy is made clear at that site.
[02:40:11.420 --> 02:40:13.560]   In fact, if you'd like to see some previous newsletters
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:16.180]   or download those, you can download those as PDFs
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:17.640]   without having to sign up at all.
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:19.580]   Simply by going to hubermanlab.com,
[02:40:19.580 --> 02:40:22.940]   go again into the newsletter tab under the menu
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:26.100]   and there you'll see, for instance, a toolkit for sleep
[02:40:26.100 --> 02:40:27.340]   that lists out all the things you can do
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:28.860]   to enhance your sleep.
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:32.060]   It lists out the so-called neural plasticity super protocol
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:34.740]   for enhancing learning and teaching and so on.
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:36.600]   Again, that's the neural network newsletter
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:38.180]   at hubermanlab.com.
[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:40.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.300]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:40:42.300 --> 02:40:44.880]   [upbeat music]
