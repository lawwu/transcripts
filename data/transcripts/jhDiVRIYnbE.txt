[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100]   Today on Grace To You. To be born again is a work in which you play no role and the same is true of
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.400]   new birth. The message of our Lord here is that it's a work of God which immediately obliterates
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.220]   all works righteousness. And it's important that you get this because this is how you need to
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.840]   explain to people the gospel. What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.360]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.880]   The will of God for the church in the world is to proclaim the gospel.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.560]   That is our calling.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.400]   Churches have been distracted, to put it mildly, in this current climate to get into all kinds
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.020]   of things that are not the gospel, even though they want to label them as the gospel.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.960]   The gospel is the gospel.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.840]   And this is a time for us to understand it explicitly and clearly.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.460]   We looked at the conversion of Matthew, tax collector, and we heard the words of Jesus,
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.700]   "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.860]   That is the remarkable reality of the gospel, that God saves sinners.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.120]   That when we were enemies, He set to save us.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.520]   That those people who are self-righteous and religious are, by their own self-righteousness,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   cut off from the hope of salvation.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:06.620]   We saw last week that it was the religious Pharisees who thought they knew God and were
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.600]   the representatives of God who were most strongly denounced by Jesus and who were sons of hell,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.840]   and making their disciples more sons of hell.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800]   Satan's strategy is in religion.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.840]   False religion is the satanic strategy across the world.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.640]   Any deviation from the true and pure gospel is a damning lie, but it gives the illusion
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.800]   of knowing God.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.580]   You remember in the text that we looked at in Luke, chapter 5, it ended by recalling
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.080]   the fact that there was an illustration of those who are religious being content with
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.840]   the old wine and not wanting to change to anything new.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   That was true of the Pharisees.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.360]   It was so true of the Pharisees, so true.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.240]   There were 6,000 Pharisees or so at the time of our Lord in the land of Israel.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.100]   There is only one conversion of a Pharisee in all four gospels, one.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.800]   They loved the old wine.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.840]   They loved their religion.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.680]   Jesus came to those who were...
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.180]   Irreligious, who were confronted with only their sin.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.080]   The gospel always goes to those who are not holding onto any false religion.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:46.040]   Only one Pharisee in the four gospels comes to salvation.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   I want to tell you his story.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.260]   Open your Bible to John 3, John 3.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.100]   His name will be familiar to you.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.520]   His name is Nicodemus.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.100]   That's a good name.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.960]   It means victory of the common people.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.120]   We have a responsibility as a church in doing the will of God to proclaim the gospel.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.240]   And the gospel is here articulated by Jesus as sinners needing to be born again.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.360]   The notion of being born again is so commonly expressed.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.120]   But almost no one seems to understand what our Lord is saying.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   It's a simple idea that in order to enter the kingdom, you must be born again, and you
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.360]   must understand the heavenly reality of the new birth because it is the foundational truth
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.180]   of salvation.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.160]   Nicodemus says in verse 4, "How?
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.700]   You must be born again."
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.200]   Perhaps more accurately is translated, "You must be born from above."
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.020]   Anothen .
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.960]   You must be born from above.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.800]   Let me tell you how simple the analogy is.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.520]   What role did you play in your birth, your physical birth?
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.360]   That's an absurdity.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.060]   You played no role in your physical birth.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.500]   What contribution did you make to your physical birth?
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.200]   You made no contribution to your physical birth, and that is exactly the idea in our
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.040]   Lord using this analogy.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:35.180]   To assume that you have anything to do with your physical birth is an insane idea.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.320]   To assume that you have anything to do with your spiritual birth is equally insane.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.980]   It's absurd.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:52.240]   To be born again or born from above is a work in which you play no role.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.880]   And the same is true of new birth.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.980]   The message of our Lord here is that it's a work of God, and it's totally a work of
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:11.340]   God which immediately obliterates all works righteousness, all religion, all ceremony,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:18.540]   all ritual, all sacraments as having any contribution to make to new life.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.440]   It is what theologians call monergistic.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.720]   It isn't something you make.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.820]   It's something you and God do together.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.240]   It is God alone.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.120]   You're not going to enter the kingdom of God because you try harder to be a better person,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:42.260]   or more religious, or more moral, or more philanthropic, or more virtuous.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.320]   That is exactly the point the Lord is making.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.560]   And mark it, He is making it to a man who was just introduced to us as a ruler of the
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.620]   Jews.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.260]   And down in verse 10, a man who is called the teacher of Israel.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:11.520]   This is a simple earthly analogy as to the foundation of salvation.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.860]   It is solely a work of God.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.400]   This is a dramatic, dramatic moment in the Word of God.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.460]   It is a revelation that is introduced to us in the story of Nicodemus.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.000]   Now, I want to take you through this story, and it's important that you get this because
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.240]   this is how you need to explain to people the gospel, okay?
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.860]   I'm trying to teach this to you so you can teach it to others so we can do what God has
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.800]   called us to do in the world.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.520]   It is an incredible story about the only Pharisee who is recorded to have come to Christ in
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.240]   all the four gospels.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.800]   It makes crystal clear that salvation is not for those who are good.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.500]   It's not for those who try harder.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.900]   It's not for those who live better.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.860]   It's not for those who are more moral or more religious or forsake certain vices or pray
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.920]   certain prayers.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.840]   It's all a work of God.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.960]   This is a crushing reality to legalists for sure.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.800]   But let's set it up a little bit.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.080]   Go back to chapter 2, verse 23.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:30.460]   "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast, many believed in His name,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.620]   observing His signs which He was doing.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:39.100]   But Jesus on His part was not entrusting Himself to them, for He knew all men; and because
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.260]   He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man."
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.480]   Just a small note here, by the way, Jesus is God, so He's omniscient.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.920]   Nobody has to tell Him what people are thinking because He reads their mind.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.740]   This is omniscience.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.680]   And He knew that these people who were believing in His name because they saw the signs, the
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.420]   miracles, were not expressing a saving faith.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.140]   They had faith in Him, but He had no faith in their faith.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.760]   He knew their hearts.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.860]   He knew it was superficial.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:35.240]   If you go a little further into the gospel of John, chapter 6, you get a picture of this
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.580]   same kind of faith, this false faith.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:48.680]   Verse 14, "People saw the sign which He had performed," that's the feeding of the thousands.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.600]   They said, "This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world."
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.940]   The prophet promised back in Genesis.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.940]   This is the prophet.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.680]   So they believed at least that He was the prophet.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.280]   And verse 15, "Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him before
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.120]   us to make Him a king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone."
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.640]   So there were those who thought He was the prophet, perhaps the messianic prophet, that
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.440]   thought He was the messianic king, and they wanted to thrust Him into the world.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.120]   They wanted to take Him into His reign.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.180]   They surrounded Jesus.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   They followed Him.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:40.340]   But if you go toward the end of that same sixth chapter, and you look at verse 63, "It
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:47.100]   is the Spirit who gives life," again, this is again the work of God to give spiritual
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   life, birth.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.100]   "It is the Spirit who gives life.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.280]   The flesh profits nothing.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.320]   The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life, but there are some of you who
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.560]   do not believe.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.360]   You believe, but you don't believe savingly.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.720]   For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe and who it was who
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   would betray Him."
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.000]   He had some non-believing believers following Him.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.100]   They were believing that He was perhaps the Messiah, perhaps the prophet.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.120]   And Jesus says this in verse 65, shocking.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:29.440]   "For this reason I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.360]   Him from the Father."
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.720]   Wow.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:40.940]   Your own sense about Jesus is not enough to save you.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:49.180]   No one comes to Me with saving faith unless it's been granted to Him by the Father.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.960]   That's an echo of chapter 6, verse 44.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.460]   "Unto Me, except the Father draws Him."
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.640]   Verse 66, "As a result of this, many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.420]   Him anymore."
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.340]   The false disciples left.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.080]   So Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:20.560]   Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord," there's the word, "Lord," not just prophet, not just
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.800]   Messiah.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.340]   "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.860]   You have the words of eternal life.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:33.300]   You have believed, we have believed, and have come to know that You are the Holy One of
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.160]   God."
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:45.320]   They knew that He was God, the Holy One of God, and that He had the words of eternal
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.300]   life.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.600]   They were the ones that stayed.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.300]   The rest left.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.640]   So what do you see?
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.760]   In chapter 2, verse 23, His superficial faith, and it was all around Jesus.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.260]   Eventually, they would drift away, and that's an illustration of that that we see in chapter
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.720]   6, disciples that walked no more with Him.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.360]   So at the end of chapter 2, there are these people who believe something about Jesus,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.480]   maybe that He is potentially the Messiah, the prophet, but they don't believe savingly
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.480]   in Him as Lord and the Holy One.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.820]   They believe He is the only one of God.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.460]   One of them is introduced to us in chapter 3, the man named Nicodemus.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.680]   There was a man of the Pharisees.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.100]   He's one of the group who believed, but not savingly.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.640]   He believed something about Jesus, and he's going to tell us what he believed.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.620]   He came to Jesus, and he said this in verse 2, "We know you have come from God as a teacher."
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.320]   So he believed Jesus was a teacher.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   Why?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.740]   Because no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.080]   He didn't necessarily believe that He was the Messiah.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.940]   He certainly didn't affirm that He is God, the Son.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:10.640]   He simply says, "You must have come from God as a teacher because of the signs that you
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.760]   do."
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.620]   So this is the kind of - he gives us an illustration of what it meant to believe in chapter 2,
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.160]   to believe that He was from God, a prophet, a preacher.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.580]   A teacher because of the signs that he was doing.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.260]   God must have been with him.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.660]   Now backing up to verse 1 for a moment, there was a man of the Pharisees.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.520]   Pharisees, that's a term that means separated.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.760]   They were the legalists.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.620]   They were the heart of apostate, corrupt Judaism.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.960]   To show you how corrupt they were, all you have to do is go back to chapter 2, verse
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   13.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.720]   The Passover of the Jews is near.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.000]   Jesus went to Jerusalem.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.720]   He went to the temple.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.040]   He goes into the temple, and He's right at the heart of Jewish religion.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.500]   And, of course, the Pharisees were the leaders of Jewish religion.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.920]   Even though it was the Sadducees that operated the temple, the Pharisees were the popular
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.000]   theologians of Judaism.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.720]   He goes into the temple, and He finds people selling oxen, sheep, doves, money changers
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.840]   seated at their tables.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.140]   He made a scourge of cords, drove them all out of the temple with the sheep and the oxen,
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.840]   and poured out the coins of the money changers, overturned their tables, and to those who
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.440]   were selling the doves, He said, "Take these things away.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   Stop making My Father's house a place of business."
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.540]   His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume Me."
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:41.140]   Jesus went in and wiped out their corrupt operations.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.060]   Pharisees were a part of that.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.460]   They were corrupt.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.680]   In fact, we're told they were lovers of God.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.100]   They were lovers of money.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.820]   They were the Supreme Court of Israel.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:05.340]   They were wealthy, rich scholars, elite, from prominent families, ex-high priests who made
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.600]   up the Jewish court.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.760]   Nicodemus was one of them.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.440]   So he was at the top of the theological pyramid as a Pharisee, and he was at the top of the
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.520]   structure of Judaistic authority by being a member of the Supreme Court.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:31.680]   There just is not much hope that a man so situated in life, so happy with the old wine,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:39.640]   is going to show any interest in Jesus, and that is why this story is so unique.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.140]   He said to him, "Rabbi," - this is good, by the way, "Rabbi," - recognize him as a
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:50.360]   teacher - "we know you've come from God as a teacher because of the signs they've put
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.540]   forth that you do."
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.200]   He came.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.160]   He was curious.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.060]   He was interested.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.560]   Rabbi is very respectful.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.020]   The signs, he recognizes that they have to be done by God.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.440]   There is no other explanation for them.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.680]   God has to be with him.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.220]   He agreed with many others that there were no possible human explanations for the miracles
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.740]   Jesus did.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.200]   He is not alone.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.300]   Because he says, "We know that you have come from God," because he's a part of the group
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.100]   from chapter 2 that believed at some point to some degree.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.480]   So here, first of all, his objective, plural, first-person, eyewitness testimony to the
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:42.760]   authenticity of the miracles of Jesus as proof of his divine mission.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:48.420]   And Nicodemus recognizes that, and he is polite, and he is respectful, and I imagine there's
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.040]   a certain amount of excitement in his words.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.560]   He's a professional religionist.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.500]   He's a money-loving theologian.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:05.740]   He's a justice in the supreme court of Israel.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.420]   He is at the top of everything.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.760]   And, by the way, some of the theology of the Pharisees was accurate.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.140]   They believed in divine decree.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.480]   They believed in moral accountability.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.940]   They believed in immortality.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.640]   They believed in bodily resurrection.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.880]   They believed in angels.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.940]   They actually believed in punishment and rewards in the future.
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:34.460]   But they thought that they attained to the kingdom of God by law-keeping, ritual observance.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:43.740]   And since they never saw a change in their hearts, they pretended to be holy.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:49.120]   This is Nicodemus, and he did take the road less traveled, only 6,000 of them, and he
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:49.720]   lived.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.

[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.

[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.

[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   He lived a life of the Lord.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.340]   God is King.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.120]   Psalm 93:1 says, "The Lord reigns."
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.080]   He reigns over the universe, the universal King.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.440]   He reigns over the realm of salvation.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:59.680]   He reigns over the millennial kingdom to come in the future, and He will reign eternally.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.320]   What Nicodemus wanted in his heart was to be in the kingdom, which is to be accepted
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.140]   by God, to have the hope of eternal life.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.720]   He wanted to be in the realm of the redeemed, those who are saved from judgment.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.500]   He wanted to be in relationship with God forever and bound for heaven.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.800]   Jesus' answer is stunning.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:29.280]   Verse 3, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he cannot see the
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.840]   kingdom of God."
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.360]   That is to say, religion is totally ineffective.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.560]   Judaism is ineffective even at its highest level.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:47.240]   And Jesus' words shatter once and for all every supposed hope in religion.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:55.960]   All of religion combined at its highest level is a zero before God.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.020]   All of it is useless.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.980]   To be in the kingdom, you have to be born from above.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.980]   If you're doing evangelism, one of the things you want to convince the unconvinced is to
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.980]   be a sinner.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.980]   If you're a sinner, you want to be a savior.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.980]   You want to be a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.980]   You have to be a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   That is the first step.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.980]   And the second step, the first step, is to be a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.980]   The first step, the first step, the first step, is to be a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.980]   The first step, the first step, is to be a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.080]   The fast track to realizing you're a sinner is to wind up in prison.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.600]   Ministering to those incarcerated is nothing new to Grace2U.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.020]   It's thrilling to be able to give the hope of the gospel to these men.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.320]   They are at the lowest point of their life in every possible sense.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   And they're also interacting with the reality of their own sinfulness because they're there
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   because of sin.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:44.520]   The biggest, toughest, most tattooed, hardest looking guys you've ever seen, they come in.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.560]   Sometimes the weight of their sin, sometimes it's just the circumstances that they find
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   themselves in.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.360]   I mean, in LA County alone, in the LA County jail system, the statistics say it's on average
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.200]   about 22,000 men and women who are incarcerated on a daily basis.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.800]   You know, that's like a small city.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.980]   I mean, every day I'm talking to men who are broken.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.980]   So at 14, I started to use different drugs.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:20.740]   I grew up to two parents who were heavily involved in gangs and that was my lifestyle
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   for a very long time.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:28.440]   It led me down a dark path and I ended up homeless, which is in Los Angeles, and still
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.600]   addicted to drugs and unable to get clean.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.980]   I was stealing from a store and got booked on a robbery.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980]   It all started when I was 18.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.980]   I was a kid.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.480]   I was around eight years old.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.220]   And it was from there where I went from bad to worse.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.860]   And fast forwarding to when I was 11, I went to jail for the first time.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.040]   Yeah, you pretty much sit there.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   It's like the bus stop.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.980]   You just wait for your to be shipped out to the next location and you just got all day
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   to sit there and look at yourself.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.980]   I always remember going into the cell and I would always see a Bible there.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.980]   There was always a Bible there.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:07.980]   I was to the point where I would make fun of Christians.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.980]   So I was like outspoken against God.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.980]   Looking back and just throughout the whole time throughout my life and how important
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.980]   it is for sound doctrine to be reached to these men and it's vital.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.980]   It's a prime opportunity for the gospel to go forth and for the people to self-reflect,
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.980]   I think.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.980]   I think there's a lot of good things that we can do.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   I think there's a lot of good things that we can do.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.980]   I think that the Bible is the best thing that we can do.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   It's the best thing that we can do.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   And that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.980]   And I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.980]   And I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   I think that's what I'm going to do.
