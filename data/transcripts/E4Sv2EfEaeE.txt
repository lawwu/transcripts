[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.080]   This week we're talking about pastoral ministry.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.640]   Can single men pastor?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.200]   That's today.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.160]   Or must pastors be married?
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.720]   And then how much should pastors make?
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720]   That's up next time.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.280]   So, Pastor John, we know that many professing Christians around the world claim that church
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.800]   leaders must be single men who have taken a vow of clerical celibacy.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.680]   We of course disagree with that.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.960]   For Protestants like us, pastors are typically married men.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.880]   Typically married men.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.960]   So we face a question in the opposite direction, and it's a question recently asked by two
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.200]   different listeners.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   First Josiah.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.420]   Pastor John, thank you for sharing your insight with us week after week on this podcast.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.320]   Do you believe a first requirement for eldership is that he have a wife and kids?
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.360]   And then Josiah cites 1 Timothy 3, verses 2 to 4, and Titus 1, 6.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.600]   And Blake, another listener, likewise asks, "If a single non-married man is eligible
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.440]   to be a church elder, what would you say to Josiah and Blake?"
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   Whether a single man is permitted biblically to be an elder or pastor boils down to whether
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:31.160]   two passages, one in 1 Timothy 3, the other in Titus 1, mandate that elders must be married.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.500]   If they do, that settles the matter.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.080]   We obey.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.940]   If they don't, then we have to ask whether there are other passages or other pointers
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.920]   or principles that would suggest it's permitted or wise or unwise to have pastors who are
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.700]   not married.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.240]   So here are those two most immediately relevant texts.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.720]   First Timothy 3, verse 4.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   "He must manage his own household well," so he's given qualifications for the overseers.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.040]   "He must manage his own household well with all dignity, keeping his children submissive,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.800]   for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   church?"
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.640]   The other one is Titus, chapter 1, verse 5.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   "This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained in order and appoint
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.520]   elders in every town, as I directed you, if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   wife."
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.680]   A couple of observations are, I think, especially relevant.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:56.100]   Paul does not say here or anywhere else, "Elders must be married."
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.120]   He could have said that very clearly.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.240]   It would have been easy in Greek to say that.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   It would have been easy, of course, in English to say that.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.840]   For example, Titus 1.7 says, "An overseer as God's steward must be above reproach,"
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.800]   and the Greek "dei," "must," has to be, is necessary, makes it an explicit necessity.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.360]   No questions.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.960]   Paul could have said, "An overseer must be married," but he didn't say that.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:40.200]   What he said was, first, "The elder must manage his household well," and two, "If
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   he's a husband of one wife, he can be considered."
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:53.680]   Neither of those statements amount to an explicit mandate for marriage, so it appears that marriage
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.320]   was assumed, but that it was not explicitly commanded.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   I expect that it was assumed because ongoing lifelong singleness in that culture, those
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.400]   cultures, was so rare that it scarcely needed addressing.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.560]   That's the first observation.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.080]   Another observation is the assumption that the elder would not only normally be married,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.560]   but that he would normally have children.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   Both passages assume that the elders have wives and have children, so if we're going
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.640]   to infer that marriage is required for the pastorate on the same grounds, it seems to
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:54.680]   me, we would need to infer that a pastor have children, not just a wife.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   So if I'm right that in these texts there is a strong assumption that a man will be
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.240]   married with a family if he's a pastor, and yet there's no explicit command that
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.760]   he be married or have children, then my question becomes, what other considerations in the
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.280]   New Testament might help us decide whether it's wise to have a pastor who's not
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.040]   married or expect that he would be or require that he would be?
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:35.440]   Now, the first consideration we might look at is that neither Jesus nor Paul was married
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.000]   and yet fulfilled roles of leadership and teaching and care for the churches in very
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.560]   much like a pastor.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.440]   Nothing is ever said about Jesus being married or single.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.800]   The topic of his own marriage never comes up.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.700]   There is no wife in the story of the Gospels, and it would be a total fantasy—some people
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.520]   have spun out that fantasy—a total fantasy to claim that he was married.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   Paul, on the other hand, tells us more than once that he was not married.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:20.640]   For example, in 1 Corinthians 9, 5, "Do we," meaning Barnabas and him, "Do we
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.880]   not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.560]   of the Lord and Cephas?"
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.900]   In other words, they certainly do have the right, and yet there are practical reasons
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.400]   why marriage for Paul would have been unwise.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.680]   He didn't use his right.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:50.440]   The call on his life was just constant movement, and a lot of it in jail, enduring almost constant
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.980]   suffering.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.520]   So marriage would probably have been constantly dangerous and miserable for a wife, whatever
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   the reason.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.160]   He wasn't, and he makes it explicit in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 6, "I wish that all
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.500]   were as I myself, but each has his own gift from God, one kind, one of another.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.920]   To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.540]   am."
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:32.180]   So it seems to me that the singleness of Jesus and the singleness of Paul implies that an
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:41.660]   unmarried man can have an exceptionally fruitful ministry and be an effective pastor.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:50.420]   And add to this the amazing praise that Paul sings to the benefits of singleness.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:58.880]   Here's what he says in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 32 to 35, "I want you to be free from anxieties.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.140]   The unmarried man is anxious about many things of the Lord, how to please the Lord, but the
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.780]   married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, and his interests
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.620]   are divided.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.880]   And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about things of the Lord and how to be holy
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.980]   in body and spirit, but the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.660]   her husband.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.460]   I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.820]   order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord."
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.740]   And we're tempted to say, "Well, Paul, why don't you just make singleness a requirement
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.740]   for the pastor?"
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.020]   I mean, the church went off the rails at one point and did that.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:09:04.580]   And Paul would say, I think, in response to that question, number one, sexual desire is
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:12.860]   intended ordinarily to be satisfied in marriage, and that goes for pastors too.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.860]   Verse five verses of chapter seven of 1 Corinthians, amazing verses.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.940]   Number two, while there are advantages to singleness in the pastorate, there are great
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:30.540]   advantages also to marriage in the pastorate, not only in the matter of sex, but also in
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.020]   the matter of firsthand knowledge about marriage and parenting and stresses and joys of ordinary
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.820]   family life.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:44.020]   All of that is a great benefit for pastors, and having a wife at your side, oh my goodness,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.940]   is a great ministerial blessing, I testify.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:57.780]   So when Paul is singing the praises of singleness, he's not singing them as though there were
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.780]   no corresponding praises for marriage, especially in the pastorate.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:12.260]   So my conclusion is that the reason Paul assumed marriage for the pastoral role in 1 Timothy
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:19.860]   and Titus was that it was culturally normal and it was a great advantage in knowing how
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:30.140]   to manage a household and empathize with married people in the church, and that was the norm.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.300]   Most people were married.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:42.220]   But also I conclude that marriage is not an absolute requirement for the eldership or
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:49.140]   pastorate and that along the lines of 1 Corinthians 7, there are advantages of being single in
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.620]   that role.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:59.220]   So if I were on a search committee for the next pastor of our church, I would assume
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:07.500]   we're looking for a married man who has a family, but I would not rule out a gifted
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.380]   single man whose life and ministry had shown and borne real fruit.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.060]   Thank you for walking us through your own thinking here, Pastor John, and through these
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060]   texts.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.060]   It's a wonderful question, Josiah and Blake.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.500]   Thank you for sending them.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.020]   And if you want to ask Pastor John, email us your question.

[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:36.260]   Well, next up, another question about pastoring, married or single, how much should a pastor make?
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.820]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.780]   We'll see you back here on Thursday for that.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.780]   [END]
