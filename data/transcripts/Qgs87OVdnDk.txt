[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 173.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.280]   I'm here in the Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.960]   Jesse, I've been hearing feedback that these core idea segments that we're doing, people
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960]   like them.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   Yeah, we just got them published on YouTube today, so they can listen on the podcast and
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.080]   they can listen to it on YouTube as well.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.280]   I think the factor on YouTube now is a big deal.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   So for people who don't know, the core idea segments, we've been doing these in recent
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   episodes.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   It's where I do a deep dive on one of the basic core ideas I come back to again and
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.680]   again.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.160]   I forget how used to I am with some of these notions, because I've been writing about them
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.960]   and talking about them for, in some cases, decades.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.800]   But I forget that not everyone is so familiar.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.040]   So we're going through and taking some of the core ideas and let's just walk through
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   it from scratch.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.760]   Now these segments are beginning to appear on YouTube.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.160]   You can actually now go back and reference a particular core idea segment without having
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.240]   to find the podcast episode in which I talk about it and fast forward to the part where
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.440]   I talked about it.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.400]   So I believe as of the day we're recording this episode, you can find on YouTube, the
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   core idea segment on time management, on slow productivity, and on my thoughts around passion
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.060]   and career satisfaction.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.080]   Going forward as you hear new core idea segments, those will go online pretty soon afterwards.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080]   What do we think, Jesse?
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.720]   Usually a couple of days after the episode airs?
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   Yeah, be quick.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.720]   A couple of days.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   And they're in their own playlist.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.160]   We'll put them in their own playlist so they will be easy to find.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.800]   Now I'm going to do a new core idea segment to start today's episode.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.160]   But first, first I want to do a quick plug and I will explain why I'm doing this plug
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.000]   here in a second because it's relevant to the show.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.440]   But the plug is for my long time friend from when I was growing up in Pennington, New Jersey,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.960]   Jamie Kilstein.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.920]   He is doing a going away comedy show in Austin on February 24th at Creek and Cave, which
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   is a cool venue.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.320]   So Jamie Kilstein, February 24th is doing a comedy show Creek and Cave.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   Go to creekandcave.com to reserve tickets.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.960]   A really talented, funny guy.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.300]   He dropped out of high school to start doing comedy full time.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.400]   And I've seen him off and on doing shows throughout his career.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   Real talent.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.800]   So a little back story about why I'm talking about this on the show.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   Jamie has an interesting but also pretty complicated and tumultuous life story.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.720]   As I mentioned, he dropped out of high school, started doing comedy full time in New York
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.960]   as a teenager, ended up starting one of the very first political podcasts.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.280]   And then that got really big and that blew up.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.400]   He got tied up in scandals and had ups and downs.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.920]   He would come back to comedy because he had a real natural talent there and then would
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.540]   go back underground, struggled with mental health issues.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.800]   In all of this complicated storyline, social media began to play an increasingly negative
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.460]   role in his life.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.640]   So we recorded this two-part podcast episode.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   And the first part we recorded in December.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.200]   And Jamie just lays out, here's my life story and the struggles I'm going through.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.560]   And then I gave him Dr. Phil style some advice.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.520]   Here's what I want you to do about social media in your life.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.200]   And then we came back 30 days later and recorded a follow-up podcast where he reported back,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   this is what happened.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.600]   And the idea here is Jesse and I are going to edit these two things together because
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.240]   I think it presents a really interesting nuanced portrayal of the benefits and the extreme
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520]   harms of social media.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   And this is a complicated person.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.600]   So this is not just some simple story of here's like this great guy and everything was going
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.120]   well and then social media made it bad.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's a real story.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   It's gritty.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   But you also see in real time what it's like to try to disentangle your life.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   So we're working on this cool episode, but it requires a lot of editing and we're not
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   great at that.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.500]   We don't have our act together.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.600]   In that episode, we were promoting this going away show.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.760]   And so we did not get the episode live in time for this promotion.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.000]   So I'm just giving the promotion now.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.380]   And you don't know what going away means or why it's important because we haven't played
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.380]   the episode yet.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.060]   But I can tell you if you're in Austin, Jamie is someone you shouldn't miss February 24th,
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.940]   Creek and Cave and stay tuned for that interesting, complicated Dr. Phil slash intervention slash
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.740]   reminiscing about Cal's childhood episode that is coming soon.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.380]   All right.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.260]   So let's get on to the meat of our business today, which is our next core idea segment.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:05.020]   I thought I would tackle the topic for which I am probably best known, which is deep work.
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.520]   So I'm known for deep work because of the book I published in 2016 of that same name.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.380]   This was a book that had a bit of a quiet launch.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.060]   It was a Wall Street Journal bestseller for a week or so.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.740]   And that was just off of the strength of my email list audience at that time.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.860]   And then it sort of went under the radar.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.860]   And then a year or so later, something just started to happen.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.060]   People kept buying it and they started buying it at a higher rate than they did before.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.880]   And it's a book that never actually had a week in which it was gangbusters.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.300]   It never had a week in which it was number two on the charts on Amazon.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.700]   It never had a Mark Manson or James Clear moment.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.180]   But this book has quietly moved into almost 40 languages.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.080]   Now you can get this book in a lot of places.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.540]   There is a Mongolian version of this book.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.940]   We have a book being sold.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.140]   There's a French speaking Africa version of the book.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.400]   It's a lot of places.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.220]   It's also quietly sold in English more than a million units.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.220]   It's out there.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   It's had an impact, but never loudly.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.500]   It's a little background.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.180]   So let's talk about deep work.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.260]   Let's talk about it.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.360]   Three things, three things to cover here.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.820]   Number one, what is it?
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.520]   Number two, why is it important?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.180]   Number three, how do you do it better?
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.060]   Those are the three key points if we're going to talk about deep work.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.420]   So number one, what is deep work?
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.260]   It is an activity.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.100]   People often explode or expand this definition to cover all sorts of different things, entire
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.400]   lifestyles, whole value judgment systems about what work is important and what's not.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.600]   Deep work is none of those things.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.180]   It is a humble description for a very specific activity.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.940]   It is when you are focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.380]   If you are doing that activity, you are doing deep work.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.020]   Now let's unfold those two parts.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   The easy part of that is cognitively demanding.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.340]   So you're working on something hard and you're thinking hard about it.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.660]   There's a hard thing and you're thinking hard about it.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.860]   That's the easy part of the definition.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.260]   The more demanding part of the definition is that you're doing this without distraction.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.300]   Now what I mean by that more technically is that you are doing this cognitively demanding
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.100]   work in the absence of context shifts.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.940]   Context shift is when you turn the focus of your attention from one cognitive context
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.840]   to another for a session to count as deep work.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.620]   You cannot be doing those switches.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.420]   So if you're working on something non-cognitively demanding, let's say you're trying to format
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.740]   properly a chart in PowerPoint.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.860]   That's not cognitively demanding.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.860]   That's not deep work.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.860]   But let's say you are doing something cognitively demanding.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.220]   You are trying to write a strategy memo.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.220]   It's hard.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220]   You got to think about this.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   Like, what are we trying to say here?
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.500]   I have to say this just right.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.900]   But let's say while you're writing the strategy memo, every five to six minutes, you quick
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.860]   check your email inbox.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.380]   You glance at your phone to see what's going on.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.660]   That session also does not count as deep work because you are doing these context shifts,
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.260]   which significantly degrades your cognitive effectiveness.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.300]   So if you can avoid the shifts, you're working on something hard, you are doing deep work.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.940]   Otherwise, you're either doing shallow work, which is work that's not cognitively demanding,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.020]   or you're doing pseudo deep work, which is you're working on something hard, but you
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.380]   keep switching context.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:38.300]   So you are at a fraction of your capability of producing clean thought.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.620]   So that's all deep work is a particular type of activity, among many types of activities
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.840]   you might do during a typical workday.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.020]   Number two, why is it important?
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:57.020]   Well, I first want to make make clear that there's not a moral hierarchy here.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.980]   There's not an argument that the only type of work that matters is deep work.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.740]   We know in almost any professional context, there's lots of other types of efforts that
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.260]   are critical for those efforts.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.140]   If you are not properly invoicing your clients, which is not a deep activity, but if you are
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.040]   not properly invoicing your clients, you're going to get no money and your business is
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.220]   going to go out of business.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.000]   A couple years ago, I was to give another example, the director of graduate studies
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.980]   for the computer science department here at Georgetown and something we had to do each
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.860]   spring as part of that role is build a budget that talked about for every doctoral student
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.260]   we have, where is the money coming from for the tuition, for the research assistantship,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.840]   for the TA ship, for the health insurance, we had to work out this budget.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.820]   And there was nothing about that this that was deep, it wasn't cognitively demanding,
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.340]   it was just a huge pain because as you can imagine, it's complicated to untangle this
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.340]   is coming from a grant and this is coming from a fellowship and this is coming from
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.780]   a, from the department funds, but you know what critically important work without it,
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.300]   the students don't get paid and they can't do what they're trying to do.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.740]   So deep work is not from a moral standpoint, the only work that matters, but in many professional
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.580]   contexts, and this was the core concept for my book, deep work, it is the deep efforts
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.380]   that move the needle.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.940]   Ultimately, the activity that produces the value that allows you to keep doing what you're
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.300]   doing, that allows you to get promoted in what you're doing, that allows your company
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.180]   to grow or be more successful.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.820]   Typically, these core activities are going to have a foundation of deep work.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.140]   So it's what moves the needle.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.860]   This is particularly clear in knowledge work, work where you're sitting at a computer screen
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.780]   all day.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.540]   No one's going to pay your company for how quickly you answer emails, no one's going
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.500]   to pay your company because you are really rocking zoom meeting after zoom meeting, no
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.700]   one's going to pay you or give money to your company because you're jumping on calls, no
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.460]   one's going to pay you or your company, because you're shooting around PowerPoint decks with
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.140]   rapid speed, what are they going to pay your company for in a knowledge where context adding
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.660]   value to information, this is almost always a effort of deep work, skilled thought on
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.140]   something if it was not skilled thought or difficult, it would be easily replicatable
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.540]   and his value would plummet.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.660]   You run the ad agency, there's a lot of stuff you have to do to keep the lights on, but
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.140]   it's coming up with the really good ad campaigns that gets you paid.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.260]   You run the tech company, there's a lot you have to do to make sure that the code is released
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.180]   properly and marketed, but if you're not writing fantastic code, it gives you a good stable
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.780]   product, you're out of business.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.500]   There's a lot that goes into marketing books.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.220]   But if you're not writing fantastic book, it doesn't matter how much of that you're
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.740]   doing.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.740]   So in knowledge work, shallow efforts keep the lights on deep work moves the needle,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.380]   it's important that the core of what creates value.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.380]   In other types of industries, this is even more clear.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.020]   If you're an athlete, it's all about the deep efforts, the deep training and the deep
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.020]   performance.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.660]   Training is a matter of deep work, focused incredibly intensely on what you're trying
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   to do.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.380]   Performing, you're on the court, you're on the field, incredibly deep, focused effort,
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.580]   no distractions.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.620]   So deep work is clearly what moves the needle there.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:19.500]   See this in art, you see this in the skilled crafts, if I'm a elite woodworker, ultimately
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.780]   what matters more than anything else in my producing beautifully made, very well constructed
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.780]   artifacts.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.020]   So deep work is often what moves the needle.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.940]   Not the only effort that matters, but it's what often moves the needle.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:35.500]   The issue we got into, and this was the premise of the book, Deep Work, the issue we have
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.580]   gotten into more recently is that we forgot that.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.500]   We began to think about all work being work, it's all equal.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.620]   Either you're doing stuff or you're not.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.620]   And if you're doing stuff and working hard, that's good.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.000]   And if you're not doing stuff and working hard, that's bad.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.200]   We stopped differentiating between deep work and shallow work.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.060]   So why was this a problem? because we had developments in the digital world.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.660]   Tools like low friction communication channels, email, slack, we got highly distracting entertainment
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.220]   like YouTube and social media pulling out our attention from the phones.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.060]   We got zoom and PowerPoint slides and jumping on calls and our work got more ambiguous,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.500]   it became less clear exactly what it is that we do.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.060]   And in this context, we fell into this mode where increasingly you could go through most
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.040]   of your day never actually concentrating hard without distraction.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.400]   Most of your day is now on calls in emails on zoom, changing those proverbial fonts and
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.860]   trying to get that chart to work in your PowerPoint slides.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.340]   And we all patted ourselves on the back and said, look how busy we are.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.940]   We're crushing it, we're getting after it.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.380]   But we forgot that we weren't doing the actual underlying core deep work activities that
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.940]   was going to allow this company to keep existing in the first place.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.380]   It's going to allow you to continue to keep your job in the first place.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:52.420]   We were on the deck of the Titanic, sending Instagram pictures of our deck chair arrangements,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.660]   not even realizing that the ship underneath us was sinking.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.180]   And so the core argument in the book is that is a problem.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.540]   But it's also an opportunity.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.980]   Because what we have is a situation where this really important thing is becoming more
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.980]   scarce.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.540]   So guess what, if you are one of the few people to prioritize it, if you're one of the few
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:19.140]   organizations to prioritize it, you are going to get a disproportionate competitive advantage.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:25.220]   If you prioritize depth in an increasingly shallow world, there is large reward that
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.900]   you are going to get.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.020]   So we could see it as a negative, we are forgetting about deep work as we drown in the shallow,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.740]   or you can see it as a positive, everyone else is doing that.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.420]   But I don't.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.020]   I am getting wildly and disproportionately rewarded for that.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.140]   Because you know the old saying, you don't have to be faster than a bear.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.140]   When you run into that grizzly in the park, you just have to be faster than the person
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.180]   who's there with you.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.300]   Bear will get him first.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.460]   So that's why deep work is important.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.940]   So what we need is to make sure that it's something that we prioritize.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:04.820]   And it has a good presence, an intentional presence in our working life.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.500]   Alright, so the third idea here is, how do we do that?
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.620]   How do we do deep work better?
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.460]   Well that's most of my book.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.660]   I have a keynote I've been giving for a long time where I spend 30 minutes going through
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.820]   examples about this.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.980]   It's an endlessly rich topic.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.220]   So let me just give you a sampling of some ideas here about what matters, if you want
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.060]   to take advantage of this reality that deep work is valuable, but becoming more scarce.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.860]   One just defining it is critical.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:37.100]   The fact that we have terminology is at the core of any change.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.060]   Just knowing deep work is different than shallow work allows you to actually say, Oh, I see
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.300]   what we're trying to do here.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.380]   Otherwise, the only knob you have to turn is work harder or not.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.440]   Stay up later, be on your phone more.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.900]   As soon as the plane lands, whip it out, do those emails.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.700]   If you don't know what it is you're trying to do better, you're not going to actually
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   do the right things better.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.700]   So defining it is key.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.060]   Two, you need to measure it and you need to have goals.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.300]   One of the most important ideas from that book, I believe was the deep to shallow work
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.660]   ratio.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:14.900]   The concept is you figure out for your particular position, what is the ideal ratio of deep
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:21.980]   work hours to non deep work hours in a standard work week?
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.860]   This will differ depending on your job, but you should know what the right answer is.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.180]   If you work for someone else, you should have this conversation with the person you work
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.660]   for with your supervisor.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   Here's what deep work is.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.660]   Here's what shallow work is.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.660]   Both is important.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.740]   We have to get the invoices out the door.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.100]   But if I'm not producing good ad copy, we're not going to get any more money.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.380]   What is the ratio in my job that I should do that will best serve this company and you
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.780]   get a number and then you measure and if you already time block plan, you can just look
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.900]   straight on your time block plan for the week and see all the blocks that you've marked
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.980]   off as deep work blocks.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.540]   It's easy to actually get these numbers, but you measure and you say, Hey, here's how we're
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.660]   doing.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.260]   You and I talked about this and said it should be 50 50.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.260]   Guess what?
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.020]   I got two hours of deep work in last week.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:12.940]   Remember it does not count as deep work if it is not hard and if it's not with zero distraction.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.020]   Now you're confronting a clear number.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.220]   We decided 50 50 would best serve this company.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.340]   We're nowhere near 50 50.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.500]   We either have to say, you know what, Cal?
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.140]   I don't want you to do any deep work, which is crazy because again, that's what creates
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.140]   the value.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.340]   Or you say, we're gonna have to make some changes and then you get changes to the company
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.940]   culture.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.380]   Then you get more flexibility or workload changes.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.880]   It is a driver for change that comes from a place of positivity.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.100]   If you work for yourself, do the same exercise.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.100]   Here's the ratio.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.100]   I'm going to hold myself to it.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.420]   If I'm not hitting it, something has to change.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.220]   Schedule your deep work time is another big one that's very important.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.880]   Do not wait for the instinct to hit you.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.580]   You know, I'm just in the mood to do some deep work and I have nothing to do.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.580]   That's never going to happen.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.060]   If that happens, you're not working hard enough.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.380]   That's not something that's going to arise naturally.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.060]   So you need to get it on your calendar one way or the other and treat it like you would
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.460]   any other meeting or appointment.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.740]   That's time that is protected.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.660]   That's time that you cannot overschedule.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.420]   Have a philosophy for how you do this.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.860]   Maybe it's the same time on the same days every week.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.300]   Maybe instead when you do your weekly plan, it's more bespoke.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.540]   Here's where I'm going to fit it in this week.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.140]   Maybe you take one day a week where you do just deep work and the other days you don't.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.460]   However you want to do it, but have a philosophy, schedule it, protect it, and if possible,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.620]   have rituals surrounding these actual sessions that really helps your mind slip into the
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.620]   deep work mode.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.820]   I do the same walk.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.140]   I go to the same secondary office space.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.200]   I make the very same cup of coffee in the same cup.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.740]   Have a ritual so your brain knows, oh, it's time to do deep work.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.080]   Maybe you have to train this ability concentration is hard.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.480]   If you look at your phone and every single piece of downtime you have, you are out of
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.740]   cognitive shape.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.620]   You're a cognitive slob.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.260]   If you give yourself a two-hour window and say, "Let's go do some deep work," that's
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.840]   like taking the guy who is in terrible shape and be like, "Look, man, we're going to run
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   some stadiums."
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.620]   It's not going to go well.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.620]   You are going to be distracted.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.140]   It's going to be difficult.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.500]   You are going to literally be sweating.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.140]   You're like, "This is terrible."
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.580]   That's because you haven't trained.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.720]   Don't give up if it's hard.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.700]   That just means you haven't been on your virtual Peloton yet long enough to get those virtual
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.760]   lungs back in shape here.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.540]   You have to train, which means you have to spend time free from distractions on a regular
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.340]   basis, read books because that forces your mind to concentrate, do productive meditation
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.140]   where you try to work on a professional problem just in your head as you walk.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.020]   That is fantastic training.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.700]   Board games, any type of strategy game where you have to think hard about it.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.380]   Do all these type of things.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.900]   Complicated hobbies that require real focus and skill, be it manual or physical.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.380]   You have to get your mind in shape if you're going to succeed at deep work.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.860]   It's not enough just to say, "I'm going to do it."
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.860]   You got to train for it.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.780]   All right, so those are the main three ideas about deep work, what it is, why it's important,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.460]   and how to get better at it.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.500]   I'm going to add a coda here that I think is also critically important, which is once
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:24.260]   you are doing these things, you have to work the word deep into your everyday conversation
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.360]   as a prefix and adjective absolutely as much as possible.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.940]   That's how people know you're awesome, and people are going to think you're really cool
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.940]   if you do it.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.980]   That's my final piece of advice.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.580]   You need to just walk in and be like, "Hey, guys, deep Monday, am I right?
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.700]   Yeah, I'm just going to get a deep coffee break over there.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.700]   Now you're doing a little deep urination.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.860]   All right, good work with that.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   You come back.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.860]   We'll deep it up.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.860]   Stay deep.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.860]   Let's deep on over to the deep conference room, man.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.260]   We're going to go deep on these type of things.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.300]   This is going to make you sound awesome, and people are going to love you."
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:21:05.380]   Jesse here will attest, "Every time I see him, we fist bump and say, 'Deeple Meeple.'"
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.380]   You can attest to that.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.180]   Just see each other in the street, "Deeple Meeple."
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.180]   Let it explode.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.340]   If you're going to do all this work, you got to let people know.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.820]   It'll make you ... Trust me.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.220]   I know from personal experience, people love it when you use the word deep all the time,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.220]   and they think you're awesome.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.220]   Let's throw that in there.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.660]   All right, guys, that's it.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.180]   Core idea, work deeply, deeple meeple.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:33.700]   All right, Jesse, we got a lot of good questions here, but we should probably pay the bills
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.740]   if we're going to deep up this episode.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.180]   We got to do some deep ad reads.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.780]   We're going to get deep on these.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.820]   Make sure the listeners use the promo code "deep."
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.420]   Yeah, it's promo code.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   You got promo code "deep" for these ads.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.420]   Deeple meeple.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.900]   All right, so we got a couple sponsors here I want to talk about.
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.820]   The first one is My Body Tutor.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.820]   Adam Gilbert, who founded My Body Tutor, I've known for a very long time.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.260]   Long time readers of my blog, Study Hacks, would remember that Adam was actually the
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:14.260]   fitness advice guru in 2007, if you can believe it, on Study Hacks.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.340]   I would ask him questions about how to get in better shape and nutrition, especially
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.580]   for students, and he was our guru, so I've known him for a long time.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.180]   He founded this company, My Body Tutor, which is brilliant.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:32.180]   It's 100% online fitness and health coaching.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:39.020]   You have a coach who's assigned to you, and you check in with this coach virtually.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.020]   Here's what I did today.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.020]   Here's what's going on with my exercise.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.660]   Here's what I'm doing with my eating, and you get daily feedback from that coach.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.140]   The whole thing is virtual, but because it's virtual, you can actually get daily back and
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.860]   forth feedback with your coach, which is what you need when it comes to major changes in
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   health and fitness.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.140]   The issue is not information.
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:02.660]   The issue is consistency, actually doing the work, having someone on the other side there
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:08.100]   who you know, who you've been working with week after week, who's on the journey with
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.900]   you, who is custom building your plan for getting where you specifically want to get.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.100]   There's no better way to do this.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.780]   I know My Body Tutor has been doing great.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.460]   It did great during the pandemic because obviously virtual coaching made a big difference, and
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.500]   it's just a brilliant idea.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.220]   I highly recommend it.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:33.380]   If you are serious about getting fit, go to mybodytutor.com.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:39.380]   That's mybodytutor.com.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:45.180]   Mention that you came from Deep Questions, and Adam will give you $50 off your first
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.180]   month.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.220]   That's mybodytutor.com.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.540]   Mention Deep Questions and get $50 off your first month.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.180]   I want to talk about another sponsor here, Athletic Greens.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.620]   Jesse, you can attest, I talk about this.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.080]   I take Athletic Greens daily.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.900]   This is actually the one type of supplement that I actually take.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.900]   So I've been, I bother Jesse about these things because he knows about health and fitness
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.300]   things.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   Here's what it is.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:20.340]   It's a powder that you take with water, 12 ounces of water each morning, and that's it.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.160]   Every morning I take this powder.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.300]   It has 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, whole foods, sourced superfoods, probiotics,
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.580]   and adaptogens.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.420]   But the big thing is you don't have to worry about, "Am I getting the right mineral for
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.420]   my food?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.620]   Do I have the right vitamin that has this thing I need?"
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.880]   You just take the Athletic Greens and trust them.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.820]   This is why, let me tell you personally why I landed on the Athletic Greens bandwagon.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.340]   It's because I talked to someone from the company, had a good conversation with them
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.900]   when I was thinking about letting them be a sponsor.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.740]   And here's what they explained to me that caught my attention.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.900]   This is the only thing they do.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.060]   They don't have a big line of, "Here's our shakes and here's this type of pill and that
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   type of pill."
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.260]   Athletic Greens does one thing.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.540]   It makes this powder and they think of it as a product that they upgrade every single
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.540]   year.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.780]   So they're just obsessed with, "How do we get the very best versions of these vitamins,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.500]   of these minerals, of whatever it is that's in there?
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.060]   How do we upgrade what we have in there?
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   How do we improve it?
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.060]   How do we improve it?"
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.100]   All they do is obsessively try to improve this one product.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.660]   And now I don't have to worry about any of these other things.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.060]   I don't have to walk into a GNC.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:38.300]   If I walk into a GNC and say, "Deeple Meeple" to the person behind the counter, some guy
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.500]   with biceps the size of a grapefruit is going to punch me in the stomach and then another
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.820]   guy is going to push me right back out of there.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.180]   I don't want to walk into a GNC.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.180]   I don't want to think about that.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:52.380]   I just take the Athletic Greens every morning and it gets done what I need to have done.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.020]   Then I don't think about it.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.260]   So right now, I'll give you a little bit of call to action here.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.660]   Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.740]   daily nutrition, especially heading into flu and cold season.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.820]   I'll say I add their vitamin D. The vitamin D they have in separate drops because they
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.820]   studied it.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.820]   So you can't have powdered vitamin D. It's not as good.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.580]   We need it with vitamin K. It has to be an olive oil immersion.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.580]   That's the very best way to do it.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.060]   So you add the vitamin D at the last minute.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   I'm big on that in the winter.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.860]   It's not as much sun.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.100]   It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   That's it.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.620]   No need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.580]   I'll also add there's no need to get punched in the stomach in GNC, which is 100% what
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.980]   will happen if you try to go in there.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.540]   You have to use athletic greens instead.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.180]   So to make it easy, athletic greens is going to give you free one year supply of immune
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:48.740]   supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:55.420]   All you have to do is visit athletic greens.com/deep.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:01.620]   Again that is athletic greens.com/deep to take ownership over your health and pick up
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:07.060]   the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.060]   There we go.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.380]   Between my body tutor and athletic greens, Jesse, our listeners are going to be superheroes.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   They're going to be jacked.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   They're going to be jacked.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.540]   They're going to be in good health, good shape, not sick.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:23.540]   And then they're going to return to GNC and they're going to fight that guy.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.700]   And that is ultimately what we're trying to do here is we're going to make our move on
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.380]   the over muscular guys at GNC.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.620]   Wait, what's this note you just passed me?
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.900]   GNC is our next sponsor.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.700]   Oh man, I got to read these things in advance.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.900]   We're screwed, Jesse.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.700]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.300]   I see I'm pacing myself now.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.940]   Little insider view into the show for those who are new to it.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.740]   But Jesse and I one take this.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.580]   We just turn on the camera and we rock and roll.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.380]   So I'm learning, you know, I got to pace myself a little bit, catch my breath because we've
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.460]   got a lot of show to get through here.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.380]   All right, so we'll start with questions about deep work.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.020]   Our first such question comes from Tyler.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:16.300]   Tyler says, I'm a subscriber to Top Performer Executive Edition, as well as a few other
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.380]   professional optimizing services.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:25.460]   All right, so just as an aside, Top Performer is one of two online courses that I offer
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.980]   with my longtime friend, Scott Young.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.300]   So Top Performer is a course about applying deliberate practice to get better at your
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   career.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.820]   All right, back to Tyler's question.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.020]   My understanding is that there is a lot of focus on building skills that move the needle
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.900]   in terms of hard skills.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.100]   But I wanted to see if you could touch on developing projects around increasing your
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.220]   exposure and image alongside your deep work projects to build their impact and grow your
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.620]   CV.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.860]   Tyler, be very wary here.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.340]   This is a trap.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:05.100]   There is a clear trap here that I'm talking to you about from personal experience.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:12.780]   The trap of focusing on exposure, marketing, presentation, how do I get the word out about
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.780]   this?
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.540]   How do I get the message just right?
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.860]   It is a trap because those efforts are seductive.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.380]   They're kind of hard, but not too hard.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.980]   And it's something your mind would much rather do than the actual deep work to produce the
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.180]   stuff that you're producing, trying to promote in the first place.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.820]   You look at things like what's my email funnel or my social media promotion plan, and what
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.620]   you see is what I used to call checklist productivity.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.940]   This is something you can get better at by learning the right checklist.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:48.900]   You know, I went and I learned how to do online marketing, and other people don't know this
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.580]   that are just off the street.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.940]   And now I have this insider knowledge, and I follow this checklist, and I have this funnel
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.540]   here, and I have this social media strategy there, and I'm spending some money on this
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.540]   graphic design here.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.780]   And it's all immensely fulfilling, and it's not really challenging, and it begins to take
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.780]   up all your time.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.740]   But in the end, what matters?
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.180]   Producing something so good it can't be ignored.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   So it is a trap.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.180]   Now, I said this is from personal experience.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:21.740]   It's because this is where I was when I first began to develop my concept of deep work.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.820]   I was relatively early in my graduate student experience at MIT.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.700]   I was doing research.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   I was thinking too much about what's the topic of my research?
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.180]   Like, can I find a sexier topic?
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.300]   And if I promote it just right and talk about it right, you know, I was thinking too much
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   about this.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.660]   Like, an idea for the research that would catch attention and get coverage.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:48.260]   And it was then that I came across Steve Martin's professional autobiography, Born Standing
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.260]   Up.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.020]   And it was then when I watched the Charlie Rose interview of Steve Martin, where he said
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.980]   to Charlie, "My advice to people is be so good they can't ignore you."
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.420]   This was a huge turning point.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.700]   Because what I learned was, no, write papers to get cited.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:10.020]   Do really good work that's really, really hard, and the rest will work itself out.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.900]   That notion got ingrained in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.500]   That notion got developed into my book, Deep Work, as well.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.020]   Be so good they can't ignore you.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.660]   Don't worry so much about how you let people know.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:27.180]   Now, it's not to say that other stuff is not important, but you should just get some reasonable
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.100]   evidence-based practices for how you present stuff or how the promotion works.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   Set that on autopilot.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.220]   So you're not making unforced errors.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.820]   You're not handing out flyers at the mall.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.820]   Yeah, OK.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   Figure out some reasonable stuff to do.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.020]   Set it on autopilot.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.340]   And then get your attention back to producing stuff that's too good to be ignored.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.300]   If you look at these two scenarios, I've produced something excellent, and I have a reasonable
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.580]   autopilot promotion machinery in progress.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.220]   Compare that to another scenario where I produce something pretty good, but have a cutting-edge
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   promotional apparatus.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.280]   I think all about it.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.560]   That first scenario is going to dominate the latter.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.580]   People find good things.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:10.980]   You can help them a little bit, but don't think too much about that step of actually
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   making an impact.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.620]   All right, second question.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.060]   This comes from Jim, the CFO.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   A technical question.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.620]   Jim asks, "When you develop your weekly plan, do you do your written version first, or do
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:34.180]   you update your Trello board first, or do you do both simultaneously/iteratively?"
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.860]   So this is a great opportunity to plug our core ideas.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.960]   We were just talking about this in the opening of the show.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.880]   If you're wondering what Jim is talking about with weekly plans and Trellos and updates,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:51.900]   go to the YouTube page, go to the core ideas playlist, watch the core idea on time management,
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.700]   and you'll know exactly what he's talking about.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.500]   All right, so Jim, here's my technical answer.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.240]   When I do my weekly plan, writing out the weekly plan is the last step.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.580]   So I go through a bunch of things.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.860]   I go through my Trello board and do organization there.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.060]   I clean things up and move things around and take things off and see what's going on there.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.020]   I go through my calendar for the week, and I look through my semester plans, what other
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.120]   people would call quarterly plans, to remind myself what I'm working on.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.460]   As I do this, I take notes.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.260]   I take it in a text file on my desktop, workingmemory.txt, and I'm just taking a bunch of notes.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.620]   Oh, here's some tasks as I was organizing my Trello boards.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.660]   Here's some tasks that are important this week.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.980]   I'm looking at my calendar.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.020]   I got to remember these big things.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.300]   Very unstructured here.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:41.340]   I'm just taking notes of stuff I want to remember, and then I use those notes from the workingmemory.txt
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.500]   to write my weekly plan.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.540]   So I do all the steps, look through all my systems, review all my stuff, take notes,
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.540]   use the notes to make the weekly plan.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.380]   That is how that works.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.780]   All right, what do we have here?
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.180]   A question from Adnan.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:06.460]   He says, "Does writing on digital paper, in your opinion, really have any advantage
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.220]   over conventional paper writing?"
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:16.980]   And he points in particular to a product that I've heard a lot about called Remarkable.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.340]   I guess they're now up to the Remarkable 2.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.300]   I'll tell you, I have not yet tried Remarkable.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:31.420]   It is very alluring, and I don't know if that's just branding or if it's actually useful,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.140]   because it's a cool thing.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.180]   It's like a tablet, and it uses an e-ink technology like a Kindle.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   So it's not a screen.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.180]   It's not a backlit screen.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.220]   It's actually, if you don't know how e-ink works, there's actually these teeny little
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.740]   disks that are black on one side and gray on another.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.740]   With an electrical impulse, you can switch it from one to another.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:56.060]   So it's literally making a non-illuminated, just an actual physical picture that you're
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   looking at.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.180]   There's no light involved.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.820]   This Remarkable tablet, you can write on it.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.380]   So it sort of follows your special pencil.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.340]   So you're writing on it, and then it can save the pages.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.340]   And you can go back to them.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.140]   So it's like a notebook, except for it's all stored digitally.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.540]   It's not actually a physical notebook.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.540]   Anyways, it's a cool-looking product.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.380]   I like Jesse's note.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.300]   I think this tells you why it's so appealing.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:24.580]   His note about the promotional video is really good-looking people in rich places writing
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.580]   stuff.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.580]   It's good branding.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.700]   I mean, it was a great video, and it's what it shows.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.700]   It's true, though.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.500]   I've seen this video, and I'm like, A, I got to go to Monaco.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.180]   B, I probably need to dress better.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.460]   And C, I need to be looking out over the bay.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   Yeah, in your mansion.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   Yeah, writing.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.260]   I don't know what.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.860]   Poetry or something.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.660]   So Adnan, if you use one, report back.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.460]   This branding hits me like an arrow.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.540]   And I'm like, I really need one of these things.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.920]   I suspect that-- let me show you.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.380]   This probably solves the same problem, because it's analog.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.780]   It's very easy to get to the pages you already wrote, because you can just flip to them.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.500]   It doesn't require batteries.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.620]   But I see that ad, and I want it to.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.020]   So I don't know.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.020]   Try it.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.140]   If my listeners out there have tried this and have a compelling use case for one of
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.980]   these e-ink notebooks like Remarkable, send me a note or send Jesse a note at jesse@calnewport.com,
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.980]   because we're curious.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.860]   Maybe it'll make us rich.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   Is that how it works?
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   We'll be in a mansion.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.300]   You'll start writing.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.500]   Your next book will be a poetry book.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.860]   Yeah, reflections for me staring at the waves from my mansion.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   Oh, my.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.980]   All right, what do we got here?
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.040]   Allie has a question.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:49.060]   Why are norms regarding maintaining email threads not widespread?
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:55.340]   Then she goes on about a very big frustration about email should be in one topic per thread,
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.180]   and people at my company don't do it, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.140]   I'm going to skip those details.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.500]   I'm going to skip those details to get to the bigger point here, which is a point that
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.900]   I really learned working on my book, A World Without Email.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.020]   Norms are not going to save you from email problems.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:17.140]   When I was working on that book, and I would go give talks, and I talked to executives
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:23.220]   or C-suites, I do this occasionally where I go talk to a small group of executives.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:30.140]   They were so sure that email was the key to a productivity nirvana, and the only thing
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.980]   holding them back was norms.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.820]   If we could just get some better norms about what should be in the subject line, how long
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:43.220]   you should expect for a response, what's appropriate in a thread or not a thread, CC versus BCC,
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.900]   then we would be in productivity nirvana.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.020]   The reality is that is not going to solve the problems.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.500]   Norms is not going to solve the problems.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.740]   The problem is that if your primary mode of collaboration is through ad hoc back and forth
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:03.780]   digital messaging, you are going to have a large number of messages arriving at unscheduled
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.740]   times that require relatively prompt responses from you to keep the wheels of your business
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.060]   rolling, and that's going to require that you send and receive emails all the time.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.300]   There is no norms that are going to save you from that if that's the way that your business
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.380]   is organized.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.740]   If this underlying what I call hyperactive hive mind workflow is implicitly how work
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.940]   gets done, there's nothing you can tell me about response time expectations.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.660]   There's nothing you can do with subject line edits.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.540]   There's nothing you can do about what goes into a thread and what doesn't that will prevent
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.540]   me from needing to check this inbox or this instant messenger channel again and again
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.700]   and again because there's unscheduled messages coming in that I have to reply to quickly
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.580]   to keep the wheels of business rolling.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.580]   So this is a distraction.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:52.000]   Again, this is you're on the Titanic deck, and you're really upset that the people looking
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.740]   for lifeboats are messing up the deck chairs.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.620]   You can get those deck chairs really nice.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.380]   You can move them in a way so people can move around on the deck really well.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.500]   But your problem is there's not nearly enough lifeboats.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.940]   That is the issue with trying to tackle email overload issues from the top down.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940]   So what do you have to do instead?
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.620]   Well, you read my book world without email.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.900]   And what that will teach you is that you have to actually fix the underlying systems for
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.380]   how you collaborate.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.300]   Instead of just allowing back and forth, let's just rock and roll on email beer solution.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:27.260]   You have to put in bespoke explicit alternatives systems for each of the different types of
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.260]   work you do.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.260]   Here's where the information comes in.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.860]   Here's when and how we talk about it.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.860]   Here's where we store things.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.460]   Here's the process for getting this done.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.380]   And you have to do that again and again and again for all the things you do regularly
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.020]   as a business.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.780]   That's how you fix the hole that the iceberg made in the ship and stop it from sinking
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.780]   in the first place.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.820]   It's processes and systems, not norms.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.260]   All right.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:53.860]   So I've given that lecture a lot, but still want that message to get out there.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.780]   Let's do one more deep work question.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.060]   I got one here from Peyton.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.820]   Peyton says, do you have suggestions for high schoolers?
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:08.220]   At my school, we have to check our email daily to receive updates from our teachers, and
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.860]   we rely heavily on our computers.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.340]   Are there tips you would have for students like me?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.220]   I do have tips for students.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.180]   The idea that you have to check your email once a day for updates from your teachers
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.660]   is not your problem.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.580]   The fact that, yes, there's work you do during the school day on your Chromebook is not your
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   problem.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.460]   But those are the things that I'm going to tell you matter.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:32.860]   And it's what you are doing voluntarily with your time and how you are voluntarily engaging
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.140]   with the digital world that matters.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.140]   So here are the rules.
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.140]   And I say rules.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.340]   I mean, you can listen to them or you not.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.180]   But I'm saying this is what I would suggest.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.420]   If I was a high schooler and I'm thinking, I want a deeper life, I don't want to just
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.740]   be anxious and lost in my screen all the time.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.900]   Number one, don't play online video games.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:58.140]   I'm not against video games in general as a distraction, but the ones where you're online
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.860]   and there's lots of other people on them.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.060]   In Roblox, I'm looking at you.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.060]   The I don't know these things.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.500]   Fortnite, I'm looking at you.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.820]   World of Warcraft, is that still a thing?
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.780]   Look, I don't know games, but the ones in which there's lots of people who are online
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:17.060]   on a shared server are some of the most addictive technologies ever created by man.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.240]   If you study digital addiction, these can be the worst.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   These are the worst.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.060]   It's not social media.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.620]   It's not I'm on YouTube too much.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.100]   The thing that can cause I have to go to a rehab center level of addiction is actually
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.140]   these massive multiple online games.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.400]   It's going to eat up your life.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.140]   There's better things you can be doing with that time.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:45.100]   You get very little return in the sense of connection, growth, resilience, character,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   skills.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:51.540]   You get nothing out of the time you spend when you're five hours in Fortnite.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.900]   Don't do online video games.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.120]   Second, don't do social media.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.580]   You can use your phone to communicate with your friends.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.660]   This is the good news.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.220]   This is a change that has happened since when I first started researching my book, Digital
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.220]   Minimalism.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:10.420]   Today, back then, social media platforms were critical to teen socialization.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.460]   Snapchat in particular was really big.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.500]   That has changed today.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.020]   The socialization has largely migrated off of social media platforms, especially for
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   teenagers.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.500]   There's text messaging and instant messaging tools.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.940]   The social media platforms are more about distraction, entertainment, keeping up with
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   cultural memes.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.380]   Just don't use those.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.140]   Communicate with your friends on WhatsApp and text or whatever you need to do so you
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:36.180]   can make plans and know when the party is, but don't use the other ones.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:44.060]   Yeah, TikTok is interesting, but TikTok is also designed from the ground up to be like
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:49.100]   one of those pods in the Matrix where you're in a bathtub full of goo and a robot alien
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.340]   has stuck a needle straight into your spine.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.300]   It's just engineered from the ground up to just press buttons and keep you looking at
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.300]   that screen.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.100]   And God forbid, if you are posting on TikTok, they don't even try to hide what they're doing
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.100]   there.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.300]   They are playing entirely with the weak spots of your adolescent brain to make you completely
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   addicted.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.660]   Here's what happens if you start using TikTok.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.660]   You post a few videos.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.620]   They have this all figured out.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:18.180]   They will wait until your second or third video, and then the algorithm is going to
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.580]   expose that video to a bunch of people's feeds.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.040]   And what do you see?
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:30.840]   You see a big burst of views, and you start to suspect, "Hey, man, maybe I'm on to something.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.260]   Maybe people dig what I'm doing here.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.700]   I kind of have a bit of an audience."
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.300]   And, "Oh, man, the next one didn't get that.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.300]   The next one didn't get it."
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.900]   But then the algorithm gives you another burst of views.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.140]   "Oh, that one caught on.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   All right, man, this is important.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.340]   Now I know I got my audience.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.340]   I got to be on there.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.340]   They don't really care about me."
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.100]   You are being 100% manipulated.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.140]   They control exactly how many views you get.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.360]   The algorithm has figured out how to titrate bursts of fake simulated popularity so that
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.940]   you think that you're one slot machine pull away from being an influencer.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.020]   All the while, they are just, "Here's your pocket.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.460]   Money, money, money, money."
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.380]   So just don't use it, man.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.380]   Just don't use it.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.380]   Don't use social media.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.580]   Don't use online video games.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:17.780]   Answer this by aggressively going after autonomously chosen positive social pursuits.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.900]   If you're in any way athletic, get on a sports team and get serious about it.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.540]   And you might have to do some exploration to find what sports team that is.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.980]   I mean, if you look at my history, I played all the rec sports.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:35.180]   I came from a family that said, "You've always got to be in a sport because otherwise you're
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.700]   bouncing off the walls into pain."
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   I played soccer.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.700]   I played basketball.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.660]   And I was terrible at all of them.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.380]   But then at some point in high school, I realized I had the right type of leg muscle fibers
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.100]   to run.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.820]   I got really in the track and track got me into crew.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   And that made a big difference.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.800]   So if you can do anything athletic and it might take some discovery, do that.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.980]   If you're not athletic, that's fine.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.140]   Find something else, a team.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.900]   You can be involved in this where you work with other people towards building skills
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.040]   in the competitive situation where things could go wrong, but you feel the victories
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.820]   when you have the victories and you're working together on it.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.640]   And you need this in your life.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.800]   Active skilled social pursuits that you can put a lot of energy into and to give you a
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.000]   lot back in return.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.340]   That's where you want to be spending your time.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.520]   Do that and also spending time with your friends and figuring out how to be a social human
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.300]   being and going to those parties where you're not quite sure if you should be in the party
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.700]   and try to navigate that social difficulty.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.380]   That's just calisthenics for your social brain.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.320]   You need to do that so that you're not weird when you're an adult.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.680]   That's all great.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.340]   Don't spend five hours on an online video game.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.640]   Don't be tricked by the TikTok algorithm into thinking that you are six dance videos away
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.920]   from being Kim Kardashian.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   You're not.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.160]   You're in the tub of goo and there's a thing in the back of your neck.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.240]   And I think this is easier now than it was five years ago because socialization as a
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.560]   teenager does not require you to be on these services.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.320]   That now happens separately.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.680]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:59.480]   Honestly, even if you have a flip phone, get the phone where you can still text, but you
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.320]   can't go on apps.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.440]   That's becoming the new countercultural thing, by the way, especially if you have some other
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.640]   thing you do really well, like you're an athlete or on the robotics team or something like
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.480]   this, you're like, yeah, I don't bother with that smartphone stuff.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.020]   That doesn't make you the weird loner anymore.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.680]   That makes you kind of the cooler guy.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:20.240]   So if you're doing that and if you very strongly ignore my advice from earlier to say, "Deeple
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.760]   meeple" when you run into people, I think you'll be okay.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.200]   Maybe they should do that more.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   I don't know.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   Deeple meeple.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   All right.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:36.440]   Jesse, I want to move on here in a second to do some questions about the deep life,
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:42.040]   but first we should get some deep payment from some deep sponsors to help keep this
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   show rolling.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.360]   I want to talk in particular about stamps.com.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.760]   Now this is one of these companies that just makes sense.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:57.240]   It's easy to pitch because it just makes sense.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.320]   You've probably heard about stamps.com, but let me tell you from personal experience,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.240]   it saves you the time, money and stress that they claim it does, because here's how it
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   works.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.080]   It allows you to access all of the post office or UPS shipping that you would do just from
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   your home.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.120]   You print the postage, you stick it on, you don't have to go to the post office.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.960]   You can be up and running in minutes.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.120]   You print postage for any letter, any package, anywhere you want to send.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.520]   All you need is a computer and a standard printer.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.800]   We're right down the street here at the HQ from the Tacoma Park post office.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.640]   And every time I see, especially during the pandemic with spacing, there would be this
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.920]   long line outside.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.240]   So it just made really visible pre pandemic, the line that would just be really scrunched
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   inside.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.800]   It made it super visible how long those lines are because it would stretch outside.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.400]   And every time I would see that line and think about just waiting in that line, I would say,
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.960]   I am glad that stamps.com exist.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.400]   So the other cool thing about it is you get discounts up to 40% off USPS rates and 76%
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.480]   off UPS rates.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   You pay a small monthly fee to be able to ship things straight from your home, to print
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.080]   postage straight from your home.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:09.800]   But you get such big savings off of that, that you are ending up making money, not spending
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.000]   it.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.880]   So save time and money this year with stamps.com.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:20.320]   Sign up with promo code "DEEP" for a special offer that includes a four week free trial,
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.380]   free postage and a digital scale, no long-term commitments or contracts.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.560]   Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone at the top of the page and enter the code
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.960]   "DEEP".
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.160]   I also want to talk about one of the longest running sponsors of the Deep Questions podcast,
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   and that is Grammarly.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.600]   You know, we're in it now.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.720]   We're in that winter grind period.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.740]   We're past the winter break, summer is still far away.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.000]   So we're busy, we're doing a lot of work.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.340]   And when you're doing all this work, you want to make sure above all else that you are communicating
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:02.320]   clearly with all of the different types of messaging that we have to do all day these
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   days.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.760]   This is where Grammarly comes in.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.360]   They can do stuff now.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.200]   This Grammarly product, especially the Grammarly premium product, they can do stuff to improve
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.720]   your writing that absolutely blows me away.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:21.180]   I mean, we thought about grammar support before, it used to be the grammar checker in Word
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.180]   Perfect.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.180]   It could do two things.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:27.540]   It could tell you that you spelled "their" wrong or that you did the possessive "its"
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.860]   when you really meant the non-possessive "its".
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.660]   Here's what you can do today with Grammarly.com.
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.300]   They can adjust your tone.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.500]   Hey, here is the tone.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.740]   This is coming across like this.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.560]   Maybe that's not what you meant.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.200]   It can suggest full sentence rewrites.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.780]   Let's redo this sentence in a way that's going to be clearer.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.200]   It can give you clarity suggestions.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.820]   This is probably not the right phrase or word.
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.140]   Why don't you use this word instead?
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   Look, I've tried this.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.140]   It is eerie.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.340]   It's like having an editor sitting over your shoulder so that the stuff you send out there
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.660]   delivers the point with the right tone, with a lot of clarity.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.460]   You're not confusing people.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.100]   You don't have people tricked into saying, "What did they really mean by this?
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.540]   Why is this so ambiguous?"
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.660]   Really is an impressive product.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.460]   We've really come a long way in this field.

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:51.660]   All right, speaking of deep, let's do some questions about the deep life.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:58.060]   Sandy asks, "What were your thoughts on the Get Back documentary?"
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.740]   She elaborates, "I've been watching the Beatles Get Back documentary, and one thing that strikes
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.580]   me is the novelty of watching people just hanging out, playing with creative ideas and
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.900]   without distracting technology.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.860]   I wondered if you have any thoughts on it.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.560]   They spend a lot of time just hanging out, apparently not doing much.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.820]   Is this important if you want to be as creative as the Beatles were?
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.740]   Do you think the lack of technology contributed to their brilliance?"
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.740]   Yes.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.540]   I think the answer is yes and yes.
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.700]   Creative work requires a lot of deep work.
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.200]   So there's a lot of moments of just being able to be very comfortable being very focused,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.660]   but also a lot of what we can think of as cognitive wandering.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:45.060]   It's the Beatles just hanging out, talking, messing around on their instruments, noticing
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.900]   things, "Wait a second, let me try about that.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.900]   What if we did this?"
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.700]   None of that can happen at a high level if you're constantly context switching.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.580]   Look at a text message thread, look at a WhatsApp thread, look at social media to see what's
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.580]   going on.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:02.020]   I can give you a very specific case study from exactly this world.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:07.540]   A couple of years ago I was communicating with a very high level songwriter.
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:12.640]   So she's well known and she works on songs for some pretty famous pop stars.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.300]   Not to spoil this for the kids out there, but unlike the Beatles, pop stars today don't
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.260]   write their own music.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.260]   Some do, but a lot of them don't.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.660]   But she wrote me because she was having a real problem.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:30.460]   She was constantly on social media and she had told herself this story about people need
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.240]   to know who I am and promotion and it's going to help me get work.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.260]   But guess what was not happening?
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.260]   Songwriting.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.820]   She wasn't writing songs.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:44.160]   She was obsessed with posting, but did people like what I posted?
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.260]   What were people thinking about me?
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.340]   What are other people doing?
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.460]   What's happening in the world of the related pop star celebrity?
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.980]   And I talked to her and gave her some advice and said, don't worry about people finding
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980]   you man.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.940]   What people worry about is are you writing killer hooks?
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.060]   And she did pull back and it made all the difference.
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.580]   She's like, man, I'm back into it again.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.300]   I just don't do this thing on my phone anymore.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.500]   That's a direct example from this world.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.140]   You also see this all the time with novelists.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.660]   Novel writing is difficult, cognitively demanding work.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.300]   It is very difficult.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   They don't mess around.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.820]   I mean, some do, but there are so many novelists that say, I don't want to have anything to
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.620]   do with this stuff.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.500]   I go, I disappear.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:27.260]   I'm Dave Eggers where I have a writing house with no Wi-Fi on an old laptop with no internet
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:30.260]   connection and eight hours at a time, you can't get to me.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:38.560]   It's John Grisham who like the groundhog comes out of his Warren in the ground once a year
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.500]   to promote his book for two weeks and then disappears.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.760]   It's like, I don't want to have anything to do with that.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.840]   This is like Aziz Ansari has a new comedy special out that I was watching the other
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.800]   day on the rowing machine and he uses a flip phone.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   He's like, this just was killing me and I'm supposed to create creative, interesting things
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.600]   and I can't if all I'm thinking about is what's happening on this little glowing piece of
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   glass flip phone.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:07.160]   I'm sure he could be on Instagram and Twitter and trying to get an audience back and now
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.280]   he's like, forget it.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.840]   I want to do this and I don't care if I'm less successful at it.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.180]   I can't do creative work with this.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.760]   So I think it's a good point, Sandy.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   It's not compatible.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.160]   Jesse, I hear this with sports too.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.680]   I've talked quite a bit of people within professional sports.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.920]   I've talked with general managers of NBA teams.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.200]   I've talked with people at national rugby teams.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.960]   I've talked with people within football.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:35.940]   I've talked with golfers and this is like a real issue is especially coaches and managers
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:41.160]   are very worried of the impact of the cognitive drain of looking at these things all the time
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.820]   on their athletes.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:43.820]   And so it's another world.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.820]   So forget creative stuff.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:48.040]   What about physical, high concentration, physical stuff?
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   Phones kill you.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.280]   A lot of the coaches, general managers, they're on their phones all the time too.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.280]   Agents.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.720]   Well, the agents are part of the problem because the agents are talking in one ear, especially
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:03.600]   so the NBA is a real problem because these are the youngest athletes of any sport, right?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.200]   It's the only sport where you can come out of high school into it really, right?
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.680]   I mean, you're not the play, whatever, professional football, you got to grow, you know?
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.360]   And so typically you're going to come out of college for that.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:19.400]   Baseball, you're going to have this 10 year path of the minors before like anyone cares.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.120]   Basketball players, you could be 19 and on the national stage.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.960]   And the agents are in their ears.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.400]   People got to know.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.360]   People got to know your brand, you know?
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   You got to be on there.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.440]   You got to be.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:38.100]   And they get on the court and it's not that they can't play, but I've had this conversation
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:44.000]   with a really high level person in the NBA at that level, it is a game of epsilons.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.520]   If you are 3% off of your peak, you're on the bench because everyone is fantastic and
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.780]   everyone is playing at their fullest extent.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.120]   There's really no room unless you're really, you know, Giannis or someone who has like
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.560]   a little bit of wiggle room here.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.560]   It makes a huge difference.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   These agents are in their ear.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.560]   You got to be on your phone.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.560]   You got to be on their phone.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.580]   It destroys their concentration and then they're 5% worse and then they're out of the league
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.620]   in two years.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.120]   A lot of them start clothing lines too.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.080]   You know, Aziz Ansari talked about this in that special.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.380]   He's like, yeah, a lot of comedians I know like have these other products and do these
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.380]   other things.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.640]   He's like, it kind of makes me feel like a slacker, but like, I just want to write, I
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.800]   just want to write comedy basically.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:35.480]   I saw a David Goggins video and he was talking about being in the gym at a hotel and like
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:40.520]   an NBA player came in with his coach and I forgot exactly, it was a Goggins video.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:44.960]   So, you know, it was like really intense, but basically like the long and the short
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.320]   of it was like the NBA player was just going through the motions and the coach, and by
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.080]   coach I mean trainer, not coach.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.120]   The trainer was like, let's do 15 reps, not 12.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.080]   And the player's like, nah man, I'm just doing my 12.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.760]   And Goggins went off on like, you know, not pushing yourself, whatever.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.880]   But that it's like an example of what happens when you have this pull from you coming from
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.160]   the phone is like you're doing the 12 reps instead of the 15.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:10.840]   It makes a difference when you're at a very high level.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.360]   So yeah, I'm a big believer in that.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.520]   I think it's a huge, it's a huge competitive advantage.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.080]   Be the guy or the woman not on this stuff.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.720]   I think it's a big advantage.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.520]   Yeah, you're gonna produce better work.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.760]   Nothing matters more than producing better work.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.480]   Social media, and I don't mean to rant too much, but social media is great for spreading
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.460]   the word about you, but it's best when other people are doing it for you.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.680]   So yeah, you should be happy that social media exists if you're doing something awesome,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.300]   because it makes it easy for people to talk about it, but they don't need you on there
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.500]   saying, look at me.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   That only helps a little bit.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   So there we go.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.500]   All right.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.500]   Let's see what we got here.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.500]   All right.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:51.080]   So we have a question here from Alexis.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.000]   More similar to a question we did earlier, so we can come at it from a different angle.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.400]   Alexis says, how would you apply the concepts of deep work to one's kids?
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:05.040]   So she says, I'm a parent and have noticed that electronics generally reduce our daughter's
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.960]   attention span.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.840]   As such, we ban video games and social media, but we do let her do protective activities
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.360]   on electronics.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.940]   Mostly we require reading.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.680]   She gets to do TV, movies, has earned time for piano school, et cetera.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.680]   What would you do?
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   Our daughter is 14 now.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.760]   I think that's fine.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.560]   So 14-year-olds are not going to be fantastic at focus.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.000]   It's a practiced art, and their brains are scattered.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.560]   So yes, avoid, as I talked about earlier in the show, avoid online video games, avoid
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.080]   social media for kids.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.400]   And by kids, I mean even adolescents.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.760]   That's going to be poison.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.440]   I don't really mind TV.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.840]   I don't mind your shows you watch.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.720]   You obviously do the same advice we learned in the 1980s, have some control over it.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.160]   So you can't just use the TV all the time.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   But I'm not one of these strict screen time zealots where my 14-year-old gets to watch
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   one minute of TV.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.840]   I think some of that's more about the parents wanting to feel like they're optimizing parenting
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.000]   than it is like it's going to make some big difference for the kid.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.960]   And it makes the kids kind of weird.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.500]   So I don't worry about that too much.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:13.560]   And then separately, you need to sort of introduce the notion that concentration on hard things
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.360]   is an important, respectable, really useful skill.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.640]   You can talk about this.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.040]   There's examples of this.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   We're watching the Olympics.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   We're looking at this artist.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.600]   We went to this movie.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.000]   This type of stuff that's really inspiring.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   How do you do that?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   You focus really hard on things.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.760]   You're willing to do it even when it's hard.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   You push yourself.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.160]   There's grace in that.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.920]   There's something really deeply human in that.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.900]   You demonstrate it.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.000]   If you're walking around your house as a parent with your phone, looking on your phone all
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.320]   the time, doing all these text message threads, it doesn't matter what you say.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   They see it.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   Like, "No, no, this is what life should be."
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.920]   So keep the phone in the foyer.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.080]   Don't carry it with you throughout their house.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.640]   Let them see in your life, "Hey, I prioritize other things.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.440]   I'm not constantly distracted."
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.880]   And then you can literally just give them structure so they can practice it.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   All right.
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:58.880]   So you have some homework.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.760]   Let's think through how we want to do this.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.980]   Let's schedule it on the calendar.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.160]   Let's have set times we do it.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.560]   Let's push ourselves, take a break.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.920]   How do you organize your thoughts?
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.880]   You could literally work with and practice and help kids get more comfortable with this.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.920]   I talked with my nine-year-old about this with math.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.420]   Really walking him through what are you doing in your head when you're trying to solve a
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.420]   hard math problem?
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.280]   Because we don't tell kids this and they don't know.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   Like, "I don't know.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.480]   I just kind of hope it comes to me," or something.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   Really walking them through.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:31.200]   Like, your paper is an extension of your working memory and it's a strategy and then you're
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   recording your work.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.040]   And then this is when you concentrate at very set leaps.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.960]   Like, it's not just random and it's not just you thinking and hoping something comes from
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   it.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.120]   So then you can practice.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   Practice structured thinking.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   So do those three things.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:47.040]   Do the poison, which is the online video games and the social media.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.840]   Demonstrate that you prioritize depth.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.040]   Talk about depth and concentration and how it's the key to a life well-lived.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.480]   And then actually literally help them practice.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.440]   And then don't expect your 14-year-old to be Richard Feynman.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.200]   It's a 14-year-old brain, not a 34-year-old brain.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.600]   Not a 44-year-old brain that's been doing this for a long time.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.240]   So then have some flexibility on your expectations there.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.520]   Kids or kids, they don't need to be, you don't necessarily want them to be super locked in.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.040]   That's actually something I talk about a lot.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:23.760]   I think, and we've talked about this on the show before, you know, careful what you wish
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.200]   for.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.960]   You get this around here in these competitive areas like the Washington, D.C. area.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.880]   This sort of underlying dream of like, man, I kind of wish my kid was a prodigy.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:41.160]   Like just awesome at math or something and just, you know, because you get as a parent
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.220]   these victory points, these victories of like, they're the best and they're moving up and
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.400]   you somehow vicariously take these victories.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.720]   And all I'm saying is be careful what you wish for.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.440]   Rarely the foundation of a good, meaningful, deep life if you're too good at something
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.840]   like that early on, be that physical or intellectual.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.520]   Careful what you wish for.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.880]   Same things you can do in your own life to feel good about yourself.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.440]   Not what did my kid do?
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.480]   Because you didn't do that anyways, so you shouldn't feel good about that anyways.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   All right.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480]   Enough about that.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.560]   Let's see what we got here.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.720]   We got a question from Abby.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:24.120]   Abby says, how do you motivate unmotivated students to get to deep work?
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.560]   Abby says, I find my work to be of Sisyphus.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.680]   So maybe she means like Sisyphean.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.880]   I teach high school chemistry.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:36.040]   We do lots of labs and discuss and construct concepts, dot, dot, dot.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.360]   However, since I started teaching five years ago, students have become less motivated and
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.120]   gross in their social media lives.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.520]   Parentheses, I hate the phone.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.800]   I want them to have a glimpse of the deep life and aspire to exercise and build their
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   brains.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   Where do I start?
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   Every day is the same thing.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   They do not pay attention.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.040]   So they either do not grasp anything or forget immediately help lay the future of humanity.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.400]   Abby, I feel your pain and you're not going to be able to directly solve this problem
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.360]   like you are in these kids' lives for a period each day.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.400]   But demonstrate the change you want to see in the world.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.480]   We were talking about this in the last answer as well.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.680]   Discuss concentration, mental difficulty.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.200]   I'm willing to stick with something hard even when it gets difficult and stick with it.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.700]   Discuss that as a tier one skill.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.600]   This is how these breakthroughs in chemistry happen.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.700]   This is how athletes become fantastic athletes.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.880]   This is how those movies you love are made.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:38.400]   This is how The Rock molded his body and his character into being an international superstar.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.840]   Focusing on things when it's hard, keeping your attention on one thing, persisting through
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.340]   difficulty.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:50.160]   Just giving this message, emphasizing this message, giving examples of this message,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   that does sink in.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.000]   It doesn't mean it's going to change people right away.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.080]   It doesn't mean you can get them off their phones.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.400]   A lot more has to be involved in getting that done.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.020]   But you lay down the vision of what the alternative could be.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.900]   You cannot escape from the trap of the shallows until the attraction of the depths is something
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.200]   that's even on your radar.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.000]   And so that's one thing you could be doing.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.960]   And there are schools, including some schools around here, who, for example, teach deep
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.000]   work.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.680]   And there's schools that teach my book Digital Minimalism.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.120]   Like, there's schools that go at this straight on.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.960]   We want to give you a specific frame for thinking about these type of things.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.920]   Otherwise, what's the model they have?
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.160]   It's like, well, if I'm on this phone a lot, maybe I'll be an influencer.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.320]   That's the only model they have.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.800]   And TikTok is tricking them into thinking that they're just one video away from that
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.880]   because it's giving them these fake view bursts.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.320]   So you've got to give them the alternative.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.840]   The deep life, a life built on focusing on hard but meaningful things, staying diligent
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.320]   on that, being resistant to distractions.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.920]   This is a very attractive, cool thing, because basically everyone out there who's really
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.360]   interesting that we admire almost always is doing that.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.960]   And when that message gets through, you've planted the seed.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   And you might not be able to grow that seed tomorrow in your class, but the seeds have
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.360]   to be planted if they're ever going to grow.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.840]   All right, I think we have time for one more quick question.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:18.360]   Richie asks, have you read 4000 Weeks Time Management for Immortals by Oliver Berkman?
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.000]   If so, what are your thoughts?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.200]   Yes, Richie, I've read it.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   I blurbed it.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.040]   Now look at the back of the cover.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.760]   Does no one read the blurbs anymore?
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.800]   I gave it a nice quote.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.000]   I then told Tim Ferriss about it, and Tim read it on my recommendation.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.600]   And he actually excerpted the whole first chapter and played it on his podcast, wrote
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.680]   a blog post about it.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.320]   So I've been trying to do what I can to spread the word.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.680]   I like 4000 Weeks a lot.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.640]   I think it's a great book.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.400]   And the premise of the book is we have 4000 weeks, roughly speaking, to live.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.760]   You can't do all the things you think you want to do.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:03.040]   So having a value-based system of productivity in which I got to nail all these, get all
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.880]   these different things done, and that's where I'm going to get my self-worth, through the
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   quantity of high-end accomplishment, is a sucker's game because you can't do all those
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440]   things.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   All right, so what next?
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.240]   And that's the question that Oliver addresses.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.440]   Once you realize when you're his age or my age or Jesse's age, we're all roughly the
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.720]   same age, that like, "Okay, well, I'm not going to do this, and I ran out of time to
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   do this.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.760]   And if this was going to happen in my life, I already would have had to been on the road
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.160]   to this about 15 years ago.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   So what next?"
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.000]   And that's the question that he tackles.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.520]   And I think it's a really big question.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.640]   Most things you can't do.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.460]   You got to choose a few that matter and do them and enjoy them and go along for the ride
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.440]   and be resilient when that ride doesn't go exactly where you think it would be and course
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.200]   correct when you can, but also recognize that maybe this vision you had is not going to
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:55.640]   quite be that vision and still be able to enjoy the wonder and grace of life nonetheless.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.860]   And I think that was the message Oliver was making, and it's a message that a lot of people
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:06.920]   were ready to hear, especially in this post-pandemic moment where everyone got disrupted and are
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.040]   asking these questions about, "What is the deep life?
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040]   What do I actually want to do?"
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.240]   So it was a perfectly timed book.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.400]   It did very well.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.200]   If you have not read it, check it out.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   Four thousand weeks.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.800]   And if you want to hear the first chapter, look at Tim Ferriss's podcast from last month,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.640]   I believe, and you can actually hear the whole first chapter online.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.280]   All right.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.960]   Well, speaking of not having enough time, Jesse, I think we should probably wrap up
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   this episode.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.660]   Thank you everyone who submitted their questions.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.840]   Go to the YouTube page linked in the show notes if you want to see videos of every question
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.680]   and segment done on this show, as well as video of the full episodes.
