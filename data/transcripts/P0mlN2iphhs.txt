[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   a great joy to see each of you on this class in this online format,
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.640]   and we're looking forward to a great number of weeks studying the word of God together.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.420]   I just want to thank you for joining us tonight,
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.320]   and we're just so glad that you're able to be part of this training.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.700]   We want to give a welcome to those of you who are continuing students.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.340]   Many of you in this class were with me last year,
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.240]   and you were working through the 24 theology exam questions,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.700]   and we were able to complete that study in December,
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.860]   and now you are joining us for the 20 counseling sessions,
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.300]   the counseling exam questions this January,
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.180]   and so I want to welcome those of you who are continuing.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.380]   I also want to welcome new students to this class.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.340]   Many of you were with me in year 1 biblical counseling last year,
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.760]   and completed that training in December,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700]   and you're jumping into year 2,
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.980]   and so this is your first time in the intermediate biblical counseling class,
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.320]   and you'll be jumping right into the 20 counseling exam
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.780]   questions as part of the phase 2 ACBC training,
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.120]   and we want to give a warm welcome to you who are starting phase 2 of
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.420]   ACBC's training, this is going to be a wonderful study,
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.020]   and one that I trust will be a blessing and encouragement to you.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.900]   Wherever you are in the training,
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620]   just want to give you a welcome.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.260]   Thank you for joining us,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.480]   and as we work through the 20 counseling exam questions,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.980]   which are part of ACBC's phase 2 training,
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.140]   I do hope and pray that we will be able to grow both in our understanding of
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060]   counseling methods but also in just our own lives,
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.140]   in our own interactions with others in the church,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.580]   our own relational skills.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.980]   This is an opportunity for each of us to think through how we are
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.860]   conducting ourselves in relational ministry and to grow in
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.820]   the practical skills that are necessary for an effective biblical counseling ministry.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.380]   We do look forward to a wonderful time together.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.940]   As we look at counseling exam number 1,
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.780]   we're going to be starting with that topic tonight,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.820]   the introductory session,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.340]   and I think this will be a wonderful study.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.880]   Let me pray for us and devote our time to the Lord,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.700]   and ask the Lord to bless our time together. Let's pray.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.260]   Holy Father, thank you so much for your amazing grace and mercy,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.340]   and just thank you for the wonders of our salvation,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.320]   for the joy of knowing Christ.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.460]   Thank you for the blood of our Savior,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.780]   which cleanses us from all of our sins.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.700]   We thank you that we are accepted and beloved in Christ,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.740]   and through the work that he has done for us on the cross,
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.940]   through his glorious resurrection from the grave.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.620]   We thank you that we do not fear death,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:31.460]   that death is merely the gateway through which we go home and be with the Lord.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.220]   We thank you, Father, that you've given to us the hope of eternal life,
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.780]   and we thank you that Lord,
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.980]   because of the assurances of the promises of your word,
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.020]   that we have hope and that we can have joy in every season of life.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.140]   We thank you for the ministry of your spirit who lives in us,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.460]   and who bears his sweet fruit in us.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.460]   We pray that your spirit would take your word tonight and change us,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.720]   make us and mold us into more of what you want us to be.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.100]   Bless each student as we continue our training.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.060]   Father, as we put pen to paper,
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.420]   as we put our thoughts down in a format where others can evaluate it objectively,
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.200]   Father, I pray that this would be a clarifying,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.460]   refining process for each of us in this training program,
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.780]   and that the result of our study would be
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.460]   effective counseling ministry that would be used by you to change lives for your glory.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.060]   We dedicate this class to you,
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.300]   and we give to you this hour of study.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.820]   We pray that you would bless it in Jesus' name.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.660]   Amen. Amen.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.460]   Well, if you look at the first page of your class handout,
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.020]   I want to jump right in to counseling exam number 1 tonight,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.860]   which is the topic of the importance of the first session.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.300]   So we're going to be looking at a very practical subject tonight.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.660]   We're looking at how do we conduct a first session with a counselee.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.580]   Perhaps in a potential counseling scenario,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.540]   you will be meeting with a counselee that you have never met before.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.860]   Perhaps you'll be ministering in your local church as part of the counseling ministry,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.660]   and you will be asked to meet with someone
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.780]   who doesn't even attend the church,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.460]   who possibly lives in the community,
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.340]   or maybe has some marginal involvement with the local church.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.780]   And you'll be asked to do a first session with a counselee.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.500]   And then there are the counseling situations where you do know this person.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.900]   Perhaps this person is a faithful member of your local church.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.660]   Perhaps there are relational connections between you and the counselee already formed.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.020]   Perhaps you already have a relationship that has gone on through years.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.340]   And yet in a formal counseling session,
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.260]   you'll be asked to conduct a first session with a counselee.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.900]   So this essay topic really is dealing with a very practical issue.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.220]   How do you structure and organize and plan for the first session with your counselee?
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:41.780]   And you are asked to write one essay of about a page to a page and a half on this subject.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.940]   So this is a practical essay,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.940]   and we do want to think through how do we practically plan for a first session?
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:01.820]   My prayer and my desire for each of you is that you will have many good first sessions with counselees,
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820]   and that these good first sessions will lead to further sessions.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.700]   And as you have good first sessions,
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.100]   which set the tone and the agenda and the goal for the counseling sessions,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:24.580]   that that will lead to effective ministry in your counseling ministry.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.820]   I have had my share of first sessions with counselees,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.380]   which have honestly not gone well.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:37.140]   I've had my share of poorly conducted first sessions,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.340]   and I've tried to learn from my mistakes.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.140]   And some of this session will be some of the things not to do in a first session.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140]   And I've also had, by the grace of God, my share of good first sessions,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.860]   which have gone well and have led to further counseling meetings.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.140]   And I've tried to learn from both the good and the bad.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.900]   I've also learned to talk to my fellow counselors in the counseling ministry,
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.380]   who are also conducting their first sessions.
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.260]   And I have just learned, quite honestly, to beg, borrow, and steal whatever works,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:20.180]   the practices, and even the organizations,
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.340]   the schedules that seem to work in first sessions,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.260]   and to use that in my own counseling ministry.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.780]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.340]   If it works in counseling ministry, then I do try to use it.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.500]   And just try to learn from other counselors,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.460]   as well as learning from my own mistakes and the things that have gone well.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.100]   So I am teaching this session tonight with that prayer
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.740]   that some of these best practices will be passed on to you,
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.380]   and that you will take them, and that you won't be afraid of conducting
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.620]   first sessions that go poorly.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.100]   I always say counseling is like riding a bike.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.900]   The only way to learn to ride the bike is to fall off and get back on the bike.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.140]   And so to do good counseling, you do have to do some bad counseling.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.860]   That's just the nature of the training process.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.340]   But I do pray that you will have many good first sessions.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.700]   When a first session with a counselee goes well,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.460]   it just really sets the tone and the expectations for future meetings
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.020]   and it is a means by which a relationship is built.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.700]   And I pray that God will give you many good first sessions
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.620]   in a counseling ministry.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   You can, by the way, recover from poor first sessions.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.260]   You can do-- if you have a poor first session,
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.020]   you can do a good second and third session and recover.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.340]   So there's hope for all of us in counseling ministry.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.340]   So on your handout there, I've listed a few helpful resources
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:02.340]   that I would highly recommend, especially the first resource there
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.020]   by Jeremy Pierre and Deepak Raju.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.060]   That's a book that's entitled The Pastor and Counseling.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.620]   And it's not just for pastors.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.700]   It really is an introductory book that contains the basic principles
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.740]   of biblical counseling.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.780]   It's a very, very helpful work, very condensed.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:27.540]   It packs a lot of helpful material in a short amount of space.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.220]   And basically, this book is a one-stop resource
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.740]   that a pastor who needs to do counseling but doesn't really
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:41.020]   have time to go through an entire three-year ACBC training course.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.060]   What is one book that would really summarize
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.900]   the essential components of biblical counseling for a busy pastor?
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.460]   And Jeremy Pierre and Deepak Raju have done a phenomenal job
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.060]   in condensing very helpful material in one small book.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.060]   And if there's one book I would recommend
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.380]   on just the practical issues that arise in counseling,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.580]   it would be Pierre and Raju's book, The Pastor and Counseling.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.420]   In that book, there's a very helpful chapter
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.940]   that's called The Initial Meeting on Chapter 4.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.700]   It's a very helpful summary of many of the principles
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.620]   you will want to cover in this essay exam.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.820]   And I would just recommend that book to you.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.220]   Some other resources that we've already mentioned in the year one
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.580]   training, Jay Adams, The Christian Counselor's Manual,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.820]   chapter 20 of that resource has a section on getting started.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.140]   And Adams talks about the importance of a first session
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.020]   in counseling ministry.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.420]   And then the two books that I signed as part of the year one training,
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.340]   we have John MacArthur's book, How to Counsel Biblically,
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.340]   and Paul Tripp's book, Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.580]   You will recall from our year one training materials
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.020]   that we covered the six key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.580]   otherwise known as the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.940]   And we'll do a brief review of that tonight.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.780]   And I'm going to suggest in our session tonight that your essay
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.220]   for counseling exam number one should be a summary of about four
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.700]   of the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.420]   If you cover four key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.020]   and then briefly discuss them, articulate them,
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.260]   and then apply them to the first session,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.340]   how would you apply this key element in a first session with a counselee,
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.060]   you would write a very good essay.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.300]   And so I'll talk through some of that as we go along.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.140]   But for the purposes of the resource, I just want to mention
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.540]   that the key elements are covered in these chapters
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.500]   on your first page of your course notes.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:11.100]   Wayne Mack has some really good material in how to counsel biblically
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.500]   on the six I's of biblical counseling.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.020]   And then Paul Tripp as well has some very good material there.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.940]   So if you want to review the six I's, review the six key elements
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.100]   of biblical counseling, those are some places that you can find
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.180]   some really good discussion on this topic.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.580]   And then three blogs that I would recommend to you.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.380]   Ken Long has a good blog that's entitled
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.100]   "Plan to Get Hope During the First Counseling Session."
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.220]   Michael Hines has a good blog on "That First Counseling Session."
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.460]   And then Paul Toczkis has a good blog on
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.260]   "Basic Guidance for the First Counseling Session."
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.740]   Now, you're going to find, and I'm going to make an argument tonight,
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:04.060]   that basically the three blogs are saying the same thing in different ways.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.500]   They're going to the six key elements of biblical counseling.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.340]   They're highlighting three to four of those key elements,
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.660]   and they're showing you how you would express or apply those key elements
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.540]   in a first counseling session.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.620]   They do it in a little bit different way.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.820]   They don't all call them the six I's.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.380]   They use different language for that.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.220]   But you'll find that the material is very similar.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.940]   They're essentially taking the key elements of biblical counseling
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.740]   and then applying them to a first session.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.140]   And I would suggest that that is a very good approach for you
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.540]   to write this essay, taking the key elements
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.060]   and then summarizing them and showing them
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.980]   how you would personally apply those key elements in a first counseling session.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:58.460]   That's a very good way to talk through or walk through this essay topic.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.020]   And so let me just read the question for us.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.420]   Counseling exam number one is, "What issue should be covered
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.660]   in an introductory session with a counselee,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.740]   regardless of the counseling issue, and then explain
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.100]   the importance of each issue?"
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:23.060]   As you think through the importance of the first session in counseling,
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:31.500]   let me for a moment ask you to place yourself in the shoes of a counselee.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:38.660]   And let's just say that you are a believer who is struggling with maybe
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   a particular sin issue that you've lost hope in overcoming.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.140]   Maybe it is a season of suffering.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.660]   Maybe you have experienced a personal loss.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.980]   Maybe you just need help in making a decision, a major decision that
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.780]   has come up in your life that's going to affect the rest of your life.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.380]   And place yourself in the position of a counselee
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:11.020]   who is coming to a counseling ministry of a church and asking for counseling.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:16.460]   If you were a counselee who was coming to a biblical counselor--
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.860]   and let's just say in this example that you haven't met this biblical counselor
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.780]   before, you don't have a previous relationship,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.460]   and you are coming to see an ACBC certified biblical counselor.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.380]   If you were in the shoes of a counselee, what
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.420]   would you want to see in your biblical counselor that
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.500]   would help you to be open to the ministry of God's word?
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.660]   Now, if you place yourself in the position of a counselee coming
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.740]   for counseling, I think you would agree that in some ways
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.140]   you will be feeling quite vulnerable, perhaps.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.580]   You're not in the strongest position in life.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.780]   You're not walking through a season where you feel self-sufficient.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.260]   You're coming and sharing with a counselor
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.180]   some very personal issues.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.580]   And so you are being placed in a vulnerable position.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.980]   What would you want to see happen in that first session
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.460]   with a counselor that you haven't met before that
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:29.260]   would motivate you to move forward in counseling ministry?
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.660]   If you think through that question and you place yourself
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.820]   in the position of a counselee, then I
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.500]   think you would agree that many of the things
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   that we talked about as far as the key elements
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.780]   of biblical counseling would be very helpful for you
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.300]   to be motivated to make a second appointment and a third
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.180]   appointment, and then to follow through with the counseling
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.420]   ministry.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.500]   I think that in the first session,
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.900]   if you were to meet with a counselor
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.380]   and you just found that this counselor was compassionate,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.660]   this counselor really did care about you and the Lord,
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.460]   that there was a mercy and a kindness
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.580]   and a patience in the demeanor of this counselor,
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.260]   I think that would motivate you to make
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.420]   a second and a third appointment.
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.580]   I think if you found a counselor who understood God's Word, who
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.940]   knew the Scriptures thoroughly, who knew not only
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.700]   the contents of Scripture, but knew
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.180]   how to apply the Scriptures to life,
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.980]   I think that would motivate you to make another appointment
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.740]   and to continue to be ministered to by that counselor.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.500]   I think if you were to find a counselor who
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.540]   was filled with hope, who not only had hope for himself
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.380]   or herself, but who had hope for you,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.780]   I think if you were to find a counselor who said to you
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.060]   in the counseling session that, I have hope
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.860]   that God is going to do a wonderful work in your life
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.060]   for His glory, and then not only share that
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.220]   as some kind of pie-in-the-sky sentiment,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.860]   but actually follow through with,
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.620]   here are some practical ways that we
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.140]   can pursue life change for the glory of God,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.300]   I think you'd be encouraged to move forward
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.220]   in counseling ministry.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.940]   And I think if you were to find a counselor who
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.540]   was disciplined in his or her listening skills, who really
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.300]   wanted to hear you out, who wasn't quick to make snap
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.020]   judgments, but really took the time
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.700]   to understand your situation, who asked good questions, who
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.020]   was focused, and who seemed to understand
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.740]   what you were saying, I think that would motivate
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.660]   you to continue with the counseling ministry.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.740]   I think you get the point.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.620]   If you were in the shoes of a counselee feeling
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.700]   vulnerable, and weak, and weighed down, and just maybe
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.420]   confused about the issues of life,
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.820]   and you were to sit with a biblical counselor who gave
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.620]   hope, and who was empathetic, and was filled with God's word,
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.340]   filled with the Spirit, I think that first session would
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.620]   motivate you to make a second and third appointment
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.380]   and to continue in the counseling ministry.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.940]   And so that is really what this essay is about.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.180]   And if it helps you to be motivated to write this essay,
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.260]   place yourself in the shoes of a counselee
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.100]   as you write this essay, and think through,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.140]   how would a counselee feel if you
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.860]   were able to bring some of these key elements
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.740]   into a first session?
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.700]   And so that's just a basic way to think through this essay
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.700]   topic.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:01.460]   Let me move to page 2 of your course handout.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.420]   And I've just noted some helpful comments on first sessions
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.980]   there by some trusted biblical counselors.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.100]   You have Jay Adams, who has made this observation,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.700]   that the first session is particularly important.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.100]   Basic trends are set.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.940]   Initial attitudes and decisions, as well as relationships,
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:30.700]   are formed by both the counselor and his counselees.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.140]   I found that to be true, both in my own counseling ministry
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.900]   and in the counselors that we have trained
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.780]   as part of the Counseling Center here at the church,
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.500]   that especially when that first session,
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:51.100]   the counselee is assured that you care about that person,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.900]   that you really desire that person to grow in the Lord.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.340]   And just that basic trust is built in a first session.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.740]   It goes a long way into setting up future sessions.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.140]   Ken Long has a good blog on conducting a good first session.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.580]   And he writes, when starting with a new counselee,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.900]   the first session is a most important one
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.780]   for both counselor and counselee.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.460]   A wise counselor once said, when you start,
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.300]   have in mind how you want to finish.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.980]   For us as biblical counselors, we
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.140]   desire that there will be God-like change
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.740]   in the heart of our counselee.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.980]   This kind of change points to the glory of our God
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.220]   and is good for the counselee.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.980]   From the first session, we should clearly
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:44.580]   have in mind the end goal that we desire for the counseling.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.700]   So it has been said, if you aim at nothing,
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.540]   you will hit it every time.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.660]   We should have an end goal for our first session.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:59.180]   And then I like Ken Long's observations about planning.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.620]   He writes, with this goal in mind,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.740]   we should plan our first session and follow through
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.540]   with our plan.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.740]   Another wise counselor regularly says,
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.500]   proper planning prevents problems.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.260]   In like manner, proper planning promotes progress.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.860]   And progress refers to growth in Christ-likeness.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.740]   Since the first session can be emotionally
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.060]   charged for all present, having a proposed plan
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   will help us stay on track with what we
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.820]   believe God wants us to cover.
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.700]   However, if it becomes evident that God
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.380]   has something different planned as the session unfolds,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.260]   we can then flex to adjust our proposed plan
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.260]   in accordance with his plan.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.700]   So we always encourage our counselors
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.740]   to have a plan for their sessions,
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.420]   to think through what is the best usage of that time,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.340]   and then not to be enslaved to your plan.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.700]   Allow your plan to serve you.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.620]   You will need to deviate from your plan at times.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.060]   And really, you should be deviating
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.460]   from your plan in many cases, as counseling
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.380]   is an ongoing dialogue.
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.220]   But it's good to have a plan.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.140]   It's good to have a map through the forest, if you will.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.900]   And if your counseling session takes you
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.380]   on a detour that goes into the forest,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.580]   that you know your way back to the path that you have laid out
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.020]   and that you don't just keep marching further
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.980]   into the forest until you don't know where you are.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.820]   And so having a plan for a counseling session
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.580]   is helpful, although we do encourage our counselors
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.900]   to be flexible with that plan.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.620]   Robert Jones has some good comments
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.860]   on a first session in counseling.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:57.100]   He says he has five goals in his first session on counseling.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.220]   He says, number one, to warmly welcome,
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.460]   to initiate a warm, welcoming, and caring relationship.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.100]   I want the person to know that I care about him,
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.220]   and I want him to experience that care
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.620]   throughout the session.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.540]   By the way, I have noticed this in our counseling ministry
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.620]   that a few of our counselors who are ACBC certified
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.860]   also serve with the welcoming ministry of our church.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.940]   And I don't think that's a requirement
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:36.020]   to become an ACBC certified biblical counselor,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.380]   but I do see how the two ministries
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.220]   do complement one another because these counselors serve
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   on the welcoming team of our church.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.380]   They have learned how to talk with strangers.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.820]   They know how to make small talk.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.060]   They know how to break the ice with someone
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.420]   that they have just met.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.500]   They know how to smile, even when the other person is not
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.380]   smiling back.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.260]   They just have learned these skills in welcoming ministry,
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.620]   and it does translate into counseling ministry as well.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.740]   And so if your church has a welcoming ministry,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.580]   you might want to ask the leader of that ministry
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.380]   if you can do an internship or just get some experience
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.420]   in that because it does serve you well in counseling
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.140]   to be able to have that conversation with strangers,
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.340]   with someone that you haven't met before,
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.820]   and just to have the practical skills
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.060]   to minister to that person.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.460]   Warm welcome.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.380]   You know, you don't want to be a counselor who
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.180]   says kind of a caricature, but you walk
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.980]   into a counseling room, you sit down with the counselee,
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.580]   and you kind of say, OK, we're starting our session.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.260]   What's the problem?
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.260]   Why don't you come in for counseling?
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.540]   And then here's the Bible solution to that problem,
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.660]   and come make another appointment to see me again.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.380]   That's not really how we want to conduct our counseling
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.860]   ministry.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.220]   So much of counseling ministry is just relational.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.260]   It's expressing that warmth and that love for others,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:24.020]   and giving a warm welcome is very helpful.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:29.500]   Just even some practical things such as, you know,
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.340]   would you like a cup of coffee?
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.820]   Can I show you around the counseling offices
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.860]   so you feel familiar?
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.300]   We want you to feel at home here.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.100]   We want you to feel like this is a place of ministry
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.460]   where Christ is going to meet you and minister to you.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.100]   Just some practical things to think through
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.420]   in making someone feel welcome.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.540]   Number two, he says, a goal is to know the person,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.020]   to get to know the person by gathering information about him
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.420]   and to help him to begin interpreting his life
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.020]   biblically.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.180]   I want the person to believe that I have listened to him
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.020]   well and that I can bring hope-filled perspectives
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.220]   on his life.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.780]   We'll talk more about that in just a moment.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.260]   Number three, to give hope in Jesus.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.340]   Jones writes that his goal is to present Jesus Christ
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.020]   and the hope he offers through his word and spirit.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.780]   I want the person to hear from the Bible
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.940]   that Jesus offers hope.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.460]   So as Adams has emphasized in his writings
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.180]   on biblical counseling, the first session
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.060]   is really a time where you want to give hope.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.860]   You want to make sure that the counselee understands
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.580]   that you have hope for this person.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.300]   You have hope for this situation.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.420]   You believe that God can do a good work.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.660]   You believe that, especially if you are sure
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.700]   that this counselee is a believer in Christ,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.780]   that you have the resources of God's word.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.580]   You have the resources of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.500]   You have all the promises of God that you
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.540]   can bring to bear upon this situation in life.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.740]   And so you want to be filled with hope
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.900]   and communicate that hope to the counselee.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.540]   Jones says that his fourth goal is
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.100]   to present a plan to propose a tentative basic counseling
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.700]   agenda and explain the counseling process.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.580]   I want the person to be confident
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.740]   that I can wisely lead him out of his present confusion
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.780]   to a clearer sense of his life and to understand
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.220]   that the process will not be eerie or frightening.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.780]   And then number five, he says that his goal
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.220]   in the first session is to encourage commitment,
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.180]   to invite the person and secure his commitment to counseling,
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.460]   including his desire to complete assignments
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.460]   and to schedule the next appointment.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.460]   I want the person to want to meet again
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.180]   and to have a desire to work on some homework that
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.060]   will help him.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.620]   And so that's a seasoned biblical counselor
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.060]   in just the way that he thinks through the first session.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.380]   You don't need to incorporate all of that
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.180]   in right away in your first sessions in counseling
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.300]   ministry, but just it's helpful to be encouraged
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.140]   by those who have done this ministry for years
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.300]   and to learn from them of how they think through the first
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.460]   counseling session.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.780]   I kind of reduce that to two things
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.140]   that I ask our counselors to evaluate
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.060]   in the first year of counseling.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.580]   And they are very simple.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.860]   My criteria are much more simplified
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.820]   than seasoned biblical counselors
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.780]   like Dr. Robert Jones.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.300]   But I do ask our counselors to evaluate two things
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.220]   after each counseling session.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.940]   Number one, did you love this person
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.700]   to the best of your ability?
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.420]   Did you have a heart that this person grow in Christ?
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:13.700]   Did you communicate that love in Christ for this person
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.780]   to the best of your ability?
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.580]   And then number two, I ask our counselors to evaluate,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:23.100]   did you open and communicate the truth of scripture?
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.140]   And I know that's really simple, but I
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.060]   think that's 80%, 90% of the ballgame
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.660]   that if you loved this person to the best of your ability,
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.500]   if you opened and communicated the truth of scripture,
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.980]   then to me, at least as a pastor who's overseeing your ministry,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.540]   that is a successful counseling session.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.180]   You can always do better.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.100]   You can always improve upon that.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.460]   But those two basic building blocks need to be in place.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.700]   Did you love this person?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.060]   And did you open the Bible?
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.660]   And we have just found that people
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.900]   respond to those two basic building blocks
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.420]   of biblical counseling.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.820]   If a counselee is a believer, they
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.540]   do respond to genuine Christian love.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.500]   That's just universal, that a believer
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.620]   is going to respond to other Christians who
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:22.580]   love him in the Lord and who want to see this person grow.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.420]   And then a believer will always respond
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   to the ministry of God's word, maybe not immediately
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.540]   in terms of immediate repentance and obedience,
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.140]   but there will always be, deep down in a believer's heart,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.100]   the desire to hear God's word and to grow in God's word.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.820]   And so those two basic building blocks are very important.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.060]   And we find that counselees are motivated to come back
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:55.140]   if we love them well and if we open God's word.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.820]   So those are just some perspectives
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.220]   from some good authors on the importance of this first
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.700]   counseling session.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.660]   Now, let me move to page 3 of your course notes
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.460]   and just talk through how should you
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.580]   think through the contents of this essay.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.500]   As I mentioned at the outset, I believe
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.900]   that the strategy for writing this essay
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.180]   is to go back to the material we covered in year 1,
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.060]   the six key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:36.420]   and then to summarize three or four of these key elements
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.300]   and show how you would practically
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.860]   apply those key elements in a first counseling session.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.020]   I think that's each of the blog posts
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.540]   that I have recommended to you.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.500]   That's basically their approach.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.620]   They're going back to the key elements of biblical counseling,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.020]   and then they are applying it to the first session.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.340]   And I would encourage you to think along these lines.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.820]   The key elements of biblical counseling
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:11.540]   were the practical skills that we discussed in some detail
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.540]   in year 1 training.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.020]   I'll do a brief review here just to bring
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.860]   this to freshen your memory.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.380]   They are in no particular order.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.580]   Involvement, number one, you'll remember this
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.780]   as the first I of biblical counseling, which
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:32.820]   is the skill set or the practice of demonstrating
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.260]   Christ-like compassion.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:40.940]   This is really the relational aspect of counseling ministry.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.180]   Compassion has been called your pain in my heart.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.300]   Compassion is disarming.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.980]   The qualities of mercy and kindness
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.380]   really are rare in this world.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.860]   And so when you do find a counselor who
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.380]   exhibits these characteristics, it is a wonderful thing,
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.500]   and it does help to build that relationship and trust.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.100]   The second key element we looked at
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.660]   was inventory, which is the ministry
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.460]   of active, intentional listening.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.940]   So as to minister to a person with knowledge
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.620]   and understanding, we discussed that good inventory requires
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.500]   good listening skills.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   It's asking good questions.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.540]   It is seeking to understand.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.020]   It is learning to conduct a conversation where
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.620]   you are moving from the external circumstances
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.860]   that a counselee is facing to the internal issues
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:46.260]   of the heart and just taking the time to focus on the counselee
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:52.420]   and understanding the situation that this person is in.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.100]   The third key element is interpretation,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.900]   which is discerning the problems biblically
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.340]   so that a plan for life change can be produced.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.260]   This involves asking questions such as,
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.660]   is this person a believer or unbeliever?
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:13.780]   Is this person a mature believer or an immature believer?
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.420]   How much of the problem is sin, and how much of it
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.820]   is suffering?
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.540]   What are the heart issues that need to be addressed?
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.700]   So this is the issue of applying God's word
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.060]   to the counselee's situation.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.900]   Number four is inspiration, imparting biblical hope
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:37.300]   so that the counselee is motivated to pursue change.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.700]   Counselees are motivated to continue with counseling
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.140]   when they have hope for themselves.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.260]   And in order to impart that hope,
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.620]   we need to have hope for them as well.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.340]   The sixth key element was instruction,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.300]   communicating the truths of God's word,
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.060]   and then dialoguing through personal application.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.740]   2 Timothy 3.16 says, "All scripture
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.380]   is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching,
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.140]   for proof, for correction, and for training in righteousness
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.300]   that the man of God may be complete, equipped
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.500]   for every good work."
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.860]   We believe that the scripture is directive.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:23.700]   The scripture encourages, exhorts, rebukes, corrects,
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.180]   admonishes.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.740]   In other words, our counseling sessions
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.620]   should not merely be a time for the counselee
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.260]   to vent about life's problems.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.100]   But the word of God, at some point, needs to be opened.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.060]   And the truth of scripture needs to be
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.900]   brought to bear upon the situation
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.900]   that the counselee is facing.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.700]   And so that is the key element of instruction.
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:56.620]   And then number six, the key element of implementation.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.900]   This is the method of assigning good homework
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.620]   so that the counselee applies the truth of God's word
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.300]   in between the counseling sessions.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.620]   We emphasize that in year one, that the majority of life
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.540]   change does not take place in the counseling session,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.140]   but actually in the space between counseling sessions.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.620]   That is when the majority of life change
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.780]   will take place in the life of your counselee.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:30.460]   And so assigning good homework is a very necessary skill set.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.660]   Homework that gets the counselee into the word of God
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.820]   on a daily basis.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.060]   Homework that exposes the counselee
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   to other avenues of the ministry of God's word,
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.700]   such as sermons, or lectures, or even good praise songs,
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:53.260]   or hymns, or other means of grace in the local church.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.820]   We assign as homework, very specifically,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.580]   even things like church attendance,
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.740]   that we want you to be in Sunday morning worship
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.580]   service each and every Sunday.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.300]   We want you to be in a small group
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.180]   so that you can build relationships
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.580]   and so that others can pray for you.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.140]   We want you to be reading God's word every day.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:17.500]   If you're not sure of the counselee's spiritual situation
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.820]   or their spiritual status before the Lord,
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:25.700]   you can assign as homework a written salvation testimony
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.420]   to be brought to the second session
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.020]   so that you can evaluate their salvation testimony.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.180]   It's such a wonderful skill set to be
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.820]   able to assign good homework.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.980]   It's a skill set I am admittedly weak in
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.300]   and trying to grow in.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.420]   My wife happens to be much more skilled in assigning
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.940]   good homework than I am.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.380]   But it is a very good skill set that
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:56.300]   will help your counselee to grow in between the counseling
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.500]   sessions.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   And so these were the six key elements
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   of biblical counseling.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.020]   This should be the review from year one.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.460]   We call them the key elements because we
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.260]   would ask the question, what would your counseling ministry
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:17.140]   be like if one of these six key elements were missing?
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.900]   And you could have great instruction
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.100]   and be filled with God's word.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.020]   But what if you had zero involvement?
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.900]   You just were a counselor who didn't care about people.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.940]   Would you be a counselor that people want to see?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.100]   Or you could look at key element number two.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.380]   What if you cared about people and you knew God's word,
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.780]   but you never took time to really listen to them?
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.700]   The whole entire counseling session
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.940]   was you talking about things that possibly didn't even
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.340]   relate to what the counselee is going through.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:00.220]   Would that counselee want to come see you again?
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.500]   Or what if number four, you just had no hope for people
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.660]   and you knew the Bible and you knew how to listen,
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.380]   but at the end of listening to a counselee's problems,
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.140]   you just were so discouraged.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.780]   And at the end of a counseling session,
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.980]   you were just saying, yeah, this is hopeless.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.780]   I don't see any hope for this situation.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:25.460]   Would a counselee want to come see you again?
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.140]   So we call them the key elements because if one
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.460]   of the key elements are missing, then really
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.740]   your counseling ministry is going to be deficient.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.340]   Now, what I want you to do for the purposes of this essay
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.060]   is to think through the key elements.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.340]   And I'll highlight four of them.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.100]   But I would like you to think through the key elements
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:56.340]   and apply them to a first counseling session.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.980]   I'm going to encourage you to look at four, at least four,
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.860]   or at least three, but most likely four
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.340]   of the six key elements would be a good essay.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.540]   And then talk through what would it
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.500]   look like for you personally.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.020]   So we would like you to, in some sense, all of us
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.860]   are going to write similar things on this first essay.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.100]   We're going to have similar contents because we're not
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.580]   really deviating from the six key elements.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.500]   Even the three blogs that I gave to you,
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.540]   they're essentially summarizing the key elements
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.220]   of biblical counseling.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.340]   And so in some sense, we're going
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.980]   to have a lot in common in this first counseling exam.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.140]   But in another sense, each of your essays
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.860]   should be completely different in terms of we
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.300]   want you to think through how you personally
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.420]   would apply these key elements in a first session.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.620]   So thinking through, for example,
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.740]   an approach to writing this essay
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.700]   would be to write a paragraph on involvement,
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.260]   that in a first session, I would want
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.060]   to make sure that I am demonstrating
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.100]   Christ-like compassion.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.340]   But then going from that principle
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.740]   to here's how or some ways, practically,
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:22.420]   that I as a counselor would seek to express compassion
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.300]   and mercy to my counselee.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.500]   And just thinking that through and writing a paragraph
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.780]   about that, that would be a good paragraph.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.620]   And if you take four of these key elements
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.500]   and follow the same approach, you
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.900]   would have a basic approach to a good essay.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.140]   And each of your essays should be unique in the sense
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.620]   that each of you are going to think
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.860]   through that in a little bit of a different fashion,
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:50.140]   although the principles generally will be the same.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.260]   And so each of your essays should have something in common.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:44:00.740]   But also, each of your essays should be distinct and unique.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.340]   So the four that I would suggest that you think through
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.140]   in terms of a first counseling session
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:11.220]   would be, number one, involvement.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.860]   So what would you do in a first session that
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:20.380]   would demonstrate Christ-like compassion and warmth?
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.540]   Now, remember, the question is, what
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.140]   should be covered in an introductory session
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.460]   regardless of the counseling issue?
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.100]   So no matter what the counseling issue is,
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.660]   whether it is a marital issue or whether it's
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.940]   an issue of anxiety or whether this person is
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:41.740]   facing a difficult decision, how would you show compassion
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.620]   in a first counseling meeting?
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.580]   The second issue I would encourage you to think
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.340]   through is inventory.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:54.620]   How would you do good inventory in a first session?
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.660]   What questions would you ask?
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.780]   How would you express good listening
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.820]   skills in that first meeting?
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:07.900]   Just thinking that through in terms of a first session.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.500]   A third element would be instruction.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.380]   You want to open God's word.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.900]   You want to establish in the first session
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.820]   that the counseling sessions will be focused on God's word.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.660]   Talking to our counselors, they have given me this feedback
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:31.900]   that sometimes turning to God's word is really just--
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.100]   it's awkward.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.260]   There's really no easy way to do it.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.980]   But at some point in the counseling session,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.300]   you need to open God's word.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.340]   You need to just say, it's time now to open God's word together
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.580]   and allow God to speak into the situation.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   And thinking through instruction in terms of a first session.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.380]   I would encourage you to possibly combine
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:03.940]   the idea of instruction with the key element of inspiration.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.540]   In a first session, typically, the instruction
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.740]   that I'm trying to give, the passage
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.740]   that I'm turning to in a first session
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.620]   is a passage that will communicate biblical hope.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.500]   So although there are two different key elements,
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.060]   they can be combined in some way as you
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.940]   think through a first session.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.180]   Usually, I am turning to in a first session
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.060]   a great promise of God.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.180]   I'm turning to some kind of scripture
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.660]   that will give the counselee hope that God
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.060]   is with them in this situation and that God
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.820]   is going to grow them.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.580]   And usually in a first session, I'm
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:48.780]   not going to a passage that is heavily rebuking or heavily
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:49.860]   corrective.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.740]   I'm going to a passage that shows
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:59.780]   that God is present to bless in this believer's life.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.660]   And then a fourth element I would
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.220]   ask you to think through in terms of a first session
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.620]   will be implementation.
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.780]   What kind of homework assignments
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   would you want to give in a first session?
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:19.020]   Now, going back to the three blogs that I mentioned,
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.140]   I'd encourage you to read those blogs
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.860]   as I've given them to you as resource.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.380]   Ken Long, Michael Hines, and Paul Toczkas
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:32.860]   read their blogs as they talk through their first sessions.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.380]   And then just note that generally,
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.700]   although each of the blogs say it a little bit differently,
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.740]   they're each summarizing basically these four key
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.100]   elements in a different way.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.540]   So they're using different language,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.500]   like Ken Long uses the language of get hope, gather data,
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.940]   give help, give projects for growth.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.860]   So he summarizes it under four Gs.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.700]   But essentially, the concepts, what he's doing
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.780]   is he's taking these four key elements
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.300]   and he's packaging them in a different way.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.740]   Michael Hines has the language of ask questions, give hope,
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.140]   and then assign homework.
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.180]   Again, it's essentially the same material,
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.620]   but just stated in a different way.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.820]   And then Paul Toczkas has the language of listen much,
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:32.340]   speak little, ask questions, apply appropriate questions,
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.740]   give biblical hope through homework,
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.900]   and then take them to the throne of grace in prayer.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:43.340]   Again, he's stating it in a very unique way,
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.940]   as is reflective of his own personal counseling ministry.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.820]   But essentially, it's the same basic material,
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.500]   taking the four key elements here
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.580]   and applying them to a first session.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.140]   So we essentially want you to do something along that lines
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.060]   and taking these elements and then
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   showing how you would apply them to a first session
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.420]   with a counselee.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.060]   So with that said, and the remaining pages
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.980]   of your handout, pages three to six,
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.300]   I have basically a summary of those four key elements--
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.820]   involvement, inventory, instruction, implementation.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.340]   I'm not going to take the time to go
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.020]   through all of that material tonight with the time remaining.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.740]   But I do want to just ask you to read that through.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.140]   Some of that will be a review from year one.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.300]   But then on each page, I also have some thoughts
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:45.380]   on how possibly that might apply to a first session.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.180]   And please think that through on your own.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.940]   Come up with your own personal applications.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:54.220]   But for example, at the bottom of page three,
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.500]   I've suggested some practical ways
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.300]   to establish involvement in a first session.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.180]   And just to encourage you along these lines,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.700]   as I was challenged this week in studying through this,
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.700]   just to improve upon my own preparation in counseling.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.620]   But I would encourage you that one
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:18.580]   of the ways to show involvement, respect,
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.340]   to establish a relationship with a counselee
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:28.580]   is really relates to being prepared for the first session.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.820]   And I'm just going to be real practical here.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.380]   I was talking to one of our counselors this week.
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:40.100]   And she was this dear sister in Christ.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.620]   She just walks with the Lord.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.740]   I mean, she has a living, ongoing relationship with Christ.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.420]   She spends vibrant time in prayer
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.940]   and in the study of God's word, just personally for herself
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.900]   each and every morning.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.100]   And she was just expressing to me
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.940]   that it's amazing how so much of just what she's
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.780]   going through in her personal life,
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.700]   in her own walk with the Lord, and what
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.260]   she's doing in her own personal devotions
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.540]   just naturally overflows and spills
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.060]   into the counseling session.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.020]   And I just rejoice to hear that, because it
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.420]   does point to the place of personal preparation.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.500]   Just preparing your own heart to walk,
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.340]   as you were walking with Christ, just
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.740]   repenting of sin in your own life,
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.540]   seeking the Lord in your own life,
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.620]   being encouraged in your own spirit and in your own soul,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.140]   feeding your own soul with the word of God,
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:42.220]   making sure that you are in a spiritually healthy place.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.180]   That is one of the best ways to show respect
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.300]   for your counselee.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.020]   Because if you bring that type of walk with the Lord
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:54.020]   into a counseling meeting, then it
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.660]   doesn't matter what the counseling issue is.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.820]   That is going to communicate something to the counselee,
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:05.540]   where the counselee will be encouraged to trust you.
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.660]   And then preparing for the counselee.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.660]   This particular counselor always asked
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.900]   me to get the consent to counsel form and the PDI form
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.620]   to her well ahead of time, because she
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.660]   wants to read and study and reflect and reflect
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.900]   upon the counseling issue and pray for the counselee
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.660]   before the meeting and just to prepare for the counselee.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:34.540]   I think that's a great way just to show respect for that time
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.860]   and to show respect for the counselee.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.740]   And then practical preparation.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:44.140]   I encourage our counselors just arriving early,
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.820]   30 minutes before your appointment,
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:47.620]   so you have time to set up the room.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:51.500]   And even real practical things, like setting
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.140]   the right temperature for the room
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.860]   is very helpful when you're going through an hour
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.380]   to 90 minutes of a counseling meeting
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.700]   and the room gets to be very stuffy or hot.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.940]   It's not conducive to a good counseling session.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.860]   And so just having the tissues in the right place
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.700]   and a Bible handy and pens and resources
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.500]   and just arriving with enough time
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.300]   so that you're able to greet the counselee
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.740]   without a hurried spirit.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.340]   Those are just some practical ways
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:29.100]   to think through showing respect in a first session.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.020]   I want to highlight also on just real practically,
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.620]   one way to be welcoming under the heading of involvement
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:40.940]   is to learn small talk with the counselee.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.540]   I have had counselors in phase 3 of our training,
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:51.060]   and you do record, I think, five of your sessions for audio
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.220]   and for your supervisor to review.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.540]   And I have reviewed some of these sessions
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:03.340]   and talked with our counselors about just small talk
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:08.380]   can be a good means of showing respect for your counselee.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:13.820]   It's a little bit jarring if your first statement
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.260]   as you sit down in a counseling meeting is to say,
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.380]   well, tell me about your problems.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:24.780]   All of us would feel a little bit like we're jumping
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.740]   right into something that maybe we're not prepared for,
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.980]   especially if we have not met this counselor before.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.820]   And so just learning the skill of small talk,
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.460]   where are you from?
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   Oh, you're from New York.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.260]   Tell me about New York.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.820]   Do you like the weather there?
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.980]   And so you're a Knicks fan, and just so forth and so on.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.780]   You don't want to spend 30 minutes on small talk.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:55.820]   The counselee has come to discuss the issues of life.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.780]   But a good five minutes in small talk
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.900]   is helpful just in making the counselee comfortable
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.140]   and then leading that conversation into a segue.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.260]   So finding a good break in the conversation
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:16.580]   and then saying, Joe or John or whoever you're meeting with,
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.420]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.180]   We're so thankful for our time together.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.660]   We're going to seek God's word together.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.900]   And then what brings you in for counseling?
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.740]   How can we be of help to you?
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.820]   And then leading the conversation in that way,
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:36.940]   learning to do a good segue, is very helpful.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.700]   So just thinking through just practically
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.700]   how to show involvement.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:47.780]   On page four, you have the discipline of inventory.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.660]   You can work through some of that.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.180]   A lot of that's going to be a review from year one.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:58.860]   But just on a practical level, learning
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.460]   to ask open-ended questions is a really good skill
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.180]   in a first session.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.140]   We talked a little bit about this in year one,
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.580]   that you can ask the question, do you want to get married?
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.260]   And the counselee says, yes.
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:21.660]   And that's not conducive to allowing the conversation
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.340]   to flow.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.900]   That's a closed-ended question.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.780]   An open-ended question would be, what
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.900]   do you think about marriage?
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.060]   What do you think are the blessings of marriage?
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.820]   What are your greatest fears about marriage?
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.300]   Those are open-ended questions that
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.620]   help the conversation to flow.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.980]   And so thinking through inventory with a first session.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.940]   If you move to page five quickly,
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.780]   giving appropriate instruction.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.860]   I've noted there that this point can
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:55.540]   be combined with the discipline of inspiration
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:02.900]   or imparting hope, having an arsenal of scriptures
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.980]   that really impart hope.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:11.380]   You ought to have a go-to five to 10 scripture passages that
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.220]   impart hope to the counselee.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.900]   If you're a member here at Kindred Church,
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.980]   any of the sermons that Pastor Philip
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.460]   has preached over the last five weeks
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.180]   are passages that you should have as your go-to passages.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.300]   Hebrews 13, 5 to 6, the Lord is our helper.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.540]   Romans 8, verse 28, that all things
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.860]   work together for good to those who love God,
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.180]   and so forth and so on.
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.420]   Those are passages that communicate hope
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.500]   to the counselee.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.140]   And it's one thing to hear it preached.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.220]   It's another thing to minister that to a counselee
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.580]   in such a way where you're saying that the Lord is
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.260]   your helper, Joe.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.300]   Joe, God has promised never to leave you or forsake you
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.100]   in this trial.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.820]   There's a powerful ministry there
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.860]   when those truths are communicated one-on-one
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.180]   from a counselor to a counselee.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:13.260]   And then on the last page, assigning good homework,
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:14.300]   let me just--
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:18.260]   and I'll draw our thoughts to a close by saying this.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.980]   Really, practically, in our counseling ministry,
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:28.860]   we have found that there are three things that
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.180]   are just so basic.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.580]   They apply to every counseling situation.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.380]   You don't even need to get into all
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.580]   of the biblical counseling resources
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.740]   and all the specific issues.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.580]   But we have found that our counselees grow
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.020]   when they do three things.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:48.580]   And this is not going to be any surprise.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.020]   I'm not going to sell anything new here.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:57.340]   But three things is, number one, if they read the Bible every day,
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.660]   then they will grow.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:04.780]   Number two, if they attend Sunday morning worship
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.060]   every Sunday and hear the preached word,
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.940]   then they will grow.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.340]   And then number three, if they are
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.900]   in some type of small group fellowship
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.780]   where they're building relationships
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.340]   and they're having people pray for them,
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.820]   and they're not anonymous, but they are known
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.860]   and they have relationships in the local church,
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:26.700]   then they will grow.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.300]   Those three things, reading the Bible every day,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.700]   attending Sunday morning worship every Sunday,
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.100]   and then being part of some type of small group fellowship
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.620]   where they have relationships in the local church, those three
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:43.300]   things, we have found they just work.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.940]   Believers grow when they do those three things.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.420]   And we also found that most of our counselees
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:53.260]   are not regularly doing those three things.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:58.060]   That usually they're reading the Bible once or twice a week,
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.580]   maybe, or just sporadically, but they're not
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.260]   engaged in daily Bible reading.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.500]   They're not coming to church every Sunday.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.580]   They might come two times a month,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.380]   or they might sporadically check in,
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.340]   but they're not regularly sitting in Sunday morning
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.100]   worship service each and every Sunday.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.900]   And if it's in a marital situation,
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.620]   then they're not sitting with their spouse in the worship
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.940]   service.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.820]   And that's key.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:29.340]   There's something that happens, many beneficial effects
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:33.180]   that happen in a marriage when husband and wife sit
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.340]   in worship service together each and every Sunday.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.980]   And then thirdly, generally, they're
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.420]   anonymous in the local church.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.340]   They don't really have relationships.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.380]   People don't know them.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.420]   They don't know people.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.940]   No one's praying for them.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.700]   They're not praying for anyone.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.580]   They may attend and slip in and out,
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.180]   but they don't have real relationships
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.060]   in the local church.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.420]   And so we just have started assigning as homework,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.380]   as an initial meeting, we've just
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.220]   started assigning those three things.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.700]   And I've worked with our counselors
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.300]   to make sure before you get into all the specifics about panic
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.820]   attacks or anger issues or conflict resolution,
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.780]   there is a place to get very specific with those things.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.540]   But before you get in too deep, make
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.700]   sure those three basic things are in place
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.900]   in your counselee's life.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.780]   Make sure they're reading the Bible every day.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.380]   Doesn't matter.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.180]   It doesn't have to be only the passages dealing
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.340]   with their counseling issue.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.660]   It could really just be reading through the Bible,
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.540]   reading a chapter a day in scripture,
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.060]   but making sure it's every day.
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.660]   Make sure that they're going to church every Sunday
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.460]   and hearing the preached word, and make sure
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.580]   that they have relationships in the local church.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:46.940]   And we found that when we assign those three things as homework,
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.660]   and the beauty of it is, you can assign them as homework.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.380]   You say, here's your homework.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.140]   We want you to read the Bible every day,
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.420]   go to church on Sunday, and join a small group.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.140]   And then you can check with them in the second and third meeting
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.860]   to see if they follow through.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.420]   When believers do those three things,
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.700]   they tend to get healthier just in general.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.460]   They just tend to grow, because those
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460]   are the means of grace God has put in His word.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.740]   There's no secret magic sauce to it.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.220]   People grow when they're in God's word,
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.620]   when they're worshiping on Sundays,
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.340]   and when they have relationships in the local church.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.140]   When they grow generally, then it
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.500]   seems to be that their specific counseling issue also
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.020]   gets addressed in some way.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.220]   Now, you will need to get more specific,
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.100]   but if they're generally getting more healthy,
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.940]   then their counseling issue also tends to get
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.300]   addressed in a general fashion.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.380]   And then you have the platform and the foundation
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.180]   to go more specific.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.580]   So just think through that in terms of homework.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:56.300]   I've encouraged our counselors, assign those things
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.020]   as homework.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.940]   You can tell them, your homework is to join this small group.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.940]   You can even get specific as if a counselee really
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.420]   is kind of reluctant to get into fellowship,
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.340]   that I want you to get into a small group,
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.620]   and then I want you, when the small group ends,
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:19.660]   to talk to three people during the snack time,
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.060]   learn their names, and ask them their prayer requests.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.260]   I mean, you can get that specific with homework.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.980]   Or even just, I want you to attend on Sunday morning
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.300]   worship.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.780]   I want you, after service, to talk to one person that you
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.860]   know and one person that you don't know,
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.580]   just to get them into fellowship.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.380]   Because oftentimes, they're isolated.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.580]   You can assign those things as homework,
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.460]   and those are the basic building blocks that help people grow.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:51.900]   And so think through those four key elements,
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.460]   apply them to a first session.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.300]   And I trust that you'll write a great essay,
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.460]   and it'll be a helpful resource for you in the years to come.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.420]   Well, what I'm going to do at this point,
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   I'm going to close in prayer.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:10.380]   But I'm going to hang out for 10 minutes
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.820]   after class for new students, for those of you
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.420]   who are joining in year two.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.180]   And this is your first session that
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.060]   is dealing with phase two of ACBC training.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.380]   And if you have any questions about how to write an essay
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.980]   or any questions about the essay writing process,
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.900]   I'd be happy to hang out for 10 minutes or so,
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.780]   or as long as you have questions and if I could be helpful.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.220]   I'd love to just be able to orient you to the essay writing
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.980]   process itself.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.540]   If you're a continuing student, you can be excused.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.260]   I mean, you're welcome to hang out,
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.460]   but I'll probably be repeating some material
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.900]   that you've already heard.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.500]   But if you're a new student and this is the first time
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.820]   that you're writing an essay, I'd
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.780]   encourage you to stay with me after I close in prayer.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.980]   I'll mention a few things in the syllabus
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.940]   and then open it up for questions
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.100]   if you have questions about writing the essays.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:04.900]   But Lord bless you.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.500]   We pray that this material will serve you well
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.260]   and that you will have great first sessions that
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.620]   lead to future sessions that will be used for God's glory.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:19.220]   So let me pray for us and we'll close our official teaching
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:19.940]   time together.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.900]   Father, thank you for our time in your word
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.980]   and our time to think through just very practically what
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.620]   a first session looks like in counseling ministry.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.420]   Thank you for these key elements that
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.980]   have been derived from your word and articulated
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.580]   by many men and women who have been
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.060]   effective in biblical counseling.
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:48.460]   And we thank you that these elements have shown themselves
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.340]   to be fruitful.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.740]   And we pray that you would help us
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.580]   to think through our own counseling
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.500]   ministry along these lines.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.220]   Help us, Lord, to grow in these things,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:05.020]   to grow in our listening skills, our compassionate demeanor,
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.660]   our relational skills, to grow in our ability
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:12.020]   to communicate your word, to give hope, and also, Lord,
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.900]   to assign good practical homework.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.180]   And we just pray that you would train us
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.340]   to be effective counselors for your glory.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.140]   Pray that each of the students here
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.220]   would write a great essay for your glory.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.620]   And we thank you for this time.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.300]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.420]   Amen.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.660]   Well, I am going to hang out here for 10 minutes.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.020]   If you are a new student, I'm going
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.780]   to go through just a couple points on your syllabus.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.820]   And then if you have any questions on essay writing,
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.500]   I'd be happy to answer that.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.980]   There's a Q&A panel there and also a chat function
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   that feel free to ask any questions that you might have.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.300]   But the syllabus is basically--
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.380]   I think it's 10 pages here that I've given you
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:07.660]   some of the material that I've given to students
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:13.420]   as we've walked through the essays together in the past.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.740]   And I've just put some practical suggestions
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.580]   on how to schedule your week, how to write a good essay.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.580]   We would encourage you to get Microsoft Word.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:33.020]   And the essays need to be in a DOC or DOCX format.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.740]   And so we have had very little success
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.780]   in using other word processing platforms.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.020]   So we just encourage you to get Microsoft Word
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:48.900]   and put it in a format where ACBC can read and grade
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.380]   these essays.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:55.100]   We did send you a template of the counseling exams.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.700]   And I encourage you to use that for the right formatting.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.900]   And that should be in a Microsoft Word document.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:06.940]   So we're looking for a page to a page and a half.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.220]   Any essay that's less than a page long,
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:15.900]   you're probably not writing enough material.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.660]   Anything that is coming to close to two pages
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.780]   is probably too much.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.380]   And you're going to need to edit your material.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.300]   And so we're looking for about a page and a half.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.780]   I'm very comfortable with a page and a half
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.660]   when the student turns in their essay
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.980]   and it's about a page and a half.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.940]   That's a good essay typically.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:42.980]   And there's a prescribed formatting of 1.5 spacing
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.580]   and 12 point font times New Roman.
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:49.180]   So we're looking at about the same material for each person.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.660]   We just encourage you to--
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.940]   on page four of your syllabus, I'll
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:04.820]   highlight a couple of points here.
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   They ask you to write the answers
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.420]   as though you are explaining them to a counselee,
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.940]   defining all terms clearly and precisely
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.540]   with scriptural support for your answer.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.180]   So the idea here is you're sitting down with a counselee.
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:21.580]   How would you communicate some of these things
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:26.580]   in your own language to another person?
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:32.300]   We encourage you to footnote any quotes or any sources that
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:32.820]   are used.
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:41.180]   I encourage my students, please do not footnote my notes
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.460]   because my notes are not published material.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:48.060]   We're asking you to footnote published material that
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.820]   is from a reputable source.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.020]   So anything that can be sold on Amazon
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.100]   is usually a published resource that you
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.260]   can footnote and quote from.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.540]   But my notes, if you're going to use any material from my notes,
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.100]   you will want to put that in your own language
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:09.420]   as how would you communicate that material to a counselee
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.340]   in your own language.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:15.980]   And so just a note about footnotes there.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:21.180]   ACBC isn't really crazy strict about the format of footnotes.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.380]   I encourage students--
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.620]   and I'll send you a link to go ahead
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:30.700]   and why not use the Terabian format.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.860]   It'll make your footnotes look nice.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.060]   And it'll just put a nice little shine to your essay.
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:40.460]   And so I encourage our students to go ahead and use
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.780]   the Terabian format for footnotes.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.460]   And I'll send you a link that shows you
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.180]   how to do all of that.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.100]   Exams are graded on a pass, rewrite, or fatal error basis.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.460]   I've yet to have a student in fatal error.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.700]   I hope not to have one yet.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:03.540]   We usually have our students turn in their essays to ACBC.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.260]   And they generally have to rewrite two to three essays.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.580]   So don't be discouraged if you get to that point
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.780]   and you have to rewrite an essay.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.380]   That's kind of par for the course.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.620]   But we do encourage you to stay out
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:24.180]   of the fatal error category.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.300]   I don't think I've had a student do that.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.940]   So please don't be the first.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.420]   I think you have to say some kind of crazy things
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.740]   to get into the fatal error category.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.860]   So I trust you won't--
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.820]   that none of my students will do that.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:46.580]   A couple notes on just on page 5.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.220]   I just have some practical notes there.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.540]   You can read that on your own.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:55.060]   But generally, simple sentences are
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.660]   better than complicated ones.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.220]   Much of the work I think that I've
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.300]   done with students in this class is
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.820]   helping them to write simple sentences, a subject predicate
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.500]   period.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:13.380]   And people tend to write very long, complicated sentences
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   that really should be broken up into three separate sentences.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.820]   And so I just encourage you to just be
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.300]   very simple in your writing.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.980]   You don't have to do a long, complicated sentence.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:29.660]   Subject, predicate, period, subject, predicate, period
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.100]   will get you through.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:39.020]   And just simpler is better in terms of your writing.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:44.580]   I'd encourage you to download the Grammarly.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.580]   I think it's a software that's available online that's free.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.900]   I've downloaded that.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:52.140]   And I haven't paid a cent for that.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.820]   If you're struggling with grammar
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:58.820]   or you want someone to look over your grammar,
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.820]   we do have one of the counselors in our ministry
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:08.140]   who is a certified counselor who is also a professional editor.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:12.140]   And she's available to read through one to two
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:15.980]   of your essays to let you know if you're on the right track.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:22.100]   But generally speaking, Grammarly, the software
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.980]   will catch almost all of your grammar errors.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.500]   And so anything that a professional editor will catch,
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.260]   Grammarly will catch before you have to send it to someone.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.580]   So I encourage you to get Grammarly.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:40.180]   And I think I'll send you a link on that.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.400]   And it'll catch all of your errors
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.140]   and make you look like you have perfect English.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:54.180]   So good resources there.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:59.620]   And then on your handout, I have a capitalization checklist.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.300]   Some common errors we see with capitalization
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:08.900]   is biblical, is not capitalized.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:14.300]   You have some other gospel, as in the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.380]   is not capitalized.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.520]   The gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John is capitalized.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.180]   There's just some things there that you
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:25.740]   need to check in terms of capitalization that is found
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.700]   on that capitalization checklist.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:32.160]   And then for abbreviations for Bible books,
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.780]   I would encourage you to use the resource there
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:39.220]   that has abbreviations from both Old Testament and New
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.700]   Testament.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.780]   OK, much more can be said about the essays,
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.340]   but just some brief orientation comments on them.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.780]   And then I will take some questions, I think,
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.660]   on the chat if you have questions here.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:56.920]   OK, first question is, when is the first essay due?
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.660]   So the essays really can be written at your own pace.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:06.100]   I have had students complete them very quickly.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:12.180]   I had some students last year take year one and year two
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.980]   concurrently and finish their essays by the end of the year.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.620]   And I also have students who they take three years
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.820]   to complete their essays, but they do get done.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.540]   So what I'm going to be doing is teaching one essay a week.
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:31.740]   And so if you want to use that as a schedule,
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.220]   that you'll write one essay a week,
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.500]   that'll get you through the 44 essays in the space of a year.
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:43.380]   But you're not turning your essays into me every week.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.020]   What I'm going to be doing is taking--
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:51.840]   once you have finished all of your essay exams,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.440]   at that point, you'll turn into me the full 44 essays.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.020]   And then at that point, I'll do a final review.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:05.100]   Once again, if you want a weekly feedback on your essays,
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.820]   I'd encourage you to get an accountability
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.700]   partner in the class.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.540]   And also, we have a counselor who
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.060]   will do a review of one to two of your essays in this course.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.060]   Unfortunately, because of the number of students
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.420]   in the course, I'm not able to do a weekly review
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.540]   of each student's essays.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.380]   But if you want to send one to two of your essays,
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.460]   typically, we'll check that.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.180]   And we'll say, hey, you're doing great.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.340]   You're on the right track.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.380]   This is good material.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.140]   And just encourage you to keep going there.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:38.900]   Great question.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.700]   So a second question is, will the recording be available?
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.780]   The answer is yes.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.340]   Every recording will be made available the following week.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.180]   And so if you can't make a Sunday night class
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.060]   and you want to watch that the following week,
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:56.020]   we will make that available on YouTube every week.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:01.260]   A question is, page four of the syllabus,
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.900]   are there two-word documents for two exams?
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.940]   So the answer is yes.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.220]   Great, that's a great observation.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.860]   So at the end of this entire process, what you're going
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.540]   to have is two Microsoft Word documents.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:20.780]   You'll have one document that has 24 theology exam essays.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.860]   And that should run about 30 to 35 pages.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.940]   And then you will have a second document
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.740]   that has the 20 counseling exam essays, which will probably
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.020]   run 25 to 30 pages as well.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:38.300]   So those two documents, you're going
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.220]   to turn those in to me at that point.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.620]   And I'll do a final review.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.540]   And then you'll turn them into ACBC.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:50.100]   And that'll be the marker of completion of phase two
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.060]   training.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.740]   And that'll get you into phase three of ACBC training.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.180]   The 44 essays, they're tough.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:08.420]   It's not an issue of so much that each essay is so complex.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:14.180]   But it's tough to do an essay a week for 44 weeks.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.900]   That's really the challenge, is to persevere
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.540]   and to keep going in that study.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.860]   And so I don't know any other way to say that,
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.620]   except that's a challenge.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:28.980]   And at the same time, I've had people come to me and say,
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:33.060]   you know, Dan, I haven't written anything in 20 years
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.700]   since high school.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.260]   I haven't written an essay.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.500]   And yet, they're faithful every week to get their essay done.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.540]   And they finish their 44 essays.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:46.260]   And other people who may have more experience or more
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.740]   education that they are not able to finish
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:54.460]   for whatever reasons, it really is a matter of plotting
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:57.220]   and getting the next essay done and persevering
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.100]   through that process.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.780]   And so we do try to motivate you and keep you going
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.780]   and keep you excited about it.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:08.180]   But that is the process in phase two of ACBC training.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:15.300]   One question is the name of the editor who offered
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.980]   to look over one of the essays.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.860]   So Joan Shim is a professional editor.
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.820]   She's also an ACBC counselor.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:28.900]   And she works with us here in the counseling ministry.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.620]   I'm going to check with her real quick before I send you
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.700]   all her email, just to make sure that she's
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.820]   ready to review your essays.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.620]   But she is-- she's a tough editor.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.500]   I mean, very fair.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.740]   She catches every mistake and knows her work well.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.700]   And so she is going to--
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.020]   she has offered to look over one to two examples.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.380]   So she's not going to look over all 44 of your essays,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.740]   but she'll look over one to two of your essays
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.660]   to make sure you're on the right track.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:04.540]   But again, I would encourage you that--
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.620]   please don't send anything to Joan
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.540]   if you haven't run that through your own spellcheck
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.860]   and if you haven't run that through Grammarly.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.100]   Because Grammarly will catch almost everything, 98%
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.660]   of the things that we deal with.
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.220]   Grammarly will catch that and help
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.500]   you make the right adjustments.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.100]   Great question.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:27.900]   Where to submit exams.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.140]   So once you're done with the 44 essays,
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.900]   you're going to submit those exams to ACBC,
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.820]   and they have a grading process.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:38.940]   I think they have a grading fee of $100 or so.
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:44.500]   And they do have graders who work on your exams.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:51.620]   And generally, they send those back for two to three rewrites.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.540]   They have some real sharp people grading those exams.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:21:01.220]   I think one of the graders I have learned is very--
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.580]   I would have been intimidated to send my essays to him
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:07.060]   because I think he has some very high level
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.540]   theological education.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.420]   But just to encourage you that the graders want you to pass,
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.820]   but they're going to be fair.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:20.740]   They're not grading in order to--
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:21.740]   they're not your friend.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.820]   Can I say it that way?
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:27.660]   They're looking objectively as, do your essays make sense?
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.620]   And I think that's the value of this training,
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.820]   is you want someone who's not your friend
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.980]   to be able to look at your essays
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.180]   and to be able to say, either this makes sense
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:39.100]   or this doesn't make sense, and not
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.060]   to be afraid to hurt your feelings if what you're writing
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.780]   does not make sense.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.300]   So that's a whole process.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:49.100]   And it's a good process.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.220]   It really clarifies.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:54.140]   It's one thing to hear teaching and to say you agree with that.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:58.100]   It's another thing to write your own essay about that subject
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.460]   and to put it in your own words.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.060]   And it just is a great process to be
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:07.300]   able to own the things that you have been learning.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.420]   So the question is--
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.980]   an additional question is, will you
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.220]   be doing another course for the theology questions?
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:20.780]   So we did complete the 24 theology exam questions.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.540]   And all of that is available on YouTube.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.460]   And I'm still evaluating whether another live course will
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.540]   be necessary or if we can use those videos
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.500]   and do some discussion around those videos.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.340]   I'm still thinking through the right format
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.940]   for the next phase of the theology exam class.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:46.620]   But those videos are all available on the 24 theology
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.980]   exams.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.660]   If you're a motivated student and you
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.860]   want to double time and write the theology exam questions
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.260]   as well, all that material is available online.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:02.820]   But there will be some format of the theology questions
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:05.020]   offered in the future.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.700]   So great question.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.580]   On the Q&A, I have a question that I've read.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.620]   Is it better to do the theology exams first
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.780]   to have a better understanding to counsel from?
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:21.380]   Is it OK to do the counseling exams first?
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:24.980]   It really-- I've heard different things on that subject.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.500]   Great question.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.980]   I have heard-- some people love the counseling exams
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:33.140]   and they really hate writing the theology exams.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:37.820]   And other people are the exact opposite.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.660]   Some people love the theology exams
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.740]   and they really struggle with the counseling exams.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:46.660]   So it really depends on the person.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.020]   I've heard both arguments.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.420]   I've heard some people say it's better
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.180]   to do the counseling exams first because you
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.260]   get in the groove of writing.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:58.580]   And it's not as theologically intense,
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.020]   but you get in the routine of knowing
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.700]   how to write a page and a half essay
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.060]   and doing that every week.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:07.500]   And so that sort of helps you lead up to the theology exam
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.540]   questions.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:11.540]   I've heard the other argument of it's
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.540]   better to tackle the theology exams first
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:16.300]   because they're tough.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.660]   And so get the harder part over with.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.020]   And then everything else is downhill.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.220]   It really can be approached either way.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.100]   I just encourage you to--
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.340]   our students to jump in wherever you can.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.900]   And it really depends on the person.
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.380]   But it's a great question.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.540]   I don't know if there's a definitive answer.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:44.460]   I think there's good arguments either way.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.540]   Another question is the essay directions
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.980]   say write a paragraph or two on each part
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.220]   and identify each part.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.820]   That sounds like section headings.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.900]   Should those be on every essay or just
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:01.700]   on ones like today's with four clear parts?
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.700]   I'm trying to understand the section headings.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.660]   It's a good question.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.900]   I think what we're asking you to do is to write--
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:13.420]   this essay would probably be a good five paragraph essay.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:17.100]   The first paragraph would deal with just an introduction
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.740]   to why first sessions are important.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.660]   And then you have four paragraphs dealing
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.300]   with four of the key elements.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.340]   I don't think you need a new section
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.420]   heading on each paragraph.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:34.340]   I think you can have just five paragraphs for that essay.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.940]   And that would be fine.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.500]   And so I would encourage you to use the template that we sent
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.020]   out, the ACBC Counseling Exam template,
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:49.100]   and just where the text is to use that same formatting
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.180]   that they have in the template.
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.460]   And that would serve you well.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:57.060]   So that's a great question as well.
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:57.540]   Thank you.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.980]   One question is a suggested weekly schedule notes.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.460]   Mondays are for scripture.
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.380]   Do you mean general reading or specific
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.820]   targeted scriptural searching for the topic?
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:12.940]   We are doing that week.
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.100]   So great question.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.540]   I think that schedule that I put there probably
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.660]   pertains more to the theological essays, which
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:28.220]   each of the theology exam essays have about 10 to 15 key
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.980]   passages that students needed to think through.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.100]   And so I just put that as a suggested schedule
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.380]   to think through the scriptures on Monday
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.780]   and then read the theology works on Tuesday.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.360]   For the counseling exams, it's a little bit different
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:48.740]   because I don't think it's as heavy on reading
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.340]   the text of scripture.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:53.580]   I think you're going to be, for example, with this essay,
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.420]   looking at much of the material that we covered already
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.900]   in year one.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:02.780]   So feel free to follow a schedule that works for you.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.220]   That's just a suggested schedule of how
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.420]   you might be able to break down the writing
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.380]   process into six days.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.460]   And I've had my share of writer's block,
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:19.260]   believe me, staring at a blank screen for hours and despairing
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:19.900]   of your life.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.860]   And so it's helped me to try to break down the writing
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.100]   process into manageable, bite-sized pieces
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.640]   that you can follow each day.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.480]   Sometimes when you sit down and you're saying,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.020]   oh, I have to write a page and a half essay today,
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.780]   and it just seems so insurmountable that you just
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.980]   don't know where to start, I just
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.660]   try to always find ways of how do you break that down
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.900]   into bite-sized pieces.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.580]   So one day, you might want to read the suggested readings
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.060]   that were on page one of your handout.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.020]   The second day, you might want to take notes.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.740]   The third day, you might want to do a free write that's
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.940]   not your essay, but just a free write is usually--
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.540]   you're not paying attention to grammar.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.620]   You're not paying attention to punctuation.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.940]   You're just putting thoughts on a page.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.240]   And you're just trying to get words.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.660]   And then the next day, you're putting that into paragraphs.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:13.860]   And the next-- I'm always just trying to think through,
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:18.540]   how do you break that down into the next task?
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:24.100]   Because like many of you and like many writers,
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:29.540]   writer's block is one of the greatest struggles
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.060]   in writing an essay.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:35.860]   And sometimes, you just have to--
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:37.500]   when all else fails, and maybe it
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.900]   shouldn't be when all else fails.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.940]   It should be the first thing we do, but I have--
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:43.340]   I'm in a small group where I share--
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.660]   I have shared with my small group,
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:49.740]   I've got to write this thing for my certification
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.180]   or for my program.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:52.380]   I have writer's block.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.140]   Can you please pray me through this
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:58.180]   and pray me through the next page of my project?
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.780]   And just getting people to pray for you for the next page
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:04.420]   or the next paragraph sometimes is how you get through it.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:08.900]   And so that material there is just kind of my attempt
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.500]   to try to help you think through,
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   how do you break down this process
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:16.580]   into manageable bite-sized pieces
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.880]   so that you're not overwhelmed?
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:20.300]   You're not just sitting down on a Monday saying,
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.860]   I got to write a page and a half,
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.660]   and it just seems like too much of a task to do.
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.580]   So great question.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:34.540]   Think through your own process and your own scheduling,
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.940]   but do think through, how do you break that down
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:39.900]   into bite-sized pieces?
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.540]   Great question.
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:46.060]   The question is, are the template examples supposed
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:49.100]   to be in a foreign language?
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.880]   So yes, they have a really just kind of a--
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:53.820]   I don't know what it is.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.060]   It's some kind of gibberish, or I
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.860]   don't know if it's Latin or something.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.660]   That's just supposed to be a placeholder for text.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.780]   And you're supposed to go in and take that text
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:09.660]   and put your own wonderful language into that essay.
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.860]   So go ahead, and you can delete that foreign language
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.140]   and put your own essay writing in.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.940]   But yeah, that's a good question.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:19.820]   I think they just put that in there just
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:25.480]   to have filler text to show you what the text should look like.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.820]   And then a question, would you be
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:29.340]   willing to share the link for the handouts that correlate
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.180]   to your theology presentations?
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.460]   Great question.
[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.460]   Thank you for that.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:35.780]   I will send that out.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.740]   I have a Dropbox link that has all of the theology exam
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.740]   questions, and we can send that out and also send you
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:47.300]   the YouTube links if you want to access that.
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:50.940]   I think the first four essay topics,
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.060]   we still need to rerecord because we
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.060]   have technical issues.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:58.660]   But I think 20 of the essay exams for the theology exam
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:01.780]   should be available on YouTube.
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.900]   So thank you for that question as well.
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.420]   OK, wonderful.
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.300]   Any additional questions on the essay exams?
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:15.580]   I hope that's a good overview and orientation.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.660]   And I do hope that you'll read through that.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.420]   We are available.

[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.860]   So wonderful.

[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:07.900]   Thank you for joining us tonight.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.540]   I think it was a great start to the new year.

[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.780]   We'll be doing counseling exam number 2,
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:21.620]   which is dealing with the issue of involvement.
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.060]   And we hope to see you next Sunday.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:27.300]   So until then, God bless, and have a--
