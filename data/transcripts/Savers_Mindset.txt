[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.160]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.920]   It's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.640]   And in this episode, we want to talk about the savers mindset,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   whether we can all have it or whether it's just
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.460]   inherent or not.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.280]   So guess where we just came back from, Sydney?
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.440]   Where did we come back from?
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.360]   The mall?
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.100]   Actually, we did come back from the mall.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.920]   We went to some Panda Express.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.200]   I bought some sides, some sweet shrimp, and some Kung Pao
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   chicken and all that.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.480]   And the funny thing is, I had never gone to Panda Express
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.720]   until about eight months ago.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.320]   And now, every time I go, there are long lines.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760]   And I'm thinking to myself, wow, this place is good business.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   And the owners are billionaires, by the way.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.240]   And it's a private company.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.500]   And I realize, wow, the food tastes pretty good.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080]   And I'm an Asian person.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.960]   I've grown up-- I grew up in Asia.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.200]   I like good Asian food, great Asian food.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   So I would think, ah, Panda Express, whatever.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.020]   But I tried it.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.320]   I was like, eh, it's not bad.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   It's probably full of sugar and stuff like that.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.800]   But the main thing is that it's so cheap.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.300]   I basically bought enough to feed four of us for $38
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.360]   after tip and tax.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.860]   And I thought that was pretty good.
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.600]   What do you think?
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.480]   That's good pricing.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.600]   Food is crazy expensive today.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.680]   Crazy expensive.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   You were asking me to go buy some of the Korean barbecue
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.560]   stuff.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.680]   Because it's so good.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.280]   I mean, it's so good.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.320]   But it's so expensive.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.720]   It's like $18 to $20 for an entree, right, for one.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.880]   So if you multiply that by four, that's $80 versus $38
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.120]   I spent for four.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.280]   And luckily, it was closed.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.480]   Because that means I didn't have to spend the $18, $20
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.200]   to buy your entree.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.940]   You're going to have to eat Panda Express.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.440]   Ha, ha, ha.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.240]   It's all good.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.960]   So on the way home, guess where we also stopped by.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.680]   Oh, that's right.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.460]   We made a pit stop at the gas station.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.160]   The gas station.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.080]   Not any gas station.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.360]   Not the Shell gas station.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.680]   Not the Chevron gas station.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.240]   But the Speedway Express gas station.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   Which, for folks who don't know, at least I didn't really know,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   it's just the non-top-tier gasoline that's way cheaper.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.280]   So on our car, it's a Range Rover Sport 2015.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.080]   When you open up the lid to fill up the gas,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.720]   it says premium recommended.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.520]   So since we bought it in 2016, December,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.840]   I had always thought that premium meant anything
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.240]   above 87 octane.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   So 89 octane or 91 octane in California.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.760]   So given I want to save money, I was like, OK.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.240]   I'm just going to add 89 octane sometime.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.080]   Because it's more expensive than 87 octane.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   And what I didn't realize until 2024,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320]   when I started on this kick to save as much money as possible,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.960]   is that premium actually really means 91 octane or greater.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.600]   And there are parts of the country that have 93 octane.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.360]   Did you know that?
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.720]   93 in some place.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.680]   I did not know that.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.280]   Anyway, so for all this time, since December 2016,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.040]   I've been filling up Moose, our Range Rover Sport,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.640]   with premium 89 octane or 87 octane.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.320]   And all this time, the car has run just fine.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.600]   No knocking noises.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   No nothing.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.880]   And so I went on this deep dive.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.760]   And I thought, uh-oh.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.560]   Maybe this has been bad.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.160]   This is because my check engine light did go on.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.400]   But it went on for a completely different reason.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.280]   Because a PVC valve was cracked and broken.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   And it was allowing more air to flow into the engine
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.800]   than it was supposed to be.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.480]   So I went down this deep dive rabbit hole.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.720]   And so there are top-tier gasolines
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.520]   with supposedly twice the amount of, quote,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.440]   "detergents and additives" to clean up the fuel injectors
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.640]   and carbon deposits in your engine.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.920]   And then there are the non-top-tier gasoline,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   such as Speedway Express.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.000]   And I've been adding non-top-tier gasoline
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.640]   and 87 octane gasoline to a premium-recommended car
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.480]   for a long time.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.560]   And nothing has happened.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.080]   But the funny thing is, as I started to research
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.560]   more and more about how these top-tier gasolines
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.960]   have more additives, I started experiencing FOMO
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.160]   and the desire, thanks to, I think,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.720]   what is really mostly marketing,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.480]   to add more premium gasoline.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.800]   But I'm proud to say that I didn't.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.600]   Once again, I started to add the 87 octane Speedway Express
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.200]   gasoline, fill it up the tank, 23 gallons.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   And I saved myself $0.70 a gallon
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.520]   had I had gone to Chevron and paid for Supreme.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   And that's like $15, folks.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.720]   $15 on a tank of gas?
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.120]   I think that's worth the savings.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.880]   What do you think?
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.640]   I think so.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.600]   It seems like you've found a good compromise.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.360]   And how you have decided to manage the car,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   it's been doing great since we had it.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.280]   Very few problems overall.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.800]   So hey, it's a great, simple way to get some savings.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200]   Yeah, and the funny thing is, when
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.440]   I wrote this in my post on the three sneaky ways
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.120]   our expenses catch up to us, I had so much backlash
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.560]   from people who were ardently supporters
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.160]   of fueling top-tier gas, from mechanics to just enthusiasts.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   But really, none of us, unless we're driving F1 car racers,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.720]   or we have like, I don't know, 911 Turbo or a Lamborghini,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.320]   none of us really need this super high octane gas,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   premium gas.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.400]   I don't think the vast majority of us can tell the difference.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.560]   Can you tell the difference?
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.760]   I can't tell the difference.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.880]   But again, you do most of the driving.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   Maybe some of these car enthusiasts,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   they're driving a lot of mileage per year
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.120]   and being on the highway a lot.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.520]   So maybe they can tell a little bit.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.040]   But I think based on the type and amount of driving
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.560]   that we do as a family, I think it's fine.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.360]   Yeah, I mean, in the city, the speed limit
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.840]   is like 25 to 35 miles per hour.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.560]   So maybe you drive 30 to 40 miles an hour max in the city.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.440]   You don't need high-performance gas.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.160]   And the thing is, if you really, really
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.720]   are concerned about carbon deposits building up,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.040]   you can just buy a bottle of Tecron on Amazon for like $18
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.760]   and then dump it in your tank with up to, what,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.960]   20 gallons of fuel.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.920]   That's what they recommend.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   And then do that every single oil change, every 5,000
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.760]   to maybe 10,000 miles, and you're probably good to go.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.200]   That's a great compromise.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.920]   Yeah, it's a decent compromise.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.640]   So it is interesting that once I started
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.480]   doing the deep dive on, quote, "the better quality fuels,"
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.440]   I was like, oh, I should do that too.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   And it just really, I think, shows what marketing and FOMO
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000]   can do to your budget.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.440]   And this realization also made me
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.600]   want to get into this saver's mindset, the frugal mindset,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.720]   I think, that many of us who are practicing saving and investing
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.440]   and trying to achieve financial independence sooner rather
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.520]   than later have been doing or adopting for a while.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.840]   Do you have the frugal mindset?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.520]   I do.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.800]   And I think especially this year, with us moving and having
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.480]   a big lifestyle change and a shift in how our finances are
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.840]   structured, I think we've both been really looking at ways
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.360]   to save money again, and we feel great about it.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   Why don't you tell the listeners about your recent experience
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   with your jacket?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.240]   My jacket.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.640]   Tell them the jacket story.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.760]   Well, it's not a big story, but the point
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.800]   is I had not been thinking from a "safe first"
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   mentality for a while until we bought this house.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   Because after we bought the house in 2023,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.840]   cash flow became tight.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.800]   And with all these capital calls from the private investment
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.880]   funds that we do in artificial intelligence, venture capital,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.200]   and so forth, we were really short on--
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.480]   I think we were literally living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.520]   counting our dollars and wondering
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   how we're going to allocate money to these capital calls
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.360]   and pay for our higher expenses now.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.240]   And so the saver's mindset really kicked in.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.640]   And it hadn't kicked in before because we've always
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.360]   adopted this pay yourself first, where you take money out
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   of your paycheck first before you can even see your money
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.320]   and just invest it in your solo 401(k), 401(k), IRA,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.880]   taxable investments, and so forth.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.680]   So with the saver's mindset, suddenly everything
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.160]   started looking like a savings opportunity to me.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.880]   So one was gas, right?
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.960]   Second was this Nike jacket that I've
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.160]   owned for two years, maybe three years.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.200]   I wear it almost every other day.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.680]   The parents at my school probably
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.480]   see me wearing the same thing every other--
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.280]   it's almost like a uniform, but it's just warm, long sleeve.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's got zipper pockets, which I need.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.960]   And the zipper finally broke.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.160]   It was like a two-way zipper that just finally
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   stopped working.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   And I was like, OK, let's go online
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.320]   and see how much these jackets cost.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   And they cost like $110 to $120 after tax.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   And because I have the saver's mindset now,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.480]   I was thinking, well, is there a better way
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.920]   to do this to save money?
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.840]   And we did find a way.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.560]   We went to the local dry cleaning store.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.920]   Then they said they could fix it.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.760]   I was hoping they would fix it for like $18,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   but I guess due to inflation and labor, they said $28.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.600]   And since I dropped you off to go investigate,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.360]   I just said, well--
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.400]   I texted you back, said, OK, fine, let's do it for $28.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.240]   So there you go.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.720]   I saved about $90.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.200]   And I plan to wear this jacket for years
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.960]   to come because I decided to save.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.520]   Yeah, I think that was a great idea because even before we
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.080]   moved, I remember you were thinking
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.560]   about replacing your jacket because the zipper was always
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.080]   starting to fray at that point.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.160]   And you were getting a little frustrated with it.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.600]   And then you said, well, I'll wait.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.860]   I'll think about it after we move.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.520]   And then, yeah, the zipper finally just completely
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.380]   fell apart and wouldn't work at all.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.040]   And then you came up with the idea, hey,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.360]   let's see if we can have someone just replace the zipper
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.000]   because the rest of the jacket was fine.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.640]   And it worked out quite well.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.320]   When you got it, it was just as good, wouldn't you say?
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.400]   Looks good enough.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.200]   I mean, it's good enough, in my opinion.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.080]   And the other thing is I made a promise
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   not to buy anything for the remainder of 2023
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.640]   after we purchased the house.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.720]   And I didn't buy anything.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.400]   So I was like, OK, well, yeah, I was tempted to buy,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   but I didn't buy it.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.760]   And I made another promise for 2024
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.560]   not to buy anything as well.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.600]   So one of the things that I buy most frequently,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.160]   like a material item, are shoes.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.440]   Because I go through tennis shoes, pickleball shoes,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.240]   I would say every four to six months where the tread just
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.720]   wears flat and it becomes slippery and, frankly,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.700]   not that safe to play in, especially if the court is
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.520]   a little bit wet, right?
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.560]   And so shoes are $100--
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.520]   well, they're probably like $80 to $160.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.640]   And that's just the way it is, right?
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.880]   That's the cost of playing a sport often.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.340]   And so I was going to go buy shoes.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.440]   I love shoes, by the way.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.720]   And they're not that expensive.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.480]   I remember growing up as a kid, I'd
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.120]   love all the Michael Jordan shoes.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.840]   My favorite version is, I think, the Jordan 4s, the Fires.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.620]   I love the Agassi shoes from Nike.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.080]   But they were always too expensive.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.900]   So I always got hand-me-down shoes.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.280]   And I realized, OK, I'm trying to save money.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.880]   I promise not to buy anything.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.760]   Well, I actually do have these old shoes
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.240]   that I bought two, three, five, six, seven years ago that I
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.880]   just kept as collector's items in my boxes, frankly.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.040]   And I thought, you know what?
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.240]   I'm finally going to wear these shoes because I have a reason.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.000]   I want to save money.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And I want to declutter.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.560]   So I thought that was pretty positive.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.280]   Definitely.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.640]   There's so many ways to simplify and save
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.200]   if you have the motivation to do it.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.440]   And for example, one thing I started doing differently
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.360]   with all of our kids' stuff-- because as parents,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.320]   you go through a lot of things with kids--
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.660]   toys, books, clothes, shoes.
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.680]   I used to take all of the items that our son had grown up,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.040]   that our daughter wouldn't use, and that she'd outgrown
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.320]   and wouldn't use, and I would just donate everything
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.120]   to charity.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   But what I realized is I could try and sell a lot of it
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.200]   instead.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.560]   So now I have a local store where
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   I go, and I bring one or two bags of things
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.620]   every couple months.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.240]   And they'll look through it, and they'll
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.000]   decide what they're going to try to consign for me
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.320]   and what they're not going to take.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.020]   And anything they don't take, I just go ahead and donate it
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.000]   straight away.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.860]   But it's been a great way to just earn some extra money
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.080]   for new things that the kids need or groceries.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.240]   So just little things do add up over time.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.680]   Yeah, it's a two-for-one special.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.720]   You declutter, you sell stuff, and you make money.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.960]   And that's great.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.280]   And the other thing is we're using our son's old clothes,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   I've noticed, often now.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.880]   And our daughter is using it now.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.320]   Our younger daughter is using it, the pajamas especially,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.240]   right, and just like the long-sleeve shirts.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.480]   Yeah, we've been able to reuse a lot of stuff.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.040]   Yeah, and clothing for kids, growing young kids,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.640]   is probably one of the most common recurring expenses
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.680]   because they grow so fast, especially shoes, right?
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.360]   I don't know, how are we going to make his shoes last longer?
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.720]   He seems to burn through them every two to three months.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.520]   Yeah, he goes through shoes quickly because he runs a lot.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   And I think maybe it's just the shoe itself that just
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.440]   can't last that long.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.600]   I don't know, he's definitely gone through shoes quickly
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.800]   that I can't hand down because they'll end up
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.600]   with holes in them and there's no tread left whatsoever.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.680]   But at least we're maximizing it too.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.840]   It's full potential, put it that way.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.440]   So another sneaky expense was the subscription expenses,
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.480]   right?
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.800]   I had signed up a couple of years ago for Apple TV
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.480]   because there was a promotion and then I
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.320]   wanted to watch Severance.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.200]   It was a great show, it's like dystopian future.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.120]   I love dystopian crazy stuff, Handmaid's Tale, all that stuff.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.280]   And I loved watching it for the first season
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.960]   and I was expecting the second season to come out,
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.320]   but it never came out, partially due to the writer's strike,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.480]   possibly because Ben Stiller, the producer,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.520]   decided to take a break, I don't know.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.480]   So I went for one whole year in 2023
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.840]   paying for Apple TV subscription without ever watching
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.640]   a single show.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.180]   And so once that Savers mindset kicked in, I said,
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.600]   you know what, I'm going to cancel
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.000]   that subscription, $9.99, right?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.800]   And save $10 a month.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.360]   And I canceled it too late.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   I canceled it, I guess, at the beginning of March 2024,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.400]   so I had another full month to watch Apple TV.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.680]   And the funny thing that happened
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.920]   was I decided to maximize my Apple TV usage
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.400]   and watch something.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.960]   And I ended up watching For All Mankind all four seasons.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.760]   And it was an incredible show that I
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.920]   think everybody should watch.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.640]   Unbelievable family story, full of drama.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.520]   You cheer for people.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.240]   Wonderful, wonderful show.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.760]   And now I'm going to finish watching Ted Lasso,
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.880]   I guess, the three seasons.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.040]   It's pretty good, it's pretty funny.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.400]   So I'm trying to get my money's worth
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.120]   after not using it at all in 2023,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.440]   but that subscription is going to be canceled as well.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.200]   Do you have any subscriptions that you forgot about
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.800]   that you should cancel?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.080]   - Yes, those auto renewal subscriptions are so sneaky.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.640]   I had one for a photo app that I used
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.560]   when our son was young and I had more time,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.600]   where it was called something like one second a day,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.400]   where you'd go through your photo library
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.280]   and you'd pick a photo or a video each day
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.560]   and capture one or two seconds from that day.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.160]   And then it all gets stitched together
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.640]   into a big video file at the end of the year
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.440]   or whatever timeline you want for your project.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.400]   And I was so addicted to this in the beginning
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.800]   and I did it for at least two,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.400]   maybe two and a half, three years.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.440]   And then I just forgot about it because life got busy.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.000]   And initially it was free,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.880]   but then they started charging for it.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.080]   And I forgot about it.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.160]   And then one day I was going through my subscript,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.740]   my list of subscriptions on my phone.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.200]   And I said, oh my gosh, why do I still,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.360]   why am I still paying for this
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.840]   when I'm not using it anymore?
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.060]   I don't have any time.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.280]   So I quickly canceled that, turned off the auto renew,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.480]   but yes, auto renewal subscriptions are sneaky.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.660]   So definitely check them regularly
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.200]   and see what you're paying for
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.560]   that you aren't using anymore
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.280]   and just cancel it, get rid of it.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.520]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.960]   I think one of the final sneaky expenses
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   that we all go through is just food.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.320]   We have to eat every single day, right?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.800]   I remember the CEO of some, I think cereal company.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.160]   He said, well, stop complaining about inflation
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.780]   and food costs and start eating cereal for dinner instead.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.400]   And then that was, everybody was pissed off about that.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.840]   But it's interesting because every time we go
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.400]   to the grocery store, I'm always negatively surprised,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.420]   like shocked in a bad way about the bill at the end.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.520]   'Cause I remember in the past we'd buy groceries
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.080]   for under $100 per trip.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.400]   And now it's like 160, I don't know, sometimes 200,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   but that $200 bill was because we bought some Toro sashimi
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.000]   from the Japanese supermarket, which was on sale
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.140]   for like, I don't know, $50 pounds, something like that.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.640]   I don't remember.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.580]   But food, food is interesting because personally
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.820]   I have always struggled with my weight.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.220]   I play a lot of sports.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.900]   So every single pound that I pack on is really noticeable
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.180]   in terms of performance because it just slows me down
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.140]   or it weighs on my knees and stuff.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.820]   And so I'm trying to stay in shape
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.380]   and I'm trying to get down to that 155
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.440]   to 158 pound ideal weight for someone 5'10.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.160]   But no matter how hard I try, I can't.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.860]   I'm always stuck at like 168 and I got to like 170,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.900]   maybe like five during the pandemic.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.660]   It was pretty tough.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.740]   So food expenses.
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.740]   The good thing about rising food expenses
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.020]   is I am definitely eating less food.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.500]   I would say 15%, maybe 20% less food.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.460]   Well, what do you think?
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.400]   - Yes, food is expensive.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.200]   I've been doing most of the grocery shopping for us
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.580]   for a while and yes, I've seen prices get higher and higher
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.900]   over the last several years, especially.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.900]   And it's frustrating,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.740]   but you just have to find better ways to save.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   And during the pandemic, we heavily relied on food delivery
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.700]   to the point where we were just spending
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.460]   way, way, way too much.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.620]   And we've really cut back on that
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.660]   and I've increased my contributions to cooking.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.640]   Not something I love, but it's actually a good way
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.880]   to de-stress if I've planned it out properly
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.960]   and I have enough time
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.800]   and I have all the ingredients on hand.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.360]   And one of the things that I've made
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.600]   that you might laugh about is lasagna,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.680]   which is actually what I'm gonna cook tonight.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   And very simple, but it will feed us for four days sometimes
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.920]   if we stretch in salads or sandwiches
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.540]   or other things in between.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.640]   But yeah, by that fourth day,
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.440]   I know you especially like, "I can't eat any more lasagna.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.680]   I'm so sick of it."
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.640]   But hey, it's a great way to save making big meals
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.480]   that you can stretch.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.080]   And if after the second day,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.720]   you just can't take it anymore, freeze it.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.240]   A lot of things do really great if you freeze them.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.560]   - Yeah, someone was, I was just reading somewhere.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.200]   The food is not supposed to taste good.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.160]   If it tastes good, it's not good for you.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   And I thought about that for a little bit
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.880]   and it might be true because if it tastes so good,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.800]   it's probably like processed food, sugar, all that,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.880]   which we all know is bad for us
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.960]   and we should all try to cut down.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.800]   And learning how to eat the same thing over and over again,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.200]   like maybe like military
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.440]   or like a strict dorm room or something,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.140]   I think that's a good discipline to have.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.080]   And that's some discipline that I have failed
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.320]   to work at for decades now.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.600]   We're spoiled here in San Francisco,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.460]   which is I think one of the top three cities
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.100]   with the best food.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.040]   And now with the invention of food delivery,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.340]   grocery delivery,
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.200]   it just becomes so easy to order stuff that we want.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.120]   I remember I was ordering like Bob's Donuts,
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.640]   but you know, the cronuts like once a week.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.280]   And then I was ordering boba tea,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.340]   which is like 1000 calories per large cup once a week.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.160]   And then, you know, oh, I gained five pounds.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.800]   Well, why do you think that is or was
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.040]   because I was so easily ordering food
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.620]   that I didn't need to consume.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.460]   - I'll add to that.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.660]   There is a fun reality show out there on Netflix
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.540]   that's all about making new things with leftovers.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.620]   So if you like to cook, if you like reality TV,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.140]   look it up on Netflix.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.780]   Sorry, I forgot the name of it.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.180]   But it's a fun way to see how creative you can be
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.620]   and how totally different you can make a dish
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.980]   just based on what you have leftover in the fridge.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.840]   And that helps reduce waste
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   and it gives you something fun to do at the same time.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.160]   - Sounds like a good idea.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.680]   In conclusion, do you think we're born
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.980]   with a saver's mindset
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.800]   or do we have to cultivate it and develop it?
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.720]   - I would say it's a bit of both
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.480]   just based on my own experience.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.320]   What do you think?
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   - I think it is more about how you're brought up,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.640]   not so much genetic.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.520]   I think it's more like 70% nurture, like your environment.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.260]   Because I grew up with very frugal parents.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.540]   My dad famously told me and I'll never forget it
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.400]   while I was in Malaysia in middle school,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.640]   don't order that drink, order water with a lemon.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.340]   Why do you wanna spend so much money on drink?
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.860]   High margin business or product, save money.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.140]   And so ever since he taught me that,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.200]   I have been pretty frugal since middle school.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.140]   And I try to look at things
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.960]   and I try to figure out
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.080]   whether there's a better alternative on the cost.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.040]   Or I like to go window shopping
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.200]   and then when I don't buy anything, I feel great actually.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.800]   I feel great that I saved money by not buying anything
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.560]   even though I didn't spend anything in the first place.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.720]   And so I grew up with this frugal mindset
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.040]   that has helped me.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.560]   First apartment I got out of college
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.760]   was a studio apartment
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.860]   that was shared with my high school friend.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.360]   And I think if I didn't have that frugal mindset
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.840]   since the beginning, I wouldn't have done that.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.200]   I would have got a studio for myself
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.960]   or maybe got a one bedroom apartment or something.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.320]   And so this frugality has stuck with me
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.680]   ever since middle school.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   So that's over 32 years now, 33 years.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.920]   And I think it's gonna continue.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.880]   And I think the good thing about that
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   is that it spreads to you, our closest friends and family.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.160]   And I hope it'll spread to our children
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.560]   who see that we don't waste our money as well.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.920]   - For sure, definitely.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.120]   - All right, well, for all of y'all who wanna save money,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.720]   look at your expenses,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.080]   have a sit down with your significant other every week
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.240]   or every month when you get those bills
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.440]   and go through line item by line item what you can cut
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.840]   because I'm sure, I'm sure there's something you can cut.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.040]   Overtime is just a natural occurrence to buy more things,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.000]   get more subscriptions
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.520]   and just to be a little bit more wasteful
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.320]   and not really as efficient as we can be with our money.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.880]   And I'm really appreciative of a lot of the commenters
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.960]   who really criticized my budget that I had in,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.480]   I thought, what was that post?
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   There's one post that I'll link in the show notes
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.800]   where I put a fictitious but realistic,
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   it's not exactly ours,
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.920]   but it's pretty close budget on a household
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.400]   that's spending $280,000 or thereabouts a year.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.080]   And that's a lot of money.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.200]   And I wanted to go through line item by line item
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.840]   and I got so much pushback as normal, right?
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.520]   Because anybody who doesn't spend that much money
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.880]   will find that amount of money
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.800]   to be a little bit ridiculous.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.120]   And so I really appreciate that criticism and feedback
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   because it helped motivate me to look at where we can cut.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.920]   So I thank you.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.840]   So keep that criticism coming,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.600]   shine a light on things that I'm not doing
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.800]   that is congruent with my thoughts or actions.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.320]   Just point these things out.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.520]   I think it really helps me.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.000]   And if you want me to point things out
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.080]   that you're doing that you could optimize,
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.920]   let me know as well.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.040]   I think we can all learn from each other.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   So if you enjoy this podcast,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.240]   we'd love a positive review, share and subscribe.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.800]   These reviews, we read them all.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.360]   They keep us going.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   You know, we don't make any money from these podcasts.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.000]   We just do this out of the labor of love
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.440]   and it's really fun to do on occasion.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.280]   And if you wanna subscribe
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.320]   to the Financial Samurai newsletter,
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.520]   go to financialsamurai.com/news.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.040]   This way, I think it'll help you increase your probability
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.440]   of achieving financial independence sooner
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.560]   rather than later.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.400]   Thanks so much.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.240]   Bye everyone.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.680]   (upbeat music)
