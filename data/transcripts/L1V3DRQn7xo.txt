[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   And I think that's the other biggest reason why people don't buy businesses, because you
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.960]   feel like, "I don't want to take my eye off podcasting in my business and everything that's
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.960]   working right now.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.960]   It's a distraction."
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.400]   And that is true often if you feel like you're playing, let's call it a level one, like a
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.920]   level six game, a really high level game.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.800]   But if you're at a job you don't love, if you're making the same amount of money continuously,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.160]   I think you should spend at least 90 days learning how to acquire things because then
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.960]   you'll never have to do something just for the money again.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.480]   You can do it if you want to.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.360]   I don't think everybody should go and be a laundromat owner forever, and that's their
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.960]   highest and best use.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.800]   But I think if you have assets behind you, then you get to choose.
