[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Listen, you have to know something here.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Everybody here, any human being in this area, in all the world,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   not against peace. Everybody likes life.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Even Hamas in Gaza, they like life, they like peace.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   But peace is not like what you want.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   If I want to buy something from you, if I get it for your price,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and I am happy for your things, I will buy it.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   So our situation here, what's going on with the Israelis,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   we are not against Israel as people, Jews.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We are against occupation.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   If you remember what's happened with Russia and Ukraine,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   look, one year Russia, they have a problem.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   They are afraid from NATO come close to them.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   They are going inside Ukraine.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   All the world and all the army of the world against Russia.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   How come I am refugee in my land?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Why I lost my house?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Did I make something for Israel?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Did Hitler was my cousin?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Did I make anything for the Jews in the world?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Me and my family and the Palestinians?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Do you have hope for peace?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   My age is 50 years. I have seven kids.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   No hope. If I told I have hope, I am Jew.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And if you want to say the truth, there is no justice in the world.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   If you are strong, everybody afraid from you.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   If you are not, everybody kill you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   They make you like this by your foot.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   That's what's happened.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   There is no peace, my friend.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   If you want to see the peace, come to our camp where I live.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You will cry. You will cry. You see our peace.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What are the conditions like in the camp?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   My friend, they are waiting for water.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Water, you know what's mean water?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   In Europe, the dog, he live in good condition.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Dog, animals.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   How come a human being no have water? Water to drink.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I asked you about anger. What about love?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Do you have love in your heart?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Well, I love everybody. Even the Jews.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   They kill us. They destroyed our houses.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I'm not look to fight. I'm not look to kill.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I am against violence.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   We love your kids to live in good condition.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The Israeli side and the Palestinian.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We are against violence. We don't want to see more blood.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We want to destroy this world.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You come to me, I come to you. That's it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That's my hope.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Thank you, my brother. Thank you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You are Spanish.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   How are you?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Spanish.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hello, Colombia. I like Colombia. How are you?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hello, friends.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I recently traveled to the West Bank and spoke with many Palestinian people there.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   From all walks of life.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   There was anger and there was hope.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   In their voice, in their eyes, in their stories.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In ways that I probably can't express with words.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But I wanted to begin to experience directly.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Most conversations were offline, but a few were on camera.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I include those latter ones here in this video.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm not a journalist, nor a documentary filmmaker.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Just a fellow human being.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Trying to understand the struggles and the beauty of other people.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And I just sometimes may bring a camera along.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So I ask for your forgiveness if I fall short of what I could have done with this opportunity.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I work hard to improve.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And I will do many more videos like these.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I love you all.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So I think a lot of people would be surprised to see a Palestinian who is a Christian.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yes.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Is there a tension in that?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Can you explain what it's like to be you?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yes.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Actually, because I've been to America once when I was there.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I said that I'm Palestinian Christian.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And they, "How come you are Palestinian Christians?"
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   They don't know that in Palestine there are Christian people.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Palestinian Christians have existed since Jesus was born in here.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And the place that I live in it, it's 200 years old.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And it was my grand-grandfather who lived in this.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And my grandfather and my father and me in the same house.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   In this area, in Palestine especially, you can see Christians and Muslims together living side by side.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And as neighbors.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   As we go to the universities together.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   We work together.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   We do everything together.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   What aspects of life has made difficult here because of the tension between Israel and Palestine?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yes.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Actually, since Jesus was born, it was occupied by many.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Till now, occupation after occupation.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We passed Palestine through the Turkish, the British, Egyptian, Jordanian.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And that was the last is the Israeli.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So there's quite a bit of tension between the various religions here.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yes.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   What gives you hope for the future?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That's right.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Because, you know, Christianity, Muslims, and Judaism.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And which means that all praise the Lord.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   This makes me feel very happy.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Because I'm not a judge to judge the other religions.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I'm just praying.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And God will judge everyone as what he believes.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But the most important thing between the three major religions is just to have most important to have love.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   First of all, how long have you lived here?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   My father was second generation.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Refugee, I'm a third generation.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   My grandfather first, he lived in 1948.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   What does it mean to be a refugee?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Refugee, that's a long story.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You know, Palestinians, they became refugees in 1948.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   When, you know, they lost their homeland, they became refugees.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   A lot of them live in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and everywhere in Palestine.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You know, Palestinians get divided to West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Jordan Valley.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Do you have hope for peace in the region?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Of course, I do have hope because nothing lasts forever.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You know, you know what that means?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Nothing lasts forever.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We have a lot of people.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   We are not alone in the world.

[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   We are not alone in the world.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We are not alone in the world.
