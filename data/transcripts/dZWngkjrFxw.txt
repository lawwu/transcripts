[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Listen, you have to know something.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Everybody here, any human being in this area, in all the world,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   is not against peace. Everybody likes life.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Even Hamas in Gaza, they like life, they like peace.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   But peace is not like what you want.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   If I want to buy something from you, if I agree for your price,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and I am happy for your things, I will buy it.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So our situation here, what's going on with the Israelis, we are not against Israel as people, Jews.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We are against occupation.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   You remember what's happening with Russia and Ukraine.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Look, one year Russia, they have a problem.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   They are afraid from NATO, come close to, they are going inside Ukraine.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   All the world, and all the arming of the world against Russia.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I am a refugee in my land. Why I lost my house?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Did I make something for Israel?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Did my, Hitler was my cousin.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Did I make anything for the Jews in the world?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Me and my family and the Palestinians.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Do you have hope for peace?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   My age is 50 years. I have seven kids.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   No hope. If I told I have hope, I am a joke.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And if you want to say the truth, there is no justice in the world.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   If you are strong, everybody afraid from you.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   If you are not, everybody kill you.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They make you like this by your foot.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   That's what's happening.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   There is no peace, my friend.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   If you want to see the peace, come to our camp where I live.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You will cry. You will cry, you see our peace.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What are the conditions like in the camp?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   My friend, they waiting for water, water, you know what's mean water?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   In Europe, the dog, he live in good condition.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Dog, animals.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   How come a human being don't have water, water to drink?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I asked you about anger. What about love?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You got love in your heart?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Well, I love everybody.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Even the Jews, they kill us.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   They destroyed our houses.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I'm not look to fight. I'm not look to kill.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I am against violence.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   We love your kids to live in good condition.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The Israeli side and the Palestinian.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We are against violence. We don't want to see more blood.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We want to destroy this wall.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You come to me, I come to you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That's it. That's my hope.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Thank you, my brother.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   My English not so nice.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   No, it's pretty good.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Spanish.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Good?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Spanish.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hola, Colombia. Arriba Colombia.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   How are you, Colombia?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   How are you? All good?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hello, friends.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I recently traveled to the West Bank and spoke with many Palestinian people there.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   From all walks of life.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   There was anger and there was hope.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   In their voice, in their eyes, in their stories.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In ways that I probably can't express with words.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But I wanted to begin to experience directly.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Most conversations were offline, but a few were on camera.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I include those latter ones here in this video.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'm not a journalist nor a documentary filmmaker.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Just a fellow human being.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Trying to understand the struggles and the beauty of other people.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And I just sometimes may bring a camera along.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So I ask for your forgiveness if I fall short of what I could have done with this opportunity.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I will work hard to improve.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And I will do many more videos like these.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I love you all.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So I think a lot of people would be surprised to see a Palestinian who's a Christian.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yes.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Is there a tension in that?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Can you explain what it's like to be you?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yes.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Actually, because I've been to America once when I was there.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I said that I'm a Palestinian Christian.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And they asked, "How come you are a Palestinian Christian?"
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   They don't know that in Palestine there are Christian people.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Palestinian Christians have existed since Jesus was born.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   The house that I live in, it's 200 years old.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And it was my grand-grandfather who lived in this.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And my grandfather and my father and me in the same house.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   In this area, in Palestine especially, you can see Christians and Muslims together.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Living side by side.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And as neighbors.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   As we go to the universities together.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   We work together.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   We do everything together.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   What aspects of life has made it difficult here because of the tension between Israel and Palestine?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yes.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Actually, since Jesus was born, it was occupied by many.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Till now, occupation after occupation.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We passed Palestine through the Turkish, the British, Egyptian, Jordanian.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And that was the last is Israel.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So there's quite a bit of tension between the various religions here.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yes.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   What gives you hope for the future?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That's right.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Because, you know, Christianity, Muslims, and Judaism.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And which means that all praise the Lord.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   This makes me feel very happy.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Because I'm not a judge to judge the other religions.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I'm just praying.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And God will judge everyone as what he believes.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But the most important thing between the three major religions is just to have most important, to have love.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   First of all, how long have you lived here?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   My father was a second generation refugee.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I'm a third generation.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   My grandfather first lived in 1948.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What does it mean to be a refugee?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Refugee, that's a long story.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You know, Palestinians, they became refugees in 1948 when, you know, they lost their homeland.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   They became refugees.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   A lot of them live in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and everywhere in Palestine.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You know, Palestine is getting divided.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Jordan Valley.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Do you have hope for peace in the region?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Of course, I do have hope because nothing lasts forever.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You know, you know what that means?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Nothing lasts forever.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We are not alone.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We have a lot of solidarity from the Jewish community, from the Christian community, from the whole world.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But that's something to do with the governments and politicians.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   They are, you know, trying to control over.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   One state, equal rights, equal citizens, because Jews, Christians, and Muslims,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   they have always lived together, during the British Mandate, during the Ottoman's time, for decades.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   The only hope for people to live peacefully together, it's related to one word, which is occupation.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   If occupation ends, there's no reason for Palestinians to fight.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There's no reason for Palestinians to throw rockets.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But people, I think they have a legitimate right to resist.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Palestinian people, in general, they are nice people, not what the media says about us.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You know, it's crazy, when you resist, they call you a terrorist.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It's a crazy world that we live in.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We are in the 21st century and we're still occupied.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So one day, that's why, again, like I started saying...
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Nothing lasts forever?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Exactly. Eventually, this occupation will end.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And I do believe that history is repeating itself, but it seems to me, people, they didn't learn from the history, you know?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Right?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   People who get the power, they want to just keep going on, you know?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   But at least we are not alone in this damn world.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   How long have you lived here?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I lived in this city, I was born in this city, since I was born until now, I grew up in this town.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   There are a lot of people that have anger towards Israel, hate towards Israel.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I will give you an example.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Like, if someone comes to fight your family, and to enter your home, you will stand closing your hand.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   If someone killed your brother, killed your father, you will be as sober as crazy.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   This is what's happened to Palestine.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   A lot of Palestinians were killed for no reason.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   What gives you hope about the future here?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Look, let me tell you something.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   The situation is getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Today, they close all over around Bethlehem because something happened.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   There's a fight between Palestine and Israel.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And if you go all over around the city, all the entrance of the city is closed.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Second thing I want to tell you is something.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I don't like politics so much.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Because, you know, in the end we are all human.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It doesn't matter if you are Palestinian or Israeli or Russian or American.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It doesn't matter what your religion is, Christian, Muslim, Jew.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   In the end, we are all human.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   What we want, we want just peace.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   We want to live in peace.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   We don't want any more fight.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We want to have our freedom to travel, to go wherever we want.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And that's it.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Palestinian scarf.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Speed me.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It looks good.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   What's... tell us about the coffee.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I make very good coffee and very good tea.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I make the tea with mint, cinnamon, sage, thyme, ginger, coriander, rosemary, lemon, two seeds of cardamom and rose.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   This is for me.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   This is for his job.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   This is very good for working in the night.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   You know what does it mean?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yes, yes I know what it means.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   King of the jungle.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Again.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   [End of Audio]
