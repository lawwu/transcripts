[00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:14.640]   aspicts of life is made difficult here because of the tension between Israel and Palestine? Yes. Actually, since Jeeva was born in the year 2000, we've been living here for 200 years. And it was my grand-grandfather who lived in this, and my grandfather and my father and me in the same house in this area, in Palestine especially. We can see Christians and Muslims together living side by side, and as neighbours. As we go to the universities together, we walk together, we do everything together.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.580]   So, there's quite a bit of tension between the various religions here. Yes. What gives you hope for the future? That's right.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:12.520]   Yes, because, you know, Christianity, Muslims and Judaism, and which is, means that all praise the Lord. This makes me feel very happy. Because I'm not a judge to judge the other religions. I'm just praying and God will judge everyone as what he believes. But the most important thing between the three major religions is just to have the right to be a believer.

[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:42.460]  , to have love.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.460]   First of all, how long have you lived here?
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.460]   My father was a second generation refugee. I'm a third generation. My grandfather first lived in 1948. What does it mean to be a refugee? Refugee, that's a long story. You know, Palestinians that became a refugee in 1948 when they lost their homeland, they became refugees. A lot of them live in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and everywhere in Palestine. You know, Palestinians get divided. West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, Jordan Valley. Do you have hope for peace in the region?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:06:12.400]   Of course, I do have hope because nothing lasts forever. You know, you know what that means? Nothing lasts forever. We are not alone. We have a lot of solidarity from the Jewish community, from the Christian community, from the whole world. But something that's something to do with the government and politicians. They are, you know, trying to control over. One state equal right, equal system because Jewish, Christians and Muslims, they have always lived together during the British mandate, during the Ottoman time for decades. The only hope for people to live peacefully together, it's related to one word, which is occupation.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   It's the only hope for people to live peacefully together, it's related to one word, which is occupation.

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:51.380]   People who get the power, they want to just keep going on, you know.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.280]   But at least we are not alone in this damn world.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.780]   How long have you lived here?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.080]   I lived in this city. I was born in this city. Since I was born until now, I grew up in this town.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.980]   There are a lot of people that have anger towards Israel, hate towards Israel.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.280]   I will give you an example. Like if someone came to fight your family,
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   I would have a lot of anger towards Israel, hate towards Israel.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   I would have a lot of anger towards Israel, hate towards Israel.
