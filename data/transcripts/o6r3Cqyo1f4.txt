[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   You get the results of what you repeatedly do.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.360]   You eat chips and nachos and Mai Tais every day,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.920]   you're going to get overweight.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.640]   You jog every single day, you're going to lose weight.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.040]   You spend 15 minutes every day
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.260]   looking into your significant other's eyes,
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.960]   having a real conversation,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.560]   you're going to have a better relationship.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600]   You avoid them, you're gonna have a bad one, right?
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.260]   So there are certain things in life
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.320]   that give us the result of life that we want.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.000]   So all we need to do to be successful in anything,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.980]   I really believe this, is like know where you want to go,
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.120]   know what things are going to get you there.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520]   And when I say things, I mean the habits, the traits,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.240]   the systems, track those things
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.040]   and get accountability on it.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120]   If it's a group of guys getting accountability together,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.960]   is it hiring a performance coach?
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.320]   Whatever that is, get the accountability.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.920]   So know where you're going,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040]   figure out what the steps are needed to get there,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.520]   track it so you can be aware of you getting there
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.400]   or not getting there,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.640]   and then get accountability
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.240]   so you can hack your self-discipline.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.000]   You can accomplish anything, anything by doing that.
