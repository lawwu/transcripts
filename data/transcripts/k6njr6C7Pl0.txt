[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020]   You want to know my fail safe for crashing a party?
[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.760]   This worked every time and it never doesn't work.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.420]   If you come in with like a lanyard under like a green yellow and purple lanyard, it doesn't
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.300]   really matter, but it's like covered by your suit.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.040]   And then you also walk in with a glass of wine with wine in it and a cocktail napkin
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.840]   around that glass.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.260]   And you just walk in on the phone.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.620]   They're like, clearly this guy was just inside the high end party.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.440]   It works so well that it was such a cheat code.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.260]   And so that's how, that's how I originally formed a network by like crashing parties.
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260]   And so that was a great way that I met a lot of mentors.
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.560]   And then later in life, I realized like, if I just look at the best men at my wedding,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.020]   almost all of them were from the internet.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.660]   Like people I met on the internet years ago, Noah Kagan, Sam Parr, he's been buddies for decades,
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.920]   right?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.460]   And we met each other through our blogs, through social media.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.780]   And so when you meet, it's, it's like, you got a buddy.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280]   And so I also think like posting on the internet and just participating on the internet, you
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.240]   don't even have to post, even replying and having conversations is probably one of the best
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.300]   ways to meet people now.
