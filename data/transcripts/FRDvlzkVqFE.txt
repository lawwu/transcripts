[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060]   and now you are in new york with the nets how is that for you that moment of getting traded your
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.060]   emotions all over the place i was on a plane headed out to europe for vacation that's when i
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.700]   got the text that's how you found out they couldn't even call me through my agent it was through the
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.780]   team's uh general manager they both texted like yo emergency and i kind of knew at that point
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.920]   what was going down i just didn't know where so the nerve-wracking part was like where am i getting
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.380]   traded to like where am i about to and then i asked them and they said brooklyn and i was like
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.600]   okay that's smooth like i'm excited for that did you ever have a thought in your mind that you were
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.460]   ever going to get traded after you win a championship now the goal you have to win a championship as a
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.700]   team or it's a failure we won the championship and in the next two seasons we came up short
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.640]   and so i kind of had a feeling that they could want to switch some things up and you know i built a home
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.360]   there you know i have friends there but it's the nature of the business i'm like
