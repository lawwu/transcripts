[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   This world is full of pain and heartache that reaches into every one of our lives
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.440]   in some way, not to mention the endless suffering we see on the news. Given all
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.960]   the struggles and the pains of this world, Pastor John recently explained the
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.840]   emotional complexity of being a follower of Christ in this broken world. In a
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.000]   recent sermon, here's what he said. 7.2 million people die of cancer in the
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.040]   world every year, and in America it's been steady for years. About 600,000
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.360]   people die of cancer every year just behind heart disease and sometimes vying
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.560]   for first place. A disease that is unique in its adaptability to evade, evade our
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.720]   efforts to kill it. Another current reality is that I was preparing for
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.640]   1st Peter for the last two days, that I taught for the last two days, and 1st
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.600]   Peter is permeated with suffering more than any other New Testament book. And so
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.800]   I had that on my mind, the suffering of 1st Peter. And then, as you can imagine, I
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   had on my mind the ISIS killing last Monday of the couple dozen Ethiopian
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880]   believers, and before that the Egyptian believers, and after that the 12
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.080]   Christians that were thrown overboard in the Mediterranean Sea, not to mention the
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   900 people from North Africa who were trying to get to Europe who drowned in the
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.080]   last several weeks from the capsizing of their boats. And then I didn't anticipate
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.880]   that there would be an earthquake that would kill at least 2,400 people, and that
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.360]   will probably double over the next several days. And as we speak, people
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.760]   perhaps are lying alive under rubble wondering, "Will anybody reach me?" And so
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:14.000]   that cluster of contemporary realities drew me to speak on this, the world of
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.280]   pain and the purposes of God. In 1995, we entered...I was 15 years into my 33-year
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.480]   pastorate and entered the biggest crisis that we'd ever faced as a church. 230
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.120]   people had walked away. They were angry at me. We had disciplined a staff member.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:49.080]   They didn't like the way it went down. I had opposed a $450,000 pipe organ that I
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.280]   didn't think was God's will for us, and hundreds of people did, and it was
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.800]   the worst time in my ministry and the worst time in the church. And I didn't
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.920]   know...I was 49 years old, and I thought, "I don't know whether there's a future
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.960]   here for me or what will become of this church." One of the things we did was we
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.720]   formed a group of 23 people, about three or four staff members and then
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.280]   laypeople, and we met for a year and a half, and we simply prayed and studied,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.680]   "Who are we? What's happened? Is there a future? What will it be? What will it
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.160]   look like?" During that time, they sent me away to a little monastery over in St.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.960]   Paul, 10 miles away, and said, "Go away, pray, listen to God, and bring us a vision
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.840]   for the church, and we'll interact with it. We know you're not God, and you're not
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.480]   infallible, but you're our leader. Go hear from God as best you can, and
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.680]   then we will refine what he gives you." And one of the things I believe God gave
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.080]   me was a vision for my life. And when I brought it back, it was a one-sentence
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.400]   vision, still is the vision. I asked, "Could this be the vision statement of the
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   church as well?" And it became the vision statement of the church. If you walked
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.080]   into Bethlehem today, downtown, it would be on the wall. If you walked into the
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.300]   North Campus, it would be on the wall. We don't have a South Campus building. We
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.240]   rent that, so they won't let us put things on the wall there. And that
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.880]   sentence goes like this. "I," and now I would say "we," and so does Desiring God, so
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.040]   does Bethlehem College and Seminary, "we exist to spread," very operative word, "to
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:53.160]   spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things, for the joy of all
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:02.320]   peoples," with an "s," "through Jesus Christ." We exist to spread a passion for the
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.000]   supremacy of God in all things, for the joy of all peoples, through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   And when we embraced that, we did not mean we exist to spread a passion for
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   the supremacy of God in all things except earthquakes, supremacy of God in
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.640]   all things except cancer, supremacy of God in all things except babies born with
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.520]   profound disabilities. We didn't mean that. We meant all things, no exceptions.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.080]   We Christians are very complex emotional people if we have our eyes open and our
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.920]   hearts are in tune with the Word of God, because the world is a complex place. The
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:57.480]   world is a beautiful place and a horrible place. So you walk outside right
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   now, it's beautiful, isn't it? It's beautiful. And in Nepal, somebody's groaning under
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.880]   rubble, just about to die of thirst. This is a horrible place and a beautiful
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.520]   place. And inside us, we who love people and are instructed by Jesus Christ how to
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.720]   be, we hear the words, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep."
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.520]   And there is a wedding and a funeral every day at the same time all over the
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.840]   world. And if you're in a church this size, you always know somebody
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   weeping and you always know somebody on tiptoe happiness, which means that 2
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   Corinthians chapter 10 verse 6 is true, sorrowful yet always rejoicing. And you
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:01.000]   don't have to be very old in the Lord to know that's true and possible. When I'm
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.600]   when I got that phone call that every 28 year old dreads, or 15 year old, or 40
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.040]   year old, that mom was killed in a car accident, my mother, and I hung up and
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.680]   said to my wife and my two-year-old who looked up at me and said, "Daddy's sad." And
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.560]   I went back to the room and knelt down, cried for two hours. In that moment,
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:35.320]   longest crying I've ever done in my life, in that hours, those hours, I
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.680]   was saying, "Thank you that I had her for 28 years. Thank you that she was a
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   Christian. Thank you that she didn't suffer long. Thank you that my dad is
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.600]   alive. I don't know if he'll be alive when I get there, but thank you for what
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.440]   a great mom she was. You have been so good to me." I know this is possible. You
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   may not have lived long enough to taste it, but it is possible to be simultaneously
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.920]   profoundly sad and profoundly happy. Simultaneously. Not sequentially.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.160]   Simultaneously. This is possible.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.680]   Incredible. That was from John Piper's recent sermon, "The Pain of the World and
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.640]   the Purposes of God," a sermon he preached in Vancouver on April 26th. You can find
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.960]   the full sermon at desiringgod.org right now, and you can listen to it in its
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.720]   entirety. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
