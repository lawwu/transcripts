[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.920]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.960]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.760]   Now, this episode is a bit different than most, and not just because it's three
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.480]   hours long.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.320]   Why?
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   Well, along my journey to build and grow this podcast, I had a chance to sit down
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.120]   and interview my friend Tim Ferriss about everything he's learned growing his
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.840]   podcast to over 700 million downloads.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.160]   Now, I assume most of you don't have or even want to have a podcast, but I've
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.560]   already gotten so much feedback from non-podcasters that found this episode
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.080]   interesting and valuable to their life and their work.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.840]   And I think that's because we talk about interviewing skills, marketing,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   branding, storytelling, and so much more.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.640]   You'll also get a deep inside look at how podcasts, specifically All The Hacks,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.680]   got started, how everything comes together each week from the equipment, the
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.760]   production, the interviews, and everything else.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.320]   And if that's not interesting, you're welcome to skip this one.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.960]   But you'll definitely want to come back next week for a conversation with the
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   points guy himself, Brian Kelly, all about travel and credit card hacks.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.000]   Also, this episode is the same one released on The Tim Ferriss Show a few
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.360]   weeks ago, so you may have already heard it there.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.840]   And because we originally recorded the intros for Tim's show, it definitely
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.560]   won't start off like a regular episode of All The Hacks.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.040]   All that said, I really hope you enjoy it.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.640]   And as always, you can get in touch at Chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.880]   Let's do this.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.480]   Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.400]   This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.040]   We have had three technical failures, but we've made it happen.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.320]   And this is an improv episode.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.480]   I'm very excited about it because my friend Chris reached out with many
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.280]   questions about podcasting, good questions.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.120]   He had already read much of what I had written.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   He'd listened to several interviews, and this is intended to be an updated
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   guide to all things podcasting.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.760]   The last time I wrote anything at length about this, I think the Tim Ferriss Show
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.520]   had about 60 or 65 million total downloads.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.240]   Now it's past 700 million.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.120]   So the show has grown.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.280]   A lot has happened.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.760]   Technologies have, I want to say, developed, not always evolved, as we may end up
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.840]   covering. But Chris, why don't you take a moment to tell people who you are?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.280]   We've known each other now for at least six years, maybe closer to 10.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.520]   I can't really even recall how we first met, but we have a mutual friend in Kevin
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.600]   Rose and many other people.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.680]   Who are you, Chris?
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   So hi, everybody.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   I'm a bit of one of those crazy lifehacker optimizers, take it to the extreme
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.880]   sometimes. And I host a podcast, hopefully a soon-to-be award-winning podcast
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.160]   called All the Hacks, where I document my journey to upgrade my life, money, travel,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   all while spending less and saving more.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   Outside of that, I'm building new products at Wealthfront.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240]   And before all of this, I've started a few companies, sold a few companies, worked in
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.000]   venture capital, investment banking, management consulting, and kind of traveled
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.120]   around the world for eight months.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.360]   So a bit of a seasoned set of random things, jack of all trades, maybe master of
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.560]   none. And I'm excited to be here.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.000]   Well, I'm excited to jam because I actually haven't spoken at length in detail about
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.280]   the latest and greatest or in some cases, the old and the tried and the true that I
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.400]   don't think needs to change.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.000]   But I want to underscore that you really do know what you're doing when it comes to
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.760]   certain obsessive deep dives that you've done, particularly, I shouldn't say
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:35.040]   particularly, but including travel and points and not just saving or cutting costs,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.240]   but improving the immersive experiences that you have in life.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.120]   And so you've traveled to roughly 70 countries, mostly for free, on points.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.200]   And there's much more to it.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   How many episodes have you recorded and published so far of your podcast?
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.640]   Just so people have some context.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960]   This is relatively new.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.200]   I think I just released episode 19 when we're recording this.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.000]   So it's been I started in May.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.160]   It's September. So only four or five months.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.440]   We'll come at this from many different angles.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.560]   But where do you think it makes sense to start in preparation for this, hoping this
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.920]   would be sort of the one stop shopping or at least the jumping off point for anyone
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.840]   who really wants to study, maybe not best practices, but good practices within
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.480]   podcasting? Where do you think it makes sense to start?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.920]   So there were two things that you've done that I think really gave me a lot of
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.000]   background. And one was the post you mentioned that you wrote in 2016.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.800]   And then you did a maybe two hour or something interview with Rolf Potts on his
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   Deviate podcast and talked a lot about this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.280]   So I thought maybe to kick it off, I'll just highlight some of my takeaways from
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   doing my homework and feel free to say, well, that's wrong.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   That's changed. But we can kind of run through what I learned and then we can kind
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.680]   of run through that same series of kind of getting started, picking gear, finding
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.200]   guests again, and kind of dive deeper on what's changed and how it's evolved and
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.280]   questions that maybe were left unanswered in the original stuff.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.440]   Let's do it.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.000]   Perfect. So when it comes to getting started, this is something that I, like you,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.200]   took a while to decide to start a podcast.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.560]   And one of the pieces of advice that you gave that was really valuable to me was
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.120]   you don't have to commit forever.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   I think it always feels like a thing that you have to do forever.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.320]   Once you start, it happens every week forever.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.160]   And you can kind of set a date and say, let's do five, let's do ten episodes and
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.560]   that's it. And we'll reevaluate.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.080]   So I think that's a really important takeaway is that knowing you don't have to
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.640]   commit forever. And the other big one is it's a lot more work than it seems.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.720]   And so you said only do this if you do it for free, which really means like it's
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.640]   got to be you. It's got to be what format excites you, the tone of voice, the kinds
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.720]   of guests, the questions that are exciting to you.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.360]   Otherwise, you'll get bored.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.920]   And the final kind of getting started advice I took away was, look, if you don't
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   have an audience, don't be afraid.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.800]   Everyone started with some lack of audience at some point.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.640]   And plenty of people with massive audiences have totally failed in podcasting.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   So the quick way is just get a couple episodes out there.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.760]   Keep it simple. Do something you love.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   Don't worry about the business side and experiment.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   And I think that kind of sums up what everyone needs to know in a very concise way
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.400]   before getting started.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.160]   Let me add to that. So I agree with all of that.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.640]   And I want to add a couple of nuances or just
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.720]   additional comments.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.200]   So it's helpful to bracket the minimum and
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.080]   then a check-in point for your
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.480]   commitment to podcasting. In other words, you could say, I'm only committing
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.000]   to do it to X or for Y number of episodes.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.800]   I decided to do six episodes, to commit to six episodes in the beginning because
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   I wanted to ensure that I could win even if I failed.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.080]   What that meant was, what skills can I develop,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.560]   learn or improve?
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.960]   What relationships can I forge or deepen
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   that will be of value to me even if I stop podcasting?
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.600]   So the minimum effective dose for that is probably not one episode.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.960]   It's probably not two episodes, probably not three episodes. For me,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.480]   I thought, "Eh, it's probably somewhere between five and 10.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.160]   Let's just commit to doing six." I don't know exactly why I chose six.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.480]   And the way I could win even if I failed in
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   that case was by improving my ability to ask questions and plan interviews
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.480]   because I was already doing that in the course of writing books.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.120]   When I did research, when I found experts, these were all transferable skills.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.560]   And then I would also have an excuse to deepen relationships with some of my
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.840]   close friends because it's pretty creepy to do hours and hours of internet
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.480]   sleuthing on your friends otherwise. But if you have the pretext of an interview,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   you can actually learn a lot about people like Kevin Rose,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.120]   our mutual friend who was my first guest ever, who shaved my nuts really hard.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.480]   And it's pretty funny to listen to now. It was less amusing at the time.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.520]   So that's, I think, an aspect of the picking of the minimum dose that's important.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.920]   Doing something you love is ideal.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.520]   If you can do something you love, fantastic.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.400]   If you don't know what it is that you love or would love,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.000]   because if it's a new medium, you may have no idea,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.040]   at least do something that is sustainable.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.400]   Don't do something for say six episodes that you can't do for 500 episodes.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   That's my advice. And if you try to out this American life,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   this American life, you're going to get your face ripped off.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.600]   There's a reason when they read the credits at the end that they have staff like
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.840]   20 or 30 people.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.000]   It is an incredible amount of work and they work very hard for it to seem
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.360]   seamless and maybe even improvised. Wow. It's so conversational.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.880]   They do this with the team at Gimlet as well. You listen to like, Oh,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.120]   they're just having a conversation. Like, no, believe me.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.600]   They're not just having a conversation.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.640]   So sustainability is super important. And like you said, Chris,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.520]   there's more involved than you expect. And you should ask yourself,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.120]   this applies to podcasting. It applies to many other things.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.920]   If this costs twice as much, took twice as much time,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   would I still do it? And if the answer is no,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.200]   either don't do it or change the format,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.960]   change the approach so that the answer is yes.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.280]   And podcasting is not the native element for all people.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.360]   So if you think about how people with large audiences have built large
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.760]   audiences, in some cases, they build them on YouTube,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.120]   and then that audience follows them to new formats. In some cases,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.840]   mine would be such a case. They build it through books,
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.700]   but books don't give you direct access to readers in the same way that
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.140]   podcasts do not give you direct access to your listeners.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:14.340]   So I ported the popularity of the books into building a popular
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.020]   blog.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.020]   The blog is what gave me an audience that then traveled in part,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.980]   at least to podcasting. So a lot of building a large audience,
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.140]   if that is one of your goals. And by the way,
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.940]   I don't think that is a worthwhile goal in and of itself. I would ask why, why,
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.580]   why, why at least a few times or so what,
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.980]   at the very least,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.180]   then you need to choose a game you can win.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.780]   And that requires some self-assessment. But for instance,
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.740]   if you decide you should do podcasting because everyone else is doing
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.140]   podcasting, you are going to be outlasted,
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.140]   outsmarted outmaneuvered by people who are really,
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.420]   really enthusiastic about the medium, about the format.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.900]   They're just going to be better and they're going to last longer.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.180]   There's this gigantic kind of elephant graveyard of three episode
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.460]   podcasts. So if you're likely to be a casualty,
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.220]   do something else, pick a different medium.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.500]   And because I mentioned
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.460]   it, I think at the very head of the show, if I didn't, I should have,
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.220]   we had a number of technical difficulties in getting this show started.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.220]   We had a number of false starts. We began,
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.100]   sorry to throw you guys under the bus, but you kind of failed us today.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.300]   Zencaster had a number of issues.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:42.540]   Then the plan was to jump to squad cast, but you have used riverside.fm.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.740]   All of these platforms I have seen fail.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.740]   None of them are perfect. And therefore on the technical side,
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.940]   whether you are in-person or remote,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.220]   the expression that I first learned from friends in the military,
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.060]   two is one and one is none. If you have a single point of failure,
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.020]   you are going to be fucked at some point.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.340]   You will have a disaster and it will be a mess. Always have backup options.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.180]   So in the calendar invite or in the email that was sent to Chris and also in my
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.020]   calendar,
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.260]   there are at least two backup options and both of us are currently recording
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.700]   local backup audio using QuickTime audio.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.300]   So those are a few things that I wanted to add.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.140]   Please continue, Chris.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.620]   So I do want to talk about gear, but I'll ask one question before,
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.580]   which is in 2017, you said, yeah,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.180]   it's definitely not too late to start a podcast, but you know,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.820]   that was a long time ago. 24% of people had listened to a podcast.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.140]   Now it's closer to 60. There were a few hundred thousand podcasts.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.420]   Now there's over 2 million.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.580]   You still think we're early in the days of podcasting and there's lots of
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.740]   opportunity or is it too crowded and people should consider new mediums for
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.500]   content?
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.020]   I think it's still super early. I think it's still super, super early.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.740]   There are some indicators or maybe
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.540]   proxies that you can use for that.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.460]   The percentage of say terrestrial radio or satellite radio advertising
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.460]   dollars that have migrated to podcasting is still extremely low.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.860]   I don't know what the percentage is, but it's very low.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.660]   I would anticipate just based on the types of brands that you see represented
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.460]   and you can look at other types of media. So based on that alone,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:32.260]   I think we are very much in the early days, super,
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.380]   super early days.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.980]   And that said,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.500]   we've seen a lot of changes over the last handful of years.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.700]   If you look at the charts, say on Apple or elsewhere,
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.220]   if you look at Apple,
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.740]   the one person shops or small team shops
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.380]   like mine are fewer and fewer and far between
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.140]   where let's just say when I got started in whenever it was
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.940]   2014, I think maybe a little bit earlier,
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:11.260]   you had Joe Rogan way up at the top. Of course you had Nerdist,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.220]   you had Mark Maron,
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.980]   you had a handful of others who were constantly in the
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.740]   top 10 top 20 on what was then iTunes.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.500]   What you see now is professional outfits.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.380]   You see companies, you see organizations, WNYC,
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.100]   you see Pushkin, which I think does a really nice job.
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.220]   You see actual companies.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.180]   You see also incumbents previous sort of terrestrial incumbents who are
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.300]   now investing dollars into podcasting.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.940]   So there has never been more competition,
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.980]   but the analogy I might use is let's use
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.100]   startup investing, something that you and I are quite familiar with.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.740]   So I had the very good luck of starting to
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.100]   do angel investing in 2008.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.940]   Now this was perfect timing because there was a financial crisis,
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.460]   which meant all the fair weather entrepreneurs,
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.540]   founders, and investors kind of ran for the hills.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.740]   And that left the diehards on the true believers,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:28.380]   which meant that the playing field was very uncrowded and
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.460]   you could actually find really, really good startups.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.580]   I believed all over the place in 2008, 2009,
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.500]   it was a great time to invest in 2000, say 15 or so.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.700]   I decided to exit stage left,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.180]   not because there weren't great companies, there were great companies,
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.180]   but it was a lot harder. The deal terms were harder.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.700]   There was a huge influx of capital from all over the place,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.780]   including China. Things were getting really weird for me. And I realized, okay,
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.580]   this just went from single deck blackjack where you can have a system as a solo
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.700]   player, as a team to multiple deck blackjack.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.860]   And I don't have confidence using my own bankroll that I can win in this
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.220]   environment. So I took a long break. Similarly,
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.860]   you just have to be better now when I started in 2014.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.220]   And if you had an existing audience that would travel with you,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.140]   you could be in the top 20, 30, 40,
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:31.140]   50 on then iTunes, now Apple with relative ease.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.660]   And you can still do that.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.380]   If you have a massive influx of subscribers over a short period of time,
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.620]   it could be a few days, could be a week, but you'll fall off.
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.180]   It's simply harder now.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:46.660]   So there's all the more reason why you should have confidence that you're going
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:52.300]   to do this with some degree of dedication to the craft.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.460]   Like you, Chris,
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.860]   you're taking the study of the craft and the practice and the deliberate training,
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.820]   so to speak very seriously. And you have to have, I think,
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.140]   good reasons for doing it. And a good reason could be, I enjoy doing it. Great.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.060]   That's a good enough reason.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.820]   You do not need to be on the charts to have a quote unquote successful podcast,
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.340]   but you have to ask yourself, why am I starting a podcast?
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.580]   Why do I want to start a podcast? So let me ask you that, Chris,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.860]   why did you want to start a podcast? Why did you decide to start a podcast?
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.140]   I think two things happened at the same time.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.780]   So one was I found myself constantly,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.340]   whether I was with a group of people I knew or didn't know,
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   kind of telling a story about a level of optimization that in the financial
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.260]   travel world that most people hadn't thought about. And I thought, man,
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.420]   I love telling that story to people.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.300]   Could I tell that story at more scale?
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.500]   Cause it seems like it's happening to a person at a time.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.700]   That was a piece of it. And then the bigger piece was I loved that game.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.100]   And I knew that the only way I would get better at that game and go deeper at
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.540]   that game was to learn.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.460]   And there are people out there that know much more about different types of ways
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.060]   to upgrade life, ways to optimize,
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.300]   ways to make more money or save more money or invest better. You know,
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.460]   I was going to find those people and have those conversations anyway,
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.300]   cause I was,
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.020]   but I knew that people loved hearing those stories in small groups.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.620]   And I thought if I had a platform where I could have those conversations and
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.460]   share them,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.780]   people just like I would see at a dinner table would enjoy listening to them on
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.580]   a run at home, driving in the car. And so I thought,
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.260]   I'm going to do this anyways. I love doing it.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.220]   Why not see if other people really do want to listen at scale? And they did.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.980]   Do you still feel like that is enough?
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.580]   The psychic gratification of sharing what you would have done otherwise,
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.580]   because the reality is it is kind of what you would have done otherwise,
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.460]   but the setup and the tech and the microphones and the post-production and
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.140]   everything else involved adds a layer of labor and
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.900]   complexity. So what on top of that, if anything,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.580]   there doesn't need to be anything extra,
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.580]   but how has your thinking changed on what makes it worthwhile to continue or
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.420]   not?
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.260]   Well, what's interesting is let's take an episode I did with a writer,
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.420]   Morgan Housel, and it was all about the psychology of money.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.740]   I'd read the book. I'd been fascinated by it.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.620]   I had questions I wanted to ask Morgan.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.300]   I could probably just reach out and say, Hey,
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.220]   I'm just a person and I want to learn more about what you wrote. Can we talk?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.740]   But I'm guessing I would have had better success, which I did saying, Hey,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.140]   I have this podcast. I want to talk.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.620]   I want to ask you those questions and share that with my audience.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.340]   And so having the podcast lets you level up.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.740]   I believe the people you can have those conversations with,
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.820]   because there's a reason it gives a reason to do that.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.060]   And then as the audience grows, it gives a second reason.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.300]   So one is you could just reach out and say, can we do a phone call, but you know,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.540]   there's at least a reason. And then as the audience grows, there's more.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.780]   And that I think is worth the trade-off of the amount of work you have to put
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:06.020]   into it. But, you know, you mentioned gear, there's a world where,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.820]   and I believe you can buy a microphone for under a hundred dollars and
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.020]   use a pair of headphones you already own and keep it pretty simple.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.700]   And I think to your, your original post and what we talked about earlier,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.060]   the more simple you make it,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.140]   the easier it will be to keep going and the more authentic it will
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.900]   be, which, you know,
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.740]   you may think you want to say something because it's what the audience wants to
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.660]   hear. And there's this weird thing where it's actually just ask what you want.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.540]   And most people are more engaged by your engagement with a conversation than if
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.740]   you ask a question they want to hear, but you're bored having that conversation.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.860]   Yeah, absolutely. And, and just to give people a sense right now,
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.140]   I'm using what I use more or less all of the time
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.220]   for remote recording and I remotely record even pre COVID
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.180]   probably 80, 90% of my interviews.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:04.180]   It allows you to get better guests by the way, generally speaking,
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.180]   unless you're the undisputed King of podcasts, like Joe Rogan,
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.220]   then you can insist on in-person visits,
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.300]   but very few podcasters have that leverage and you will sacrifice some guests
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.700]   by having those conditions. So I do everything remotely.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.980]   It makes my life easier as well. I'm in a farmhouse right now.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.820]   I've recorded dozens of podcasts here and I have a Logitech
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.900]   Brio camera, which I do not use all of the time.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.980]   I very frequently do audio only.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.860]   We could talk about why I don't do more video.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.860]   I have an audio technica ATR 2100 X,
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.020]   one of the more recent, it might be a 2,500, but,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.660]   and you have that exact microphone in front of you.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.140]   This is probably, what would you say? An $80, 80 to a hundred dollar microphone
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.300]   that connects to my MacBook pro.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.060]   And then I'm using AirPods for in-ear
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.900]   listening. That's it.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.460]   That is the sum total of hardware that I am using.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.860]   And we're currently recording on riverside.fm, which you use.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.220]   I typically use Zencastr and Squadcast,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.700]   but all of these things break. So have backup.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.140]   And if this didn't work,
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.700]   I also have a conference line with no
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.500]   pin that can be set to record.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.380]   So if my computer broke,
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.540]   I could call Chris on my cell phone and we could record the
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.380]   conversation.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.220]   I have backups upon backups upon backups and trust me at some point,
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.060]   you're going to need it.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.660]   Is there a point at which you would just reschedule instead of,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.620]   or how do you think about that? You know,
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.580]   the quality of a conference bridge being maybe not worth doing now
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.180]   and postponing to when your computer worked again.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.380]   I will reschedule if the connection is
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.220]   really bad or if the audio on the opposite end is very
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.060]   poor.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:10.100]   And to try to minimize the likelihood of the audio
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.060]   being poor on the other end,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.500]   we ship every guest a microphone,
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.700]   unless they already have a really polished setup.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.860]   We will use Amazon prime to buy an audio technica,
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.900]   2100 mic and ship it to them.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.940]   And it's very easy to do it's 80 to a hundred bucks.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.700]   And that may not make any sense in the beginning or be feasible in the
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.100]   beginning.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.260]   But right now for the type of operation that I run and very quickly,
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:46.700]   the cost of rescheduling is more to me than 80 to a hundred dollars.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.500]   However, you can have a great mic and a really terrible room.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.260]   So if someone's in a room with lots of metal, lots of glass,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:59.460]   you could have a very bouncy room, even with a decent mic.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.380]   So there are other technical tricks that are not really tricks,
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.860]   but you could have a mediocre mic in a room with lots of carpet and drapes,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   and you're going to probably have better sound than a really nice mic in some
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.140]   highly modern metallic glass bouncy room.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.380]   If you end up in that type of environment,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.780]   there are tricks you can use like putting pillows in the corners of the room.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.340]   That's what I learned from Edward Norton.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.900]   Actually he was in a really bouncy room and he said, hold on,
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.260]   I know how to fix this. And he fixed it. I was like, wow, that's genius.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.820]   So you do get better at these things over time,
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.940]   but I very rarely reschedule unless one of us is sick or
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.140]   the sound quality is absolutely abysmal.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.660]   But a bridge line recording is not going to
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.300]   give you Carnegie hall symphony quality fidelity,
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.020]   but nobody really cares is what I've realized. I don't use equalizers.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.980]   I don't use any of these external devices that one might
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.060]   think are necessary. Yes, they can improve quality sometimes,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.420]   but as Morgan Spurlock said to me on this podcast,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.540]   once you get fancy, fancy gets broken.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.220]   And I prefer to have the fewest number of moving pieces possible.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.420]   When I record in person, just to cover that,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.780]   I use the zoom H six recording device with XLR
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   cables and generally SM 58 stage microphones,
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.340]   which are sure microphones. There are the oldest microphones you can imagine.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.820]   Yes. So you have the H six,
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:42.060]   you could take the SM 58 mic and probably throw it against a brick
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.980]   wall and it would be fine. That's my guess.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.500]   And I can throw all of that gear into a backpack.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.740]   I can travel with my entire podcast studio. So to speak,
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.340]   it's been good enough for between 600 and 700 episodes.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.860]   And I don't have any plans to change. So that is the gear.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.140]   I use a similar setup. And I would say, I don't know if you,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.780]   you know, a specific one, you could go listen to the episodes I've done.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.420]   And one of them, someone had no headphones, no microphone.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.780]   We were just using a Mac book.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.860]   And I'd be shocked if someone could actually that isn't an audio engineer could
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.380]   go back and pick out which one it is.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.020]   Pro tip that we ended up using earlier in this conversation,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.380]   which I picked up from Kevin Rose,
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.540]   actually who has a lot of experience with this kind of thing is if you're doing
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.380]   a remote recording and you ask someone to check their source to
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.820]   make sure the inputs and outputs are set properly,
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.580]   they might say my mic is selected, but if it sounds funny to you,
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.460]   ask them to tap the mic. If they tap the mic and you don't hear that,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:48.420]   right. That, that kind of punchy tapping sound,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.660]   then it means it is not selected.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.260]   It's probably their headset or the built-in microphone on the
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.020]   laptop.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.180]   So that's an easy way to test to see if the proper external mic
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.780]   is selected. All right, Chris, what else should we cover?
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.420]   So I think we covered gear a lot. One thing you mentioned was video early on.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.420]   Your advice to people was don't use video. It makes it easier for guests.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.940]   You can look at your notes. You said that's evolved a little bit.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.020]   We're recording video today. How do you think about that differently now?
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.220]   Or do you think about it differently in a way that wouldn't apply to someone
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.060]   else?
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.860]   I record video now if someone wants to record.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.740]   And if I think it will improve the rapport in some fashion,
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:40.140]   I still frequently record without video because I
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.660]   like to have lots of notes. I do quite a bit of homework.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.180]   My team does quite a bit of homework for each guest.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.820]   And I like to have my notes in front of me.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.820]   And it sometimes can be very distracting if you're having a conversation with
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.660]   someone on video and you're looking off screen like Rain Man.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.260]   I also like the ability to set,
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.260]   and I always set both the laptop and my iPhone to do not disturb because
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.100]   you might just receive a FaceTime audio call and that could mess up your
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.100]   interview. It does happen. I've seen it. I've experienced it. It's not fun.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.100]   So do not disturb, do not disturb.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.500]   But with do not disturb on my iPhone,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.100]   if I'm not using video,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.780]   you could also take yourself off video temporarily to do this,
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.540]   or you could tell the guest in advance that if you check your iPhone,
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.900]   you're not checking email, you're Googling something.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.620]   What will sometimes happen is a guest will say, Oh, well,
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.540]   there's a book by so-and-so it's called this. I can't remember the author name.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.020]   You can look that up.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.060]   Or they will say there are three people who are really good at X,
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.940]   Y, and Z. They'll name two. And then they'll say the second person.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.140]   I think their first name is Laura or Brian,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.980]   and you can look it up so you don't have to deal with it in post-production or
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.860]   put it in the show notes.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.900]   You can look it up on an iPhone and no one who is listening will hear you tap
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.780]   the iPhone, but they will very often hear you tap a laptop.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.980]   So I use my phone in that way.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.300]   Now you could have a production assistant or a producer or an engineer or
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   someone like that, who would do this for you, which is what Joe Rogan does.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.860]   But I don't do that. I have a, I have a smaller team, by the way,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.740]   it works spectacularly well. Now, speaking of Joe,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.660]   so Joe Rogan is fluent in video.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.580]   He is absolutely adept and expert and
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.060]   comfortable being in front of the cameras and making really good use of
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.580]   cameras. I think one of the reasons, not the only reason,
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.260]   but one of the major reasons that Joe has become as big as he has
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.900]   is his use of YouTube.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.580]   I don't know if it's still the second largest search engine in the world,
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.060]   but it is a, an enormous traffic driver,
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.380]   particularly if you take not just your long form videos and put them
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.060]   online, but create clips as he has through Jerry clips and so on.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.180]   And if you are bringing on guests who are going to be
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.420]   capitalizing on news or who are part of the news themselves,
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.500]   then people will be searching for these temporarily
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.300]   relevant topics, whether it's someone who got fired,
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.220]   someone who got in trouble, someone who made a big decision,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.780]   a CEO who just found themselves in the news. If you do that,
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.900]   you can drive a lot of traffic.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.220]   I want to produce for the most part
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.500]   evergreen episodes that will have very fat tails.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.380]   They get listened to for years and years and years and don't lose their
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.220]   relevance.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.420]   That's important to me and I don't want to
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.620]   immerse myself in the news any more than absolutely necessary.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.500]   So I don't do that.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.140]   I also don't think that I am as good on video as Joe.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.420]   He has a studio. He has a visually interesting environment. He is funny.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.460]   He's a comedian. He's an entertainer, very smart entertainer,
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.740]   but he's a very, very, very skilled entertainer. And it makes sense.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:12.180]   And they have just more production capacity.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.540]   They've invested more in making that a core component of what they do.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.820]   I just am not interested enough.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.340]   Could I make my show bigger? Would it be bigger if I tried to do all of that?
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.420]   I think it would be,
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:31.340]   but this is an example of knowing where you are strong,
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.260]   knowing where you are perhaps not as strong and also asking yourself,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.740]   why am I doing this? Does my show,
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.820]   does the Tim Ferriss show need to be two times bigger, three times bigger,
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.660]   10 times bigger?
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.260]   I can't come up with a really compelling reason for why that's the case.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.660]   Would I like it to grow? Yes.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.220]   Do I need it to grow? Even if it involves doing things I dislike? No,
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.820]   that would be so stupid. It would be so stupid. And I've made that mistake.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.340]   You're at a scale now that your show can afford the, you know,
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.780]   person to help you prep for guests and that kind of stuff.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.740]   What do you think about people earlier?
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.260]   I'm at a place right now where I've recorded the video of a lot of my
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.300]   interviews, but I haven't done anything with it yet.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.180]   And I know it could help grow the show and the show couldn't monetize to support
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.540]   it. So growth is kind of a factor.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.340]   It plays into the longevity of the show because it takes time.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.180]   And yes, I would do it for free, but you got bills, you got, you know,
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.940]   people have things they have to do. So if they want to do it more,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.940]   it does need to grow.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.820]   Do you think it would be different if your show was smaller and it couldn't
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.380]   afford all of those things?
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.420]   Yeah. Well, let me, let me dig into a bunch of pieces of what you just
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.460]   said and ask some follow-up questions.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.060]   So how different would my operation look if I were just getting
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.820]   started? Well, let's rewind the clock.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   I can tell you exactly what I did when I got started.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.500]   I wanted to know how to do everything and that's part of my nature,
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.100]   but it's also because I wanted to try to create as elegant an
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.940]   operation as possible for myself.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.580]   Elegant is not, does not have the same definition.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.620]   It doesn't have the same puzzle pieces for everyone.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.380]   So I not only recorded everything myself, I edited everything myself.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.660]   I published everything myself.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.540]   I uploaded the file to hosting services and so
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.820]   on and so forth. So in the very early days,
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.540]   I didn't have someone to help me with research.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.580]   I still appreciate and value having someone to help me with
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.620]   research. But if for whatever reason that weren't possible,
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.740]   I have full confidence that I could do that myself.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.300]   But let's, let's take a look at something you said, and that is,
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.660]   and it comes back to this question I had earlier of,
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:56.260]   is the podcast still worth it? Right. To get to episode 50, episode 100 for you,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:01.380]   what does the podcast need to be for it to be
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.300]   worth doing? Well worth doing, easily worth doing, right? And so you said,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:10.500]   we got bills, shit, got bills to pay, got to keep this ship afloat.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.540]   Now I don't have a perfect window into all of your personal finances,
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.180]   but I have on some reasonable authority,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.300]   sufficient belief that you could probably cover your podcasting bills.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.980]   And I know the costs involved with a lot of podcasting without having to monetize
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.340]   the show. So it would be nice to monetize the show,
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.300]   but you could make that money in some other way.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.140]   So let me jump to a point about monetizing that I mentioned,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.780]   I believe in that 2016 article, and probably again,
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.980]   with Rolf Potts on Deviate. And that is in the beginning,
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:52.060]   I did not focus on monetization. Now it's very easy for someone to say, well,
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.500]   you already had money. Therefore, your advice doesn't apply to me.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.940]   Your experience doesn't apply to me.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:02.460]   I would discourage you from looking at it with that lens, you meaning listener,
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.220]   because you can learn something from everyone.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.980]   And even if their decisions are not the decisions you would make,
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:14.060]   it's helpful to learn how more experienced people have thought about it.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.980]   So the way they go about making decisions,
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.380]   I felt, especially since I was doing the editing and so on myself,
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.460]   that any focus on monetization,
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.020]   even if you think it's only going to be 5% of your time,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:34.060]   and we can come back to sort of preoccupation versus active time
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:34.900]   on something.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:40.620]   I didn't want anything to distract from my focus on improving my
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.380]   ability to prepare an interview and edit.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.300]   I wanted to focus on the craft, the product, and that was it.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.260]   That was to be my, my real soul focus, which the editing helps with,
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.900]   by the way, the editing forces you to listen to everything really carefully,
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.300]   not saying everyone should edit their own stuff.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.860]   I no longer edit my own episodes,
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   but we do get everything transcribed and we go through and we look at ways to
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.900]   clean up and tighten and possibly cut or rearrange.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.140]   We do that with a lot of episodes, not all of them.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:16.260]   So I didn't focus on or pay attention to monetizing for the first,
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.900]   I don't know, I'd have to go back and somebody could probably confirm this,
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.420]   but who knows 60, 70, a hundred episodes. I'm not even sure.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.060]   By that point,
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.820]   the downloads were such that I had a
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.340]   broader spectrum of possible sponsors to choose from.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.580]   And that felt better to me than taking whatever came over the transom
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.140]   early. However, I believe Chris,
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.860]   one of your questions that you had for me was along the lines of,
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.140]   should I say no to things that come over the transom?
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.820]   So let me take a step back and I will answer that,
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.460]   but how are you thinking about monetizing? Because it is very easy.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.700]   And I'm not saying this to you, Chris, specifically,
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.820]   but for people to get pulled away
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.780]   from the creative by the siren song,
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.060]   the mesmerizing nature of monetizing,
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   because every time you go on Twitter, there's something trending. That's like,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:16.260]   here's how much top influencers get paid on Instagram. And you're like, what?
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.700]   A hundred thousand dollars a post. That's crazy.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.340]   I want to make a hundred thousand dollars a post. And then, oh boy,
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.940]   then you're lost. So how are you thinking about monetizing right now?
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.900]   And I should say, Chris is smart. You're smart with your money.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.540]   You are very deliberate and you've done a lot of homework.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.700]   You're a student of personal finance and money,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.300]   but how are you thinking about monetizing and what to do or not do with it?
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:43.180]   Yeah. So I think I took a similar approach to you and it was maybe for a
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.020]   slightly, if your reason was to hone the craft,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.780]   mine was to prove out the longevity.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:53.380]   So going to spend any time monetizing your podcast before you
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.740]   realize this is something that I could do for a long time,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.340]   which you will never know until you do it for at least you did six.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.300]   For me, it probably took five or 10, maybe 10 episodes. Until that point,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.540]   it would have been a complete waste of time to think about monetizing because I
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.980]   didn't know if I was going to do this.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.220]   And the amount of money you're going to make on a 10 episode podcast is almost
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.300]   nothing. So I said,
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.180]   let's make sure this is something I could do forever before I think about it.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.660]   Then I thought, okay,
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.500]   let's also make sure that the amount of money it would generate is even worth
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.300]   the effort. Sponsors have reached out and said, oh,
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.700]   we want to advertise on two episodes. It's like, okay, but like,
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.260]   if I'm going to sell, you know, two sponsors on a show, two episodes at a time,
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.700]   we're talking 50 calls a year to sponsors.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.020]   And that's just the ones that say, yes. So maybe you're, you're doing,
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.700]   you know, 200 calls to try to line sponsors up.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.220]   That just seemed like a distraction for how much it would make.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.580]   So I had a similar kind of thought,
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.300]   which is get to a point in time where the amount of money you'd make for the
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.020]   amount of work it would take to bring that money in is worth it.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.580]   And the only deviation from that was when people called outreach and say, hey,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.060]   can we just do this? And it's like, well, now it's no longer work.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.620]   But even then I've since decided to say no,
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.740]   not because I think it would ruin the show,
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.300]   but just because I have a list of things that I prioritize. And for me,
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.100]   it's making the content great and finding the people to bring on.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.580]   If I spend time on anything else,
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.820]   it takes away from that and that is not yet on autopilot.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.100]   And I think ultimately that's all that really matters.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.220]   Like your show's not going to be good if it's not something people enjoy
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:33.860]   listening to,
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.020]   which is usually a factor of who's talking and how much those people have thought
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.300]   about what they're going to say or,
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.820]   or at least prepared to have a good conversation.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.540]   Yeah. I think that makes a whole lot of sense.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.860]   A couple of thoughts also on monetizing,
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:54.020]   figure out what would be amazing from a
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.060]   monetizing perspective.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:00.980]   And I'm very deliberately not saying sponsorship or advertising perspective
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.860]   because there are many different ways to convert a podcast
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.500]   into shouldn't say convert as a side effect of doing an
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.620]   awesome podcast to produce income.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.980]   Let's just say you are a high priced consultant and you
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.140]   don't have any advertising,
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.980]   but you generate clients from the podcast.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.380]   That would be a somewhat straightforward example.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.940]   You could have as many people do, especially in the early days,
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.740]   affiliate relationships,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.540]   very often the most lucrative of which are going to be with certain types of
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.460]   products, right? Domain services, hosting, et cetera.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.420]   They have a very high stickiness with their
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.500]   customers, high level of stickiness, low churn rate,
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.820]   which means high lifetime value.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:56.180]   They're willing to pay you quite a bit upfront, but is that what you want?
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.140]   Are those the products, services, et cetera,
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.580]   that you want to be endorsing? Maybe, maybe not.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:08.860]   There are many different ways to approach this many different ways to
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.260]   generate income.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.060]   Perhaps you have a newsletter that is a paid newsletter and
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.820]   people sign up for that.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.940]   Perhaps you have a different version of the podcast,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.060]   or you have a membership of some sort outside of newsletters.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.420]   Maybe people pay for the show notes.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.660]   I mean, these are all real examples that I've seen for myself.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.220]   I decided that sponsorship was the easiest.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:38.940]   I've done some experiments with membership and they all just entailed more
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.100]   headache for me.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.380]   And I felt ultimately less value all around than
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:49.260]   sponsorships, assuming in my case that I am using or
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.220]   testing everything personally,
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:56.300]   that is where the sponsorships are somewhat time
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.900]   consuming for me. But I don't,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.100]   I don't mind it because I actually use like, if you walked around my house,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.580]   you would recognize all sorts of stuff from my sponsors.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.340]   And I don't just have them because they're sponsors.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.660]   Like I have them because they are good products or services.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.500]   And let me give a couple of examples of
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:21.220]   questioning best practices or standard operating procedure
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.740]   with sponsors.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.540]   And this may help people to simplify their approach.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.460]   So I did not ask myself,
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:35.740]   how can I make as much money with sponsors through the podcast?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.420]   Because there are no constraints on that.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:43.300]   You're not applying constraints in such a way to ensure that your
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.980]   life does not become a miserable existence of just being a
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.420]   pinata for every ask and request of dozens of
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.820]   sponsors, right? As it might be in the example that you gave,
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.460]   that could be a huge pain in the ass.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.980]   So what constraints could you apply to ensure that it does not become a
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.580]   monster you have to feed or a huge distraction?
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.780]   A very simple constraint that I applied was a,
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.140]   we're going to have our own insertion order document that is going to be
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:18.180]   non-negotiable and everyone is going to prepay for their spots.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.060]   We will not have any terms. We're not going to have accounts receivable.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.980]   We're not going to chase people for payment.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.820]   Everybody is going to pay up front.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.620]   And what do you think the response was from sponsors?
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.460]   Initially, the response was, what the fuck are you talking about?
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.060]   We get terms from everyone. That's how this is done. And I said, that's fine.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.980]   We don't have to work together.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.380]   This is just what allows me and my tiny team to remain sane.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:49.180]   So if it's not worth it, it's not worth it. I totally understand.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:54.140]   Let me get back to work and make the podcast so good that there
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.780]   will be at least a few sponsors who are going to say, you know what, fuck it.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.020]   We will pay you up front.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.340]   And that is something we have stuck to.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:08.100]   And I cannot tell you how much that has simplified our lives and our
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.980]   operations. It also acts as a litmus test for
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:17.020]   commitment from sponsors, because as you noted,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.180]   to fill, let's just say in your case, right,
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.380]   50 different sponsors at two spots a piece.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.140]   If you have a high churn rate,
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.580]   meaning a lot of those people take two episodes and then split and never come
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.700]   back, you're just going to have to do that again next year. That's exhausting.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:38.380]   Right? So I want to make sure there's a high level of commitment,
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.060]   but there's also a high level of vetting on my side,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:48.460]   therefore a high probability that the product
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.500]   and the company will do really,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.140]   really well in the podcast because I don't want them to do two or three spots.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.460]   And we do insist on a test of multiple spots.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.580]   Not sure if it's two right now, it might be three.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.900]   And my podcast is expensive, very, very, very expensive. I mean,
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.100]   it's a premium podcast.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:09.380]   I want them to spend millions of dollars on the podcast over a long period of
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.220]   time.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.460]   So everything is geared towards that because it's,
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.660]   it just simplifies everything for everyone.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.500]   But the point I wanted to make is question best practices.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.700]   And if you are not in a position to question best practices,
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.860]   your product isn't good enough,
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.940]   or you just don't have enough leverage for some reason.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.060]   And you should take a very close look at those reasons,
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.660]   but it doesn't hurt to ask for instance,
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.020]   what does every almost 99% of authors out there do?
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:43.180]   They publish a book in hardcover six to nine months later,
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.220]   the book comes out in paperback and they hit the press junket once again.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.740]   And they go on tour to announce the launch of paperback.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.740]   None of my books have ever gone to paperback. Why is that Tim Ferriss?
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.660]   I'll tell you it's because, and the numbers vary,
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.860]   but not by that much.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:07.500]   Let's say that you're getting a 12% royalty on your hardcover book.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:13.860]   Paperback royalties is probably going to be 6%, six and a half percent.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.340]   So broadly speaking,
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:21.500]   paperback royalties are you will get paid 50% of what you're currently earning
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.380]   per book by going to paperback. What does that mean?
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.420]   That means you have to sell twice as many books to make the same amount of
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.460]   money. I'm skipping over some specifics here,
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.420]   but more or less you have to sell twice as many books to make what you are
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:44.660]   making right now. What is the benefit to the reader of this? Well,
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.660]   we live in a world with audio with Kindle
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.500]   and the benefit to the customer.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:57.260]   We also have libraries where you can get e-format for free oftentimes.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.460]   And actually I learned of a very cool,
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.700]   I think it was a Chrome extension on your podcast. In fact, about this,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:08.060]   the benefit to the consumer used to be they could save whatever it might be,
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:12.300]   $5 on cover price with Amazon,
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.500]   which is generally selling it almost, I mean,
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.100]   often close to wholesale prices, that benefit just no longer exists.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.300]   So for a marginal to non-existent benefit to the end reader,
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.020]   you are going to voluntarily cut your royalties in half,
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:31.500]   which means you have to sell twice as many books to earn the same amount per
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.540]   year. That made no sense to me. So I've never done it.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.180]   And to their credit, my publishers early on,
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:45.340]   we're open to this logic for staying in hardcover.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.420]   And it worked out really, really well.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.900]   I did not have a lot of leverage in the beginning, right?
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.780]   I did not have sort of Tim Ferriss and Mara Key Lights as people,
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.340]   or some people perceive it today. I simply laid out the logic, right?
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.620]   So really question what you have to do,
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.980]   because sometimes those best practices make no sense whatsoever.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.420]   It seems like with every business,
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:11.660]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.820]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:20.100]   manual processes, and there's no one source of truth. If this is you,
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:25.020]   you should know these three numbers, 37,025, 1.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.420]   37,000.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.940]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.300]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.420]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting,
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.380]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more. 25.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.540]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.340]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.100]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.700]   And one because your business is one of a kind.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.260]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.220]   system with one source of truth, manage risk,

[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:39.420]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.860]   good for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.860]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.740]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.820]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.500]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.260]   theraflavins and catechins.
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.900]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides,
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.420]   heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.900]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.980]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.860]   travel friendly. They have so many products,
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.900]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.700]   energy and the black Pu-Erh,
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:30.340]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.620]   is so good and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.140]   And if you need another reason,
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:39.020]   search for all the amazing research backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut,
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.460]   microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:45.740]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.740]   teas in the world.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.700]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.100]   free US shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.700]   And for a limited time,
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:00.580]   you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples at
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.980]   my link at allthehacks.com/peak. That's P-I-Q-U-E.

[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.980]   We've talked about getting ready and all of that, but I'm curious.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.700]   I think the bulk of what goes into podcasting is finding guests,
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.380]   prepping for the conversation and having the conversation.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.700]   And I'll tell everyone, even if you don't have a podcast,
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.260]   thinking about how to find interesting people and to have a better,
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.580]   more informative, exciting conversation is probably valuable just in life.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.180]   I mean,
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.460]   you said the reason you got started and if you never continued,
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.780]   you will have at least learned the skill that was really valuable.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.620]   So I'll start with finding people.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.180]   When you first wrote your original post,
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.620]   there wasn't that much about finding people, you know,
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.100]   look for people you're interested in.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.060]   The one thing that you said,
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.220]   maybe not in that post that I thought was really interesting was don't put as
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.980]   much value as you think on how big of a name they are.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:07.180]   That maybe half of your top episodes are people that your listeners had never
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.020]   heard of before.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:13.060]   And so it just keeps coming back to content is really,
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:13.900]   really important.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:18.260]   And people like good content more than they like bad content with a fancy name.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.740]   I can attest to some of the episodes where I thought people had the smallest
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.380]   names that no one had ever heard of have far outperformed conversations I've had
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.740]   with like Ramit Sethi, who, you know, we had a great conversation and,
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.060]   and lots of people know his name.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:35.620]   And that is something that I don't think I thought going in would ever be true.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.900]   Yes.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:41.020]   Why yes, let's jump in.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:45.900]   So this comes back to the initial question of why do
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.540]   you want to do a podcast and maybe it should be framed differently.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.300]   What is so compelling about this that you're going to want to do a
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.500]   hundred episodes of this podcast? Maybe that's the question.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.020]   What is so compelling about this,
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:04.700]   that you will be so thrilled about doing a hundred episodes of this podcast
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.820]   that you would pay, not get paid, but you would pay to do this podcast?
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:15.020]   Chances are the answer is not banging your head against a
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.860]   wall,
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:20.900]   trying to get through a phalanx of publicists and lawyers and managers
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.180]   and getting the runaround from like Hollywood entourage for a
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:30.020]   year to get a guest. Chances are, you wouldn't pay to do that.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:36.180]   If you chase famous people, you are going to do that just to be clear.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:41.060]   So maybe you should focus on doing something that
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.900]   really satisfies you. And maybe in some niche,
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.460]   God knows where some way, somehow it's so fucking good
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.380]   that like a hundred people who might know famous people are like, wow,
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.060]   this is really smart. That's not guaranteed, but it's a possibility.
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.100]   So for me,
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.980]   the answer is follow your interests
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:09.460]   and make it easy in the beginning. So in the first,
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.620]   I want to say five to 10, maybe 20 or 30 episodes,
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:18.780]   I only interviewed people I knew quite well because I
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.580]   didn't need the nerves of interviewing a stranger
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:28.620]   to add to what was already somewhat challenging. Does that make sense?
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.660]   And I remember, I think it was Ed Catmull,
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.260]   the former president of Pixar,
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:39.100]   who was the first person I'd ever interviewed who I
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.420]   hadn't had a conversation with prior to the actual interview.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.260]   And it was nerve wracking ended up being a really fun
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.180]   interview, but it was very stressful for me. Why?
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:55.900]   I couldn't really pinpoint because I talked to strangers all the time.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:01.180]   And that's certainly true with the books, but it felt different.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.300]   So make it as easy as possible in the beginning,
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.020]   stack the deck so that you can win in the beginning.
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.180]   And for me, that meant doing it with friends.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.860]   In terms of finding guests,
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:18.860]   there are as many ways as you could imagine,
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.700]   and probably more than you could imagine,
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.820]   but the focus of the show will direct how you search.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.660]   So in my case, the Tim Ferriss show
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:36.220]   has always been about world-class performers in different
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.220]   disciplines and trying to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books,
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:40.860]   et cetera,
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:45.380]   that make them tick or that they think might contribute to making them good at
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.540]   what they do. Frameworks, decisions,
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.700]   thought process, all of that. Turns out that's very, very broad.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.180]   So I have some people on the docket, like there's a,
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.060]   I think it's a violin assessor,
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.380]   like evaluator,
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:05.900]   someone who assesses and rehabilitates, you know,
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.820]   multi-million dollar violins.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:13.700]   I can tell you with great confidence that that does not have a large
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:14.940]   built-in audience,
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:19.820]   but it's interesting to me.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.220]   And I also think about which guests
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.940]   will care enough to bring their A game.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.380]   It doesn't matter how famous your guest is.
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.380]   It doesn't matter how good your guest is. If they don't bring their A game,
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.460]   Chris, one of the things you asked me,
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.620]   if I'd be willing to do is listen to a few episodes,
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.060]   your podcast and provide feedback.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:47.100]   And the first episode I listened to is actually the first episode you published,
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:52.300]   which I learned later was the fifth that you'd recorded, which is smart on pro
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.740]   travel hacks with, is it Lee Rowan? Is that how you say the last name? Yeah.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.340]   Rowan and, and Lee
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.780]   is amazing. Lee is like Sam Harris.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.860]   If he didn't have a teleprompter or something that man speaks and finished
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.980]   prose, it's ridiculous. Right?
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.620]   So Lee is one of those guests who clearly brought his
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.460]   A game.
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.340]   And I thought you did a very good job in the interview.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.660]   And it's an area where you have a lot of domain expertise,
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:25.580]   but honestly you could have been making like zoo animal noises and he could have
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.460]   just run. And it would have been an incredible interview slash monologue.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.020]   Do you know what I mean? If you were just like,
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:37.900]   I'm going to give you words that I pull out of this hat and
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:43.380]   I want you to riff for five minutes. And you're like, uh, arthropod, uh,
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:47.540]   tax optimization, uh, grizzly bears.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.220]   Like I'm sure it would have been a really fascinating conversation because Lee
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.980]   is just that good. You know what I mean? There are those guests.
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:58.500]   Esther Perel is one who comes to mind immediately. Hugh Jackman was,
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.860]   was like that for me. There are many guests,
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.540]   including those you wouldn't recognize who are going to be
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.140]   really, really, really good.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.500]   So a big part of guest selection is also
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.180]   improving as an interviewer in quotation marks.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:21.660]   Ultimately it is very hard to fix a bad guest.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.300]   It does not matter how good you are as an interviewer.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.380]   The only fix that I have found is if I generally budget 90 to 120
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.580]   minutes for an interview, I'll usually say 90.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:36.300]   If I get 30 minutes in and I'm like, Oh my God, this is a stillborn.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:40.620]   Like this is a mess. This is, we're not getting anywhere, which by the way,
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.980]   it can happen with people who are very, very, very good conversationalists.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.460]   But as soon as you hit record,
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.420]   once it's an interview and not a conversation over wine at dinner,
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:53.300]   they get really stilted and weird and can't be themselves.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.660]   That happens quite often. Then I will talk more.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.340]   This doesn't work for everyone. It won't work for everyone,
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.460]   but generally I'm going to come into the interview.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.060]   Having done a lot of homework, I'll have some domain familiarity,
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   if not expertise.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:13.180]   And I will then ask a question where I can reciprocate and give examples or
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.620]   buy time by talking about something else.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:21.100]   And in doing so I will extend the time we might record for two to two and a
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   half hours.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:27.380]   And then we can cut that down to say
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.740]   30 to 60 minutes. It will probably include a lot of me.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.100]   And the downside to that is people will be like, wow,
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.060]   this guy really likes to hear himself talk. And it's like, no,
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.780]   I just saved this interview.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.700]   And at the end of the day,
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:44.260]   there will be some actionable takeaways within that interview, right?
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.540]   So that's one way to save it.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.620]   I will only try to save an interview like that if someone is at least trying and
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.820]   they have done the prep work.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.540]   So when I talk to people or I should say prior to ever
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.380]   interviewing,
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:02.140]   people will have a list of commonly asked rapid fire
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.740]   questions, which I have right here.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.820]   People will recognize a lot of them from Tribe of Mentors and other
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.980]   places. But there are certain questions I ask a lot like the metaphorical
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.020]   billboard question, favorite failures, et cetera, right?
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.780]   There's certain questions I ask frequently.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.980]   I send this to people in advance.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.380]   I generally don't send other questions in advance.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:28.660]   And I always talk to people beforehand for five to 10 minutes
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.820]   before recording to loosen them up.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:36.300]   This is assuming they're not somebody who's got a publicist cracking the whip on
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.140]   my face.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:40.980]   So assuming they have a little bit of slack in the system,
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.580]   we'll talk in the beginning. I will first say you,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.940]   like all of my guests have final cut. You can see a transcript beforehand.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.020]   You can listen to the audio, any edits you want to make. We can make,
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.780]   this is not a show about gotchas. So number one, there's that.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.700]   And I will say, I've been screwed by journalists before I've been,
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.300]   had my trust betrayed. I have had things cherry picked. I've been misquoted.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.420]   It sucks. I'm not going to do that. And you have final cut,
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.740]   which by the way, is what inside the actors studio always did.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.340]   And what you might've seen on TV for those episodes,
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.500]   45 minutes an hour was actually several hours of recording.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.540]   They would cut down substantially. So I'll do that first.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.020]   And in the say warmup calisthenics,
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:29.340]   I will always ask someone what would make this interview a home run.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.700]   When you look back three, six months from now,
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.580]   what would make this an absolute home run where when people ask you,
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.460]   what are your favorite two or three interviews,
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.980]   this is one of those two or three.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:46.020]   And people are always almost always surprised when I asked
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.580]   that because it's, it's never asked.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.100]   And then I'll tell them because that can inform how I try to steer the
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.260]   conversation. It will also inform how we promote the episode.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.180]   So let me know if you have an answer. And if not, if you have an answer later,
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:05.420]   we can try to customize things. I will also ask them,
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.300]   is there anything you absolutely don't want to talk about
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:13.060]   or something that you're really sick of talking about that you just don't want
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.540]   to rehash? I will ask that.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.620]   And by the time you ask these questions or these types of questions,
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.220]   a someone has warmed up a little bit B,
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.540]   they will think to themselves, okay, wow,
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:32.460]   this guy's really put some thought into this is aware that I'm coming into this
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:37.060]   with certain goals and hopes or fears.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   And this is not his first rodeo.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.580]   And what I'll also then tell people is we can always cut things later,
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.620]   but we can't put interesting things in.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.180]   So feel free to curse, be yourself,
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.620]   like let it all hang out. We can always cut things later,
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.340]   but we can't put it in. We can't put the fun in.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:04.300]   Go crazy. And we can always cut, I would say out of
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.340]   whatever it is now, six to 700 episodes,
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.860]   less than 3% of the guests ever ask to see the audio or
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.900]   transcript. It's very uncommon,
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.980]   but I will take notes as we talk.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.780]   And if someone say mentioned something like a lawsuit,
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.500]   which might be legally complicated for them,
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.740]   it weren't broadcast to millions of people or just made public to honestly
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.860]   an audience of a hundred people,
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:40.500]   or if they mentioned say details about their family or where they live,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.980]   or they say, let me give out my email address.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:48.220]   I will flag all of those things. And I will talk to them afterwards and say,
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.540]   do you want to keep this in? Are you sure you want to keep this in?
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.980]   I would suggest you cut this dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, to look out for them also.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:01.540]   And then my team will also listen to things and review transcripts to try to
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.980]   identify other things that should be cut.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:07.340]   Twitter is an excellent way to source guests to come back to that question.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.900]   You asked so long ago, Twitter's an excellent way to find guests.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.780]   Although part of my feedback to you on your podcast is
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.500]   you mentioned Twitter a lot. And Twitter is a very,
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.140]   even though it's expanded a lot and I'm sure it rankles Twitter to death,
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.300]   Donald Trump kind of saved Twitter.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:31.340]   How funny is that? It's still a very tech centric environment.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.700]   And so I would suggest to you that you drive
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.740]   people to the website and preferably some type of newsletter
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:46.380]   so that you have the ability to communicate directly with your
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.020]   listeners. Podcasting is still largely a black box.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:55.260]   It's very difficult to get good analytics.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.940]   This is also why it's very difficult for me to give growth advice because it's
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.420]   very difficult to confirm attribution for different
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.980]   types of organic or paid acquisition or PR is
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.780]   incredibly difficult. We can talk about growth. I'm happy to talk about it,
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:16.660]   but the reason Twitter works specifically for guest
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.340]   recruitment is probably similar to how you could use other
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.060]   platforms, but my other platforms are completely deluged. For instance,
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.420]   maybe you could use Instagram DMS for this,
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:33.460]   but because I'm flooded by DMS and anyone apparently can send me a
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.260]   DM on Instagram, I can't use it. There's too much noise, not enough signal.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.180]   So it's an unusable tool for me.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.300]   But on Twitter, if you follow someone and then you like something of theirs,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.460]   and then you retweet, and it's a lot easier if you have a verified account,
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:52.820]   of course, to get someone's attention. But if you follow them, like something,
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.780]   retweet something, maybe reply to something of theirs and kind of do it all at
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.060]   once so that you occupy more of their timeline,
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.780]   if they're looking at replies and things like this, if they follow you,
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.500]   you can DM them. And if you DM them and connect with them,
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.620]   you can do so without having any of their contact information.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.740]   You don't have their email address. You don't have their phone number.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.980]   If they dislike you, they can block you. In other words,
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:27.340]   they don't have the same fear factor associated with you having a direct
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.940]   line to them in any fashion. So for Tribe of Mentors, as an example, the book,
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.820]   there were a hundred,
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:38.820]   maybe 120 people who answered many of the common questions for the podcast.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:45.180]   And the way I connected with Ben Stiller and dozens of the larger celebrities,
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.660]   better known figures was through Twitter.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.340]   That is how I made contact with them.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.860]   It is also a very good way to make contact with well-known people,
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.780]   or even if they're not well-known,
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:03.820]   difficult to reach people and to circumvent around their multiple layers of
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:10.180]   entourage. Because if you email an agent or a manager,
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.860]   just get ready for the merry-go-round of bullshit to start.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.220]   And there are some great agents and managers out there.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.140]   I don't want to imply that there aren't,
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.900]   but if you're dealing with anything related to Hollywood, nine times out of 10,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.940]   you are just going to get this incredible runaround dance that can last
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.380]   forever.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.660]   There are some incredibly talented and hardworking and great agents and managers.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:39.620]   So again, not to malign all of those people in those categories,
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:45.260]   but you run the risk of an incredible amount of hurry up and wait that can last
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.980]   years. Even at this point for me, by the way, that is true.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.220]   Do you think if you had their email, you would use it over Twitter or is it,
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.740]   you think Twitter is a better medium? It might be better.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:04.500]   It may be less crowded. It depends entirely on how many people they follow.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.180]   So it depends a lot.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:12.500]   I will say that as someone who gets an incredible amount of bullshit,
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:17.860]   bullshit sent to me through one means or another,
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:23.540]   that if I have channels that are intended for people to get in touch with me and
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:28.260]   they disregard those channels and think they're clever by barraging me somehow,
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.980]   they're immediately blacklisted.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.940]   And most people, if they do get a random email from you,
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.740]   what I would suggest,
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:39.540]   if you're going to take that approach that you indicate in the email,
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.940]   how you got their email address,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.900]   no one on my team will ever reply to someone who cold emails or if they try to
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.860]   get a hold on like phones or anything like that, immediate blacklist.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:53.380]   But maybe via email, if they reach out,
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.100]   if they don't indicate how they found the email, no response.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.260]   Like they need to clarify that first.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.540]   But if they have channels for getting in touch with them,
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.020]   I would suggest that first, unless they're the, their agency.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:11.500]   It's not that you can't and should never reach out to an agent or a PR or a
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.500]   PR agency or a manager to try to reach,
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:24.220]   say a celebrity or someone who's well-known it's that you should expect that to
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.780]   take a lot of time.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:31.980]   And an alternative or a compliment to that would be Twitter with all of the time.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:40.620]   And this is true actually for a lot of optimizing in general for me,
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.260]   even though I am fascinated by sort of,
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.380]   we can talk about what kind of what optimize means, right.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.340]   Optimize for what is a good question when thinking about a lot of these things.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.340]   But if I think about the number of pod casters or would be podcasters who ask me
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:01.420]   about guest recruitment and they don't need my help to get 90% of the people out
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:07.140]   there. So really the question is,
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.940]   how do I get guests who are hard to reach?
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.460]   That's the question.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:16.980]   If they completely avoided guests who are hard to reach and just focused on
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:22.140]   fucking recording another 10 episodes in the same amount of time,
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:26.100]   the same number of hours that they're going to blow trying to get Oprah on their
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:30.100]   podcast. God bless Oprah. I wish I could have her on my podcast.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:30.980]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:35.220]   I think they would be much further ahead at the end of the day.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:40.100]   I'll say two things about that first episode I did with Lee. One,
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300]   Lee had never been on another podcast.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.460]   So Lee is not a celebrity name that I think anyone knows.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.820]   And that podcast,
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:52.220]   that first episode has had two and a half times more downloads than every other
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.580]   episode. Yeah. So it's content way over the name.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.700]   And the other thing,
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.820]   just because I thought it was a funny example of technology failing.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.500]   So in that episode, we actually recorded in person.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.300]   We used a zoom and we had a bad SD card,
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.300]   no backup.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.540]   And so that episode was actually three days
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.900]   later, re-recording the episodes. It was a little different than the original,
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.780]   but I will say going into that,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.900]   I had this huge fear that you'll never be able to recreate a good episode if you
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.460]   have to. And I'm not saying I would ever encourage it,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.580]   but that fear was kind of busted.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.980]   So I would rather have had the backup of the original because it's hard to try
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:37.660]   to keep it going. But if you have to, it's not always a bad outcome.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.180]   Not always a bad outcome.
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.780]   So I should actually modify my gear recommendation and say that I also have
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.740]   redundancy in person. So I have the H6. I've got that.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:52.140]   Usually I'll have another H6 sitting out and
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.540]   recording, but without the XLR.
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.780]   So it'll be sort of a field recording set up.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:04.700]   I may also have an iPhone with a
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:10.580]   lightning port connected Shure microphone.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.340]   They make some really, really cool, smaller microphones.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.980]   I can't remember the exact model number,
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:21.620]   but I will have redundancy in person as well
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:25.460]   as backup options remotely. Now I want to come back to one thing.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.500]   And for those people who want to find this episode,
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.580]   we'll link to it in the show notes,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.620]   obviously for the pro travel hacks episode,
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.900]   number one of all the hacks.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.580]   I have another piece of feedback there for you.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.340]   Lee Rowan is L E I G H last name R O W
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.380]   A N. So two things I want to say,
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.700]   the first piece of feedback is that I would definitely transcribe all of your
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.020]   episodes and read them yourself in the beginning,
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.580]   especially and look for terms that you repeat a lot and try to
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.260]   trim those down. So for instance,
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:05.980]   as essential as the term is to the namesake of the
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.780]   podcast, all the hacks,
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:13.340]   I would suggest perhaps dialing down on the volume of using the word
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.220]   hack or hacks and thinking about it like a magazine article.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.700]   If that word came up over and over again, the editor would be like,
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.100]   here's thesaurus.com. Please come up with some other words.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:28.620]   So on the audio side, I think it's very similar.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.060]   And we all have these texts. We all have texts.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.580]   And I remember actually after the Ed Catmull episode, Oh, this is terrible.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.660]   I looked on social to see what type of feedback there might be.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.780]   And I saw many tweets with
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.220]   MMM dot, dot, dot, MMM, dot, dot, dot, MMM, dot, dot, dot.
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.460]   You're driving me fucking crazy. And it turned out,
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:57.900]   I was so nervous that every time he said something interesting about, Hmm, Hmm,
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.900]   like some cave creature.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:05.860]   And it was just cringe worthy to listen to.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.660]   I had no awareness that I was doing it. And there are other words,
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.140]   pet phrases, et cetera, that in any given interview,
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.620]   I might repeat way too many times. So keep an eye out for that.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.060]   The other way that I used transcripts early on.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.540]   And one of your questions for me has been,
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.380]   how have you honed your interviewing skills? Do you ask friends,
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.380]   mentors to listen to episodes and give feedback?
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.460]   Do you read, listen to your own episodes?
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.740]   Let me answer those specifically and then I'll come back to how I use the
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:38.060]   transcript. Do I read, listen to my own episodes? No, I don't.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:43.140]   I read the transcripts because it is more
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.100]   painfully obvious what you need to change.
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:50.940]   You can get away with things in conversation that work and can work really
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.540]   well.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:56.580]   There is no one good style of interviewing or one great style
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.180]   of conversation. There are many,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.740]   many ways to do this and many ways to play this game.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.020]   So I don't think it makes any sense for everyone to emulate one particular
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.540]   interviewer or style of interviewing. However,
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:12.380]   reading the transcript will make you
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:17.820]   acutely aware of any repetition, verbal tics,
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:22.220]   things like that. So I do not listen to them unless I'm checking audio quality,
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.380]   which I used to do, of course,
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.980]   but these days I have a team to help with that. And by team, I need,
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:32.700]   I mean a contracted post-production sound engineer.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.420]   I do not have,
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.660]   I have two full-time employees for everything that I do in my life,
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.060]   just to give people an idea of how small my team is.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:46.020]   Do I ask friends or mentors to listen? Sometimes I do,
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.260]   but in the beginning, if I did that,
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:54.380]   and this is true with asking friends for feedback on
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:59.300]   writing as well, I don't think it's very high yield,
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.420]   very helpful.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.340]   And certainly I think it's quite frustrating for the friends you're asking for
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.020]   advice. If you just say, give me feedback,
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.420]   I don't think that's specific enough.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.140]   So in the case of writing what I would do and still do,
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.460]   if I'm writing a book, I split up chapters,
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.100]   which are intended to mostly be self-sufficient for kind of modular in that way.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.940]   They're like feature magazine articles, the chapters,
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:27.540]   and I will send say a single chapter to three or
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.140]   four friends. Ideally they are writers or lawyers,
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.740]   or they've gone to law school. This is for writing,
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.380]   although it can apply to audio as well.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:45.540]   The reason for that is that both writers and people who have reviewed documents
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:50.140]   or learned to use a legal eye for reviewing
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.220]   text have a keen eye for ambiguity.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.980]   They have a keen eye for anything superfluous that you just do not need that
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.660]   should be cut or can be cut. They have very,
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.820]   very sharp observation with respect to that.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.260]   So they make good proofreaders in my experience.
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:10.100]   And I will say among other things, please read this.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:15.700]   And if anything is confusing, please note that
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.220]   you can love it. You can hate it. I'm fine with either of those,
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.020]   but if it's confusing, it's no good for anyone. So if anything's confusing,
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.740]   please note, if your mind starts to wander,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.980]   please note where that is. If your mind starts to wander means it's dragging.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.060]   So I listened to a few of your episodes.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.940]   There were a few points where I was going on a hike.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.980]   Like there were points when I was totally immersed in the audio.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.260]   And then there were points where I'm like a squirrel, trees, a bird,
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:46.060]   a butterfly, which is fine because I'm on a hike.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:50.860]   But your intention I assume is to captivate me with the audio.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.900]   And there are points where my mind started to wander.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:56.740]   So you can ask someone to indicate like if your mind starts to wander,
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.260]   indicate the time code,
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.180]   make sure you use the same application for the time code,
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.260]   because it can vary from application to application.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.140]   So if you're using Overcast, use Overcast. If it's Pocket Cast, use Pocket Cast.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.660]   If it's Spotify, use Spotify, but have everyone use the same app. Okay.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:18.740]   In addition to that, I will say, if you could only keep 20%,
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:22.740]   if I were going to cut 80% of this interview, which 20% should I keep?
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.420]   And would you cut it? Hold on one second. I'll get to that. Then conversely,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:31.860]   and you don't have to use both of these, but I would say if I had to cut 20%,
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.740]   which 20% would I cut? I actually liked that question more,
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.180]   but I do ask both for different reasons. Because if I give it to four people,
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.100]   if one person loves a section and three other people say, cut it, I will keep it.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.260]   If anyone loves something, I keep it. That's my rule.
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:52.780]   But very often I wouldn't ask for feedback if I weren't
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:57.180]   planning on somehow using the feedback, if I found it valuable. So the answer is,
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.020]   yes, I very often make these cuts,
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:04.660]   but asking your friends to listen to audio and do this
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:06.020]   is really time consuming.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.500]   And it's actually very hard for them to specify things.
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.580]   So what did I do with my transcripts?
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.580]   One thing I did is I ended up reaching out and finding someone who did research
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:22.580]   and guest prep and everything for inside the actor's studio.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:28.220]   And I asked them if they would be willing to read transcripts of some of my
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.940]   early episodes and to indicate where they thought I could improve,
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.020]   what they think I should cut,
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:36.900]   where they think the sequence might be off in terms of questions.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.700]   And that's what we did.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.700]   I would send them word docs and they would add comments and red line and so on.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.700]   You could certainly use Google docs or something else.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.420]   I now use Google docs for this type of thing,
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:52.540]   but that is how I improved my interviewing and
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:58.900]   interviewing just as a, as an aside, but it's not really an aside.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.460]   This is sort of a core piece of the discussion is like anything else, right?
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.100]   It's like basketball, like what makes a good basketball player? Well,
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:10.420]   which position are they playing? What is the other team, right?
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.340]   If they're boxers, like styles make fights, right? It's like, okay,
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.860]   just because A beats B and B beats C doesn't mean A is going to beat C.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:23.340]   It really depends on styles. And if you look at salespeople,
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:25.580]   what makes a good salesperson? Well, what are they selling?
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.060]   Some people are so charismatic and have this reality distortion field that
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.300]   people want to befriend them and they'll buy from them as a result of that.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.660]   Some people are super,
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.460]   super technical and kind of dispassionate in a way.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:41.980]   And others are really good at deal structure and figuring out conditional
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.260]   purchase orders and kind of navigating
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.140]   the wants and needs of the other person and being very,
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:55.300]   very creative in how to structure a purchase, maybe finance a purchase, right?
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:59.020]   These are all different characteristics and different skillsets,
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:04.060]   yet all of them could be exceptionally good salespeople.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.460]   The same thing is true in podcasting. You know,
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.740]   if you want to grow your podcasts,
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.180]   like turn yourself into a super hot woman and talk about blowjobs.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:18.820]   I've seen a few podcasts that have done really well by, uh,
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.540]   doing that in addition to many other things that you have to get right.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:25.820]   That is sort of, it's not necessary, but, uh, not sufficient.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.220]   I wouldn't say it's necessary, but you can't do that. Chris,
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.340]   you could, I don't know. Maybe you'd find a market for it,
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.340]   but that's not going to work for you.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.460]   If I tried to be Joe Rogan with his knack and
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.860]   talent and developed skill for comedy, it would fall flat.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.780]   I'm not going to try to be Joe Rogan.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:48.980]   James Lipton when he ran inside the actor's studio,
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.900]   never deviated from his questions. He had his list of questions.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.980]   They were stacked in order on these blue cards and he would never
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.700]   deviate.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:03.340]   Even if there was a side door to a topic that could be more
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.900]   interesting, he would not take that side door.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.780]   Now some people might judge that harshly and say, well, that's stupid.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.740]   You should have taken the side door. Well, does anyone know your podcast?
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.660]   A lot of people know inside the actor's studio seems to have worked pretty well.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.060]   Maybe that format was exactly what he needed.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:24.900]   Then you have folks who come in with meticulous notes.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:29.700]   I come in with lots and lots and lots and lots of notes that works for
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.580]   me. Larry King came in blind.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.940]   Larry King, who also one could say was early to the radio game in the same way
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.580]   that some people are early to the podcast game.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:43.100]   So you have to take that into consideration and maybe discount things a little
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:47.420]   bit, but he would come in with beginner's eyes to ask the
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:52.060]   naive questions that a listener might want to ask.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.420]   He didn't want to know more than the listener or the viewer.
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.820]   So this is all to say,
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.740]   becoming a better interviewer is really becoming your best
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.500]   self as an interviewer.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.260]   But no matter what, reviewing transcripts for me is a core piece of that and
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.260]   collecting questions.
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:16.060]   I remember I would effectively have not a three ring binder, but a collection
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.420]   of questions. I would take photographs of my phone pre COVID.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.860]   Certainly if you're taking flights, it'd be the only time that I read magazines
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:27.180]   and you look at these inflight magazines, there are always interviews.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.740]   And if I found a good question, I would take a photograph and I would test it.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.780]   If I listened to a podcast and I heard a good question,
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.020]   I would note it.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:42.500]   I've been interviewing people for hiring for a new position recently.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.820]   And someone I was interviewing, I solicited questions and they said,
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.420]   how do you give feedback?
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   Could you give me a few examples of when people have disappointed you and how
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.820]   you've handled that? And I thought to myself, holy shit, that's a good question.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.980]   I might steal that one.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.660]   So be a collector and a tester of questions also.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.660]   So I have a bunch, I'm like going back to my man.
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.980]   I have a bunch of followups here.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.140]   Yeah, let's do it.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:14.500]   Backing up to the prep, how long are you spending?
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.460]   Let's go back to if you were doing this all on your own, preparing for,
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.380]   for an interview.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.460]   It depends on the interview,
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:25.060]   but I would say generally minimum a few hours.
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:29.620]   So let's just call it minimum two to four hours.
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:34.860]   And I have some approaches for that that I can share and
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.780]   maximum, for instance,
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.940]   if there is a possible big break interview.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.340]   And one of those for me was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.980]   When that finally came together,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:50.980]   I spent probably four or five days digesting everything about Arnold
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:55.500]   Schwarzenegger in watching interviews, watching movies, reading books,
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.820]   going through every past interview I could find.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.540]   I wanted to be the best prepared interviewer
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:08.700]   he had ever met basically. And therefore I took it very, very seriously.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.180]   But if we're talking about on the
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:18.020]   average side, let's just assume that's three to four hours.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:22.220]   Now I spend less time because I have help and I have
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:28.580]   cultivated a system and also improved the system with the input of team
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.380]   members, how to prepare research documents.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.940]   I would say two to four hours.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:39.860]   I will also ask guests to send their favorite
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.940]   two to three long form interviews.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:46.940]   I will ask them and not all guests are keen to do this,
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:50.980]   but some are very keen for exploratory
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:56.340]   topics or questions that they think could be fun for
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.420]   us and the audience and anything else that they would like to send.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:05.500]   So I opened that door and all of those things are received typically weeks
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:10.460]   or months in advance because the editorial calendar is built out quite far in
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.060]   advance. At least these days it is.
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.820]   If you're doing prep from scratch,
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:20.100]   if the person has a Wikipedia page,
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.540]   I look for the strangest or most esoteric slash tiny
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:28.500]   unusual mention in Wikipedia. And I do a deep dive on that point.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   And I go into the citations.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.660]   I will certainly look at social.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.620]   This is important because for instance,
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.820]   in between the time that you book a guest and you record,
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:44.420]   they could have a family member die.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.660]   They could have any number of things happen.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.580]   They could have some type of disaster in the press.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.100]   You want to be aware of what is going on.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.020]   So I don't spend a lot of time on social,
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.860]   but I will check in and go back at least a month or
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.780]   two to ensure that I have a basic understanding of what is on their minds and
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.620]   hearts. That doesn't take very long.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:09.100]   I would say that's less than less than 30 minutes.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:12.780]   So you have Wikipedia and then long form interviews.
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.540]   So I will look at print.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:18.620]   I will start print meaning text, long form,
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:23.060]   text interviews. I will look at the interviews that they've sent.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:27.180]   And that helps me in a number of different ways.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.540]   It shows me where they're good.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:33.860]   It shows me where they stall out or don't have answers.
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:38.060]   It also helps me to gather what I consider
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.660]   greatest hits stories.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:44.140]   And here's what I mean by that.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:48.620]   We all have stories that we have told more than once,
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:54.420]   just like comedians who have worked on their material and refined over and over
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:56.620]   again, that's 60 minutes special.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:01.780]   We all have stories that over time we have determined
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.980]   get a great response.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.900]   And I want to know what those are.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.180]   And sometimes I'll ask them point blank,
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:16.700]   either in prep or while we're doing the warmup in the beginning, I'll say, Hey,
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:20.460]   is there a story that I can cue? I don't want to hear the story now,
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:25.140]   but a story that's really funny or that always gets a response from audiences.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:27.020]   Maybe you've done a lot of speaking engagements.
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.740]   It's something that people always come up to you and mention.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:34.740]   Is there any story or anecdote or metaphor could be anything
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.900]   terrible that comes to mind. And oftentimes they'll say,
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.100]   let me think about that. Yeah, there is. Okay. Ask me about the time that X,
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:46.260]   ask me about when I was in college and why happened. Great.
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:51.540]   I will plant one of those greatest hits stories within the first 10 minutes.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:57.100]   If I have one of those to pull people in and
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.860]   hopefully pass the driveway test,
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:04.060]   as I heard someone from NPR put it, which is,
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.860]   and this happens with podcasts too,
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.340]   when you're listening to it in the car and you've got 10 or 20 minutes left and
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.540]   you get home and you just have to finish it.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.620]   So you stay in the car in the driveway and you listen to the end.
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.260]   I think it's helpful to plan that through.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.420]   So those are a few of the ways that I do research.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:25.140]   If we have any common friends
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:27.820]   or acquaintances,
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:32.660]   I will also ask them for topics and questions they think
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:37.300]   might be fun or that might take us on the road,
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:41.420]   less traveled. And I used to do this more than I do now,
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:46.260]   but I will sometimes post it to social and ask what types of questions
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.420]   people would love me to ask given the size of my audience on social.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:54.900]   Now that makes less and less sense because it's very hard to filter very hard to
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.220]   gather them. I will sometimes do that, but not, not terribly often.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:03.460]   Have you ever done so much research that you kind of
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:07.500]   knew the entire conversation you would have in advance because you'd learned,
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.900]   you know, you'd read someone's book, you learned all this information.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:13.780]   It's like coming in Arnold Schwarzenegger so prepared, you know,
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.980]   there were probably things that you wanted to talk about that you knew the
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:17.980]   answers to,
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.540]   but how did that go because now it's not as engaging because you know the
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:26.660]   answers. Yeah. I will always leave lots of
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:31.100]   virgin territory. So I will have some familiarity,
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:34.340]   not with all guests, but some with greatest hit stories.
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:37.460]   So I'll plant a few of those, but generally speaking,
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.780]   my interviews are going to be at least 90 minutes.
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.260]   That will be maximum five to 20 minutes of the
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:49.140]   conversation. There may also be things that they've talked about,
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:53.020]   but there's some aspect that was left out. And I'll ask about that.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:57.580]   So my rule or one of the fundamental
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:03.180]   precepts of how I approach podcasting is if it's
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.900]   interesting to you, it will be interesting to other people.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.100]   You can't fucking fake it. People can smell it out.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:14.980]   It's like dogs can smell fear audiences know when you are stoked and
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.740]   audiences know when you're faking it.
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:20.060]   So you got to make the interviews interesting for yourself.
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:25.540]   Even if it gets into some really strange topics that are going to appeal to a
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.060]   very small percentage of your audience, doesn't matter.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:32.380]   You got to include it and you can always cut it out later,
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.340]   but you got to make it interesting for yourself. So in the case of Schwarzenegger,
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.180]   yes,
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:42.660]   I had consumed vast quantities of interviews
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:47.660]   and footage and commentary and so on related to
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:51.060]   Arnold, but he has decades of
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:56.500]   time on this planet and there is a lot that is not covered.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:01.380]   So it was easy for me to weave in questions that would take
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.100]   us to unexplored areas. That was very, very easy.
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.180]   I'll also say,
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.460]   do not get too attached to your research
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:17.140]   in the sense that 90 minutes goes very, very quickly. I mean,
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:19.180]   we've been recording for more than 90 minutes now,
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.740]   90 minutes goes very quickly.
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:25.420]   So if you have tons of research in front of you,
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:31.580]   pick the five to seven questions you most want to get
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.980]   answered. That is for 90 minutes.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:39.380]   Keep in mind because I want the freedom and the slack to
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.700]   explore side doors.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:45.860]   And we may end up scrapping all the research that I've done and save it for a
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:47.580]   round two, which is something I do quite a lot.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.820]   And then I'll circle the things that we didn't get to with a highlighter and put
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.260]   R2 on them, take photographs, put it into Evernote.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.620]   And I share that with my team. And I'm like,
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.940]   this is what we'll use for a round two.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:35:00.020]   Don't be attached to finishing all of your questions.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:05.060]   And very often what I will do to try to limit the impulse
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:09.220]   to do that is I will block an interview into
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.900]   sections. I don't do this always,
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:14.500]   but sometimes to let a guest know what is coming,
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:18.380]   I will say for the first 30 minutes, we're going to bounce all over the place.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:22.500]   It's going to be background, personal story, et cetera.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.700]   And I always ask them for specifics and
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:31.260]   examples, high concept, abstract stuff, bores the shit out of audiences.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.220]   It bores the shit out of me. There can be some high concept stuff,
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:38.260]   but we need real examples, real details. And so on.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.300]   If someone's not willing to do that, by the way,
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:44.460]   I will sometimes not publish the audio. So if they don't bring their a game,
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.340]   if they're not playing to win and really doing the prep,
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.740]   I don't feel obligated to publish that happens very rarely,
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:54.420]   but I'd say around a dozen interviews I haven't published.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.140]   Like if they're not actually trying,
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.060]   if they're not attempting to do what will appeal to the audience,
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.460]   I'm not going to publish.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:07.380]   Are you direct with them and you're telling them why you didn't publish?
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:11.580]   Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes you just lose, lose the audio.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.540]   Oh yeah, exactly. I mean,
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:16.660]   I wish I could tell you that I'm always a hundred percent honest about that,
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.620]   but sometimes, especially in the early days,
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:23.300]   I was not confident or comfortable enough to do that.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.900]   So there was a lot of audio that just vanished into the cloud,
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.020]   hard to explain, but it happens.
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:31.740]   And it's sometimes out there would be a make good on that.
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.780]   So let's say they have an excellent book,
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:38.060]   but the interview was just terrible.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:43.300]   Then I might offer to take an excerpt from the book from a particularly
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.140]   good chapter,
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:48.660]   put it on the blog and then use that as a way to assist in some fashion.
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:52.700]   One of the questions that you had and don't lose track of your follow-up
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.500]   questions, but one of the questions you had is, do I read the books these days?
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:59.180]   No. And in fact, I get sent and have been sent.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:03.780]   There was a point where I was getting sent 50 plus books a week from
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.380]   publishers, by the way, never signed up for these lists, never asked for them.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.300]   So if any publishers are listening, please take me off your list.
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.980]   Cause I I'm going to start putting specific names on the sort of public hall of
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:20.940]   shame for spamming me with physical books.
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:25.660]   You're killing trees you're causing the decline of our
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:30.060]   earth unnecessarily with books that I'm just going to give away. Stop it.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.100]   Stop it. Stop doing it. Take me off your list.
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:38.380]   But the point is I was getting 50 plus books a week and that's just untenable.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:42.820]   I can't even the books from friends or acquaintances.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.620]   If you consider the hundreds of people I've had on the podcast and the many
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.660]   people that I know, and I've met over the years,
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:52.340]   it's physically impossible for me to read these books and I don't want to have to
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.300]   pick and choose. So I actually put up,
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:58.140]   people can see it at Tim dot blog slash new books.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:01.500]   It is the one decision that removes a thousand decisions.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.900]   There's a blog post about that.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:07.060]   And one of the policies is I will not read the books beforehand.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.020]   I'm only reading old books,
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.220]   meaning books that have not been published in this year. So I don't do that.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.060]   However,
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:18.700]   you can ask the publicist or the author to
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:23.580]   send you some high level concepts or a one or
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.020]   two pager, if they're using that for interviews and so on,
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:30.300]   you can have them do that. But I do not read books in advance.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.900]   There have been cases where I've read the book in preparation,
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.700]   like in Arnold Schwarzenegger's case,
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:41.700]   or if the authors are authors I've followed for a long time,
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.540]   like Walter Isaacson, for instance,
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:47.740]   who's written incredible biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Da Vinci and so
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.060]   on, then I will read the books, but it's quite rare,
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:55.500]   especially in the last two years. But in the beginning, yes, look,
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.740]   you got to earn
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:02.660]   the quality of the output in your interviews.
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.340]   And if reading is going to help then do it because in the beginning,
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.460]   you're not going to be getting sent 50 books a week.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.740]   You may have slack in the system to do that.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.700]   What other questions or topics?
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:17.980]   In the beginning, did you ever, as I've even found myself,
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.060]   as your interview skills get better and better, it's easier and easier.
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:24.340]   But in the beginning, did you ever just take a pause in an interview and say,
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.220]   let me just take a minute to really like regroup and replan where this is going
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:30.340]   to go? Maybe you don't tell them exactly why,
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:34.820]   but what kind of things might we have found on the chopping floor?
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:39.660]   I will always tell people in advance that
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:44.500]   they should feel free to take a water break or a bathroom break and that they can
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.140]   also restate anything.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:50.020]   So if they get two sentences into a story and they're like, isn't that good?
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.420]   I want to start over. They can just say that, you know,
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.700]   let me just start that over. Take two seconds of silence, start over.
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:59.300]   Then we can clean it up. That also gives me the ability. And I'll say this.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.860]   I may need a water break or a bathroom break. That gives me the ability.
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.060]   If I need a breather, water, bathroom,
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.860]   or just to clear my head and figure out where's this going,
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:11.700]   where do I want to take this? Then I'll do that.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:16.540]   But my episodes are generally speaking,
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:19.860]   minimally edited, very minimally edited.
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:24.820]   Although the number of ticks will determine how much editing.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.940]   It is incredible how many smart people have
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:34.220]   atrocious verbal ticks. They will say like, like, like, like,
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:39.340]   like literally a hundred plus times in a 90
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:43.380]   minute interview. I do not exaggerate. Or someone will say, you know, you know,
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.940]   you know what I'm saying? Which is actually a very,
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:50.780]   I've noticed some gender patterns.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:55.820]   I know it's very unfashionable to talk about such things, but men,
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.420]   the, you know, you know, tends to be more of a male thing.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:04.700]   Across the board and like a lot of
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:09.100]   men say like, but it's especially noticeable for a lot of women,
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.020]   a lot of female guests.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:14.020]   It's kind of interesting that the ticks seem to skew in,
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:18.180]   in different genders and different directions. So, so dot, dot, dot,
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:23.100]   so dot, dot, dot, um, uh, uh, those are all very common.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:26.540]   There was one guest. I'm not going to name him by name,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:29.300]   although I think he'd find it funny. He said, uh,
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:32.700]   he had a really good one. He, he said, and whatnot, and he'd be like,
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:37.060]   and whatnot and whatnot. And he said it so often.
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:40.300]   And at the time I just didn't want to deal with having to edit it.
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:45.060]   So I left it in and he went into the office the day after the
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:49.540]   podcast had come out and all his coworkers started calling him Mr.
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:50.380]   Whatnot.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:57.300]   And you will absolutely notice that.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:01.940]   So I want my guests to sound as good as possible. If they're nervous,
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.860]   I will tell them that like, my job is to make you sound as good as possible.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:07.700]   If you're nervous, put that on me.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:13.020]   It is my responsibility as the interviewer to direct and
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:17.460]   shape and prompt in the best way possible. Just be yourself,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.900]   take any nerves and just put it on me. It's all on me.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.500]   So I will also say that if people are nervous, so that'd be a good example. Uh,
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:29.140]   dot, dot, dot. If you do it once or twice, it's fine and you can leave it in.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:33.740]   But if you hear that at the beginning of every answer, then it's a problem.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:38.780]   Another tick would be, that's a good question. That's a good question. Oh,
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.260]   that's a good question. That's a great question. Oh, that's a good question.
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.300]   You might hear that literally 20 times in one interview.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:47.060]   You got to clip that.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:52.340]   They just won't sound as good as they should otherwise.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:53.940]   And that's part of your responsibility.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:56.220]   But if you're just getting started,
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:59.940]   there's a product that I've used called Descript or Descript.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.460]   I don't know exactly. Yeah.
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.460]   And it makes it really easy to find these filler words.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.940]   I still find it needs some tweaking around the edges cause they're not perfect,
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:11.660]   but it's a great tool for like running through a transcript that's auto
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:12.500]   generated,
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:16.220]   but certainly cheaper than if you were paying someone to, you know,
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:17.700]   word for word, transcribe everything.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.820]   Absolutely.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.500]   And looking at another question that you sent me,
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.580]   because to lay out how this podcast came to be,
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.140]   you sent me a bunch of very good questions via email,
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:34.460]   which I requested after we had an initial conversation. And one of them,
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:39.300]   which I then asked to answer in this format.
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:42.740]   So I could point people to it is you seem to understand your audience. Well,
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.380]   how did you build that understanding? Did you survey them,
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.420]   ask for email feedback or something else? Okay.
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.060]   I'll give you the tactical answer.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.980]   And then I'm going to give you the principle behind most of my thinking.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.180]   I have surveyed my audience,
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:59.500]   but I haven't done that at length in many, many years.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:03.900]   The reason I surveyed my audience also was to gather demographic
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:07.100]   data, average household income,
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:12.060]   and many other things so that I could present that to sponsors.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:16.860]   Because at the time I had dozens of sponsors coming in and I could not answer
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:20.860]   those questions. Now with Facebook analytics,
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:23.340]   assuming you are present on multiple platforms,
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.540]   or your podcast is present on multiple platforms,
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.820]   you have many different ways that you can gather this data.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:32.660]   Now Facebook would be one. There are many other options I did survey,
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:37.540]   but I would say the way I've gotten to know my audience is this is going to be a
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:40.100]   very unsatisfying answer. Fortunately,
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:44.340]   I think there's a satisfying principle that comes after it is over
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:48.540]   more than a decade since four hour work week came out in 2007.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:51.900]   I started the blog, I want to say in 2005 or 2006,
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:57.540]   I have been growing and learning alongside my
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:01.340]   audience for 13 plus years now.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:07.140]   And you really get to know your audience and
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.980]   your audience will change over time.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.700]   So since launching the podcast, I would say my audience,
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.380]   my readership was 80/20,
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:20.540]   80% male, 20% female. Let's just keep it simple.
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:24.620]   I know that gender is a sensitive topic and there are more options,
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.940]   but let's just keep it basic for now.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:31.700]   I would say as of a few years ago,
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.300]   it's more 60/40 female male.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.260]   And I have changed over time somewhat blog, social
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:45.100]   blog, meaning blog comments, social media feedback.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:48.700]   These are all things that I pay some attention to,
[01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.820]   but that can quickly get overwhelming.
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:57.060]   So I would suggest that people
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.740]   listen to, I'll give you the upshot in a moment,
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:04.060]   but listen to my interview with Tim Urban,
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:07.260]   who has an incredible blog called Wait But Why.
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:12.220]   And if he had followed any of the advice for how to create a popular blog,
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:15.460]   by the way, he would not have done what he did. I mean, some of his pieces,
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:19.100]   I want to say are 30,000, 50,000 words. I mean, they're books.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:24.420]   Some of his multi-part blog posts are effectively books. They're long.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:28.180]   Not all of them are long. One of my favorites is the tail end.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:30.380]   It's not germane to what we're talking about with the tail end,
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:33.460]   just search the tail end by Tim Urban. Everyone should read it.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.500]   It will improve your life. It will improve how you relate to your family.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:41.140]   It's a must read. It'll take you 10 minutes, but he has talked,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:45.820]   and I think he also talked about this in Tribe Mentors about writing for his
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:50.020]   audience. And he said, it's really easy. And I'm paraphrasing here,
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:54.420]   but basically he imagines a huge stadium and
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:58.380]   each seat is filled by another Tim Urban.
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.740]   It's an entire stadium filled of himself.
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:08.740]   And he is just writing what he would want to read.
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.900]   And it sounds so simplistic.
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.980]   It sounds almost ridiculous.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:19.860]   And if it is incredibly simplistic,
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:22.660]   it is incredibly effective as well.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:28.100]   So if you know yourself and you pay attention to what excites you,
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:31.780]   you pay attention to your fears, you pay attention to the goals that you have,
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:34.620]   you pay attention to the things that you struggle with,
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:38.740]   even though you've tried to fix them before you pay attention to the things that
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:43.540]   bother you, you at least have a guaranteed market of one.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:46.380]   A lot of people fuck that up. They start speculating.
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:49.780]   And they're like a 22 year old guy. And they're like, you know what?
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.660]   I went to Wharton and I figured out doing all of these financial models and
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:54.500]   management consulting.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:59.500]   There's this huge opportunity for new moms who need blah,
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:02.460]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah for their kids. And, you know,
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:03.780]   regenerative blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.300]   They don't know anything about any of these things,
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:08.460]   but they've identified a huge market opportunity.
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:12.580]   And that is where they're going to focus their energies for building a company
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:16.780]   that can work. I'm not saying it can't work in terms of good financial outcomes.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:20.020]   Are they going to have a lot of fun doing it? Probably not.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:24.300]   In the world of podcasting, in the world of writing,
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:30.260]   don't assume you are someone of superhuman empathy and that you can guess what
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.340]   other people need.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:37.340]   Just focus on yourself and the personal will end up being the most universal.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.540]   If that makes sense. I'll give you an example.
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:42.900]   This might screw up the audio for a second,
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:47.580]   but I'm holding up an AirPods case. All right.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:50.420]   Now who else has an AirPods case, my girlfriend,
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.860]   and we mix up cases all the time.
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:59.700]   And it's a huge pain in the ass because sometimes I'll pick up what I think are
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.540]   mine.
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:05.700]   They're hers and the earbuds aren't even in the case they're upstairs somewhere.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:08.900]   And then I get to a coffee shop where I'm supposed to work or do something and I
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:09.900]   can't take a phone call.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.300]   And this problem has repeated itself over and over and over again.
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:18.540]   I tried to say use a Sharpie to write a name on the outside.
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:22.500]   Anyone who has tried that knows that it immediately gets rubbed off.
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:23.380]   Doesn't work.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:28.660]   So the solution that I figured out is you open the case and you just put your
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:31.900]   initials inside the divots at the very top.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:36.980]   So you can see T there at the top never gets worn off works every time.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:41.940]   And we have not mixed up our AirPods since this is the first time I'm talking
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:45.820]   about that, but I suspect I'm not the only person who has had this problem.
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:50.180]   There is a piece of blue masking tape on my wife's AirPods case,
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:54.060]   which does not fall off like marker. Yeah. So you could do that as well.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:57.300]   You could do the masking tape. I mean, there are multiple solutions here.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:01.860]   This is the one that worked for us. Great. Where to next?
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:08.340]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:10.620]   great addition to your new year routine.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.220]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:17.300]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:21.740]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:24.900]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:29.260]   So you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:31.060]   the cost of going out for coffee.
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:35.020]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade sign up for a
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:38.100]   subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:42.540]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.580]   it. And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade,
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:50.740]   but this last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe,
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:53.700]   it's called bark the moon and it's so delicious.
[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:57.840]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription. Right now,
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.300]   trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:05.700]   When you visit all the hacks.com/trade that's all the
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:10.340]   hacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans,
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:12.900]   all the hacks.com/trade.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:17.060]   Do you all remember episode one 22,
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:20.940]   when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your cooking at home?
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:23.420]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:27.660]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit,
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.180]   I was a skeptic at first,
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:32.860]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from any day,
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.580]   I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:40.940]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:43.500]   scratch in the microwave. And honestly,
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:47.820]   using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.220]   process so much.
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:53.940]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook serve store and
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:58.420]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer,
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.700]   and oven safe too.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.140]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure,
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:07.380]   I highly recommend David Chang's salmon rice. It is so good.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:12.180]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched last
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.180]   year, you have to check it out. So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:21.460]   go to all the hacks.com/anyday. Again,
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:26.140]   that's all the hacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:31.260]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:36.580]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.780]   deals, and discounts from our partners.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.060]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:45.500]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.300]   So the audience thing is interesting.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.660]   I know you're someone who likes stats and analyzing the data.
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.420]   There is some interesting data that I'm not sure if it even makes sense to do
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:00.260]   anything with. So you've got your downloads per episode.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:03.780]   You've got these charts that Apple and Spotify give you of like,
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:08.100]   where do people drop off in a episode? Do you look at that data?
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.220]   Do you do anything with it? Do you completely ignore it?
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:14.620]   I do pay attention to downloads. Not a lot of attention.
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.540]   I haven't looked at my stats in weeks,
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:21.620]   but if an episode does unusually well,
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:25.740]   if it's several standard deviations, say away from other episodes,
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.580]   and there isn't an easy explanation for it.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:33.500]   So if I have LeBron James on the podcast as an example, which I did,
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.100]   then if that episode is a runaway hit,
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:41.300]   I'm not going to be that surprised because some of what was featured in the
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:45.660]   episode is picked up by ESPN and different comments are quoted all over the
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.780]   place. So there's a lot of carry,
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:51.620]   but if there's an outlier that isn't easily explained,
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:55.340]   then I want to take a close look at that.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:59.180]   If there's an underperformer that isn't easily explained,
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.500]   I also want to take a close look at that.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:06.860]   Determining any causality whatsoever is really difficult
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:12.020]   unless there's a technical problem. So very often, if there is an underperformer,
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:15.140]   the first thing that we look for are technical problems.
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.660]   Was there an issue with any of the major platforms?
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.940]   And that is important to keep an eye on.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:28.340]   But I have not found the vast majority of data
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:32.660]   that is easy to collect or to find to be that actionable.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.940]   But I'd be curious to hear your perspective because things have changed and the
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:36.940]   tools have become better,
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.860]   but still I think it is tempting to
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:47.500]   conclude causality with say an N of one with one episode that
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.500]   does something strange.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:53.700]   It's very, very hard with any conviction for me to say that
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:55.060]   that's going to be an accurate read.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:55:00.900]   I have not found anything super effective to use with kind of the
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.220]   standard platform analytics. Every now and then I'm like, wow,
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:05.460]   that episode did a little better.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.820]   I haven't seen any major order of magnitude changes. You know,
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:11.900]   there's been this one's 10% up, 10% down.
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.460]   I kind of attribute that to all kinds of randomness. Yeah.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:19.700]   The one thing that I will say, maybe this falls under analytics and it's a,
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:24.100]   another tip from Kevin Rose was chartable is a
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:27.060]   platform that you can use for lots of analytics things.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:31.740]   But the one thing they do that's really cool is if you put their prefix in
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:36.420]   front of your feed, which means every episode just gets hosted on a
[01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:39.260]   platform, you can tell your hosting platform, Hey,
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:44.300]   make sure the URL include this other thing also so that someone else sees
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:49.140]   whenever that's requested. And so you can create a link. So, you know,
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:54.100]   if this were on my show, it'd be link.chartable.com/athtim.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:59.660]   And then chartable will say what IP address went to the link and
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:03.740]   then look for whether that IP address actually requested an episode.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:08.220]   And so you can go and say, here's a link to promote an episode.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:09.740]   You can put it on different social channels.
[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:13.540]   You could give it to a guest if they want to promote it and you could see which
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:16.900]   channels are actually converting to downloads,
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:20.420]   which I think is something that it's always easy to see who clicked what,
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.100]   but did they actually listen to the episode?
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:25.500]   Now you can't find out how many minutes they listened to or anything like that,
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:30.020]   but it's at least one piece of evidence to support what to do.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:33.260]   And I used it to make a decision, which was interesting.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:37.180]   When you are promoting an episode, you basically have two choices.
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.780]   You can send a link to every platform out there, which some people do.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.220]   They go on Twitter and they're like, check out my new episode.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:46.500]   Here it is on iTunes. And here it is on Google. And here it is on Spotify.
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:47.620]   And here it is here, here, here.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:53.020]   Or you can link to a site like your own website where it's click here.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:56.180]   And now there's like seven player buttons where the individual listener could
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:01.060]   jump off to or chartable will let you say, if someone opens out an iPhone,
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:05.260]   just directly take them to the podcast app, which is great. If they use that,
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.060]   it's probably a terrible experience if they're a Spotify or an overcast
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:11.860]   listener. So I actually tested out one episode. I did one way,
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:13.740]   one I did the other way when I did the next way.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:16.460]   And I just looked at which one of those links converted better.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:21.340]   And the best conversion was sending them to my website with the player
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:25.420]   links on it, then trying to guess or listing multiple things.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:31.700]   What success is depends on how you define success and what metrics
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.500]   constitute success for you.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.980]   So one could be increasing downloads.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:43.420]   Another could be increasing plays,
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:44.900]   which is a lot trickier,
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:50.020]   although different platforms count downloads
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.020]   and plays differently.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:56.060]   So you might have automatic downloads in the background
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:59.540]   on Apple things may have changed, but at least a few years ago,
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:01.620]   that was the case. And that would count as a download,
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:02.980]   even if it were never touched,
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:07.580]   never seen by the person who owns that iPhone versus say on Spotify,
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.380]   if someone clicks play that counts,
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:12.380]   and then people might look at their analytics and conclude, Oh,
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:17.340]   Spotify is only 5% of my downloads and quotation marks.
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:21.540]   Therefore I really don't need to pay attention to it. Whereas in reality,
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:25.260]   maybe it's 20 or 30% or more of your actual plays.
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.980]   So it's important to understand the limitations and the
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:32.660]   mechanics of some of these platforms.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:37.380]   I would also say an additional benefit of sending people to your website is that
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:41.740]   you can offer or incentivize
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:46.420]   them to sign up for something like a newsletter, because as it stands,
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:51.980]   if you are publishing through an RSS feed in the way that most people do,
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:56.060]   you do not have a direct relationship, or I should say,
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:59:00.140]   you don't have the ability to communicate effectively directly with
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.100]   the people who listened to your podcast.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:06.620]   And I view that as a problem in the same way that I view any
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:10.620]   business based on a single platform as highly vulnerable.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:15.140]   I remember talking to somebody who had, it was, it was something like, I don't know,
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:20.020]   $10 million a year business built on a Facebook page of some
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:24.860]   type Facebook pages. And I, and I asked them how that was going for them.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.460]   And they said, well, it's going great,
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:31.380]   but it feels like I have the most profitable McDonald's in the world built
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:33.060]   on top of an active volcano.
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:40.820]   Any moment at any moment, the algorithm could be changed.
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.540]   Suddenly, Oh, you're a business page. Okay.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:46.900]   Now we're going to throttle your organic reach to like 10% of your audience.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:51.020]   And you're going to have to pay to reach the people you thought or guaranteed to
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:54.660]   see your message. I don't like that. I don't like that risk.
[01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.340]   And therefore for me,
[01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:01.580]   at least one of the core
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:06.300]   drivers for using the newsletter as I have, you know,
[02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:10.260]   five bullet Fridays is the most popular aspect of the newsletter, which is free.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.460]   So listeners, you can find that@tim.blogspot.com/friday.
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:18.100]   I've been doing that for a long time now is to
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:23.700]   establish a direct line of communication with my listeners and
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:28.780]   readers. And quite frankly, also because text is my native
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.380]   language, everything started with books.
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:36.060]   And so in the same way that Rogan is really, really, really, really good on video,
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:39.660]   it's also quite clever via text. I mean, I think his, his, there,
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:43.500]   there are many good reasons why he is incredibly popular on Instagram.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:47.260]   I mean, some of his, some of his captions and so on are exceptional and they're
[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:50.060]   long. Some of them, for me,
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:53.340]   that translates to feeling very comfortable, very competent,
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:58.060]   very good about the newsletter writing five bullet Friday is
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:00.660]   therapeutic for me. So it is in a way,
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:04.740]   a diary and self-therapy and
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:08.540]   quote unquote marketing all in one, which is great.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.540]   So those are a few thoughts,
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:15.860]   but I don't pay a lot of attention to data,
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:17.820]   but I will look at trend lines over time.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:21.460]   And if there's some type of catalyzing event or concern,
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:26.180]   especially due to technical problems or new policies on platforms,
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.940]   then I'll take a quick look at that.
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:32.460]   But the fact of the matter is I wouldn't pay too much attention to data or
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:35.980]   specific data sets until you've asked yourself,
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:40.460]   what action will I take or not take,
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.940]   or what behavioral will change based on looking at this data set.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.900]   And if the answer is none and none do something else,
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.660]   unless you're just,
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:54.740]   it nurtures your soul and kind of tickles your nuts to
[02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:58.900]   chew on data. If that's just your fun, that's your recreation. Great.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.020]   Have fun. But otherwise I wouldn't pay too much attention to it.
[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:07.260]   So one of the most common things I think people look at data for,
[02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:08.900]   and it's not clear, like you said,
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:13.660]   that they would do anything about it is to try to see if their audience is
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:16.300]   growing. Yep. So I know you said, don't think about growth,
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:17.420]   but we can come back to growth.
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:22.340]   I think one of the interesting things is a lot of people have podcasts,
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:24.860]   good content. And, you know,
[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:28.140]   I've been asked to go on some podcasts where they get a hundred,
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:32.020]   200 downloads an episode, and they're just not breaking out,
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:33.500]   but it's not because they don't have good content.
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:35.620]   You obviously came into this.
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:37.820]   I remember you said that when you launched your podcast,
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:40.100]   it was the number one podcast in iTunes. Yep.
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:43.620]   I know you get a boost when you launch, but not everyone has that.
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:48.420]   Do you think other than good content is growth,
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:52.820]   something you think people should spend any time on because people have to find
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.180]   that good content? Sure. I think growth,
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:00.900]   I think awareness is perfectly valid to
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:04.020]   focus on. And I do pay attention to growth.
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:06.540]   I do track,
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:11.340]   I'm very well aware of like the average number of downloads at week two at week
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:14.860]   six per episode and total number of downloads.
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:18.540]   And I do pay attention to a handful of key metrics.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.860]   I just don't,
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.980]   I don't pay attention to them to the extent that they become a
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:29.300]   distraction from things that I think are more important.
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.740]   But in the beginning for sure, I launched, like I said,
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:36.580]   2014 and the ecosystem has exploded since
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:40.940]   competition is, I mean, probably a million X what it was. I mean,
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:45.260]   at least a few thousand X what it was. Although I would say just a,
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:48.380]   just because there are a lot of podcasts doesn't mean automatically that you
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.420]   have competition competition for what,
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:55.340]   what is the scarce resource that you are competing for? If not,
[02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:58.620]   why is it a competition? It's an ego thing. What is the competition?
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:02.380]   I think these are questions worth asking, but let's come back to growth.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:04.980]   So when I launched in 2014, I should also say,
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:09.820]   there were people who said to me that ship has sailed.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:14.860]   It's too late. There's no point doing a podcast in 2014.
[02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:18.820]   So I think they were wrong then.
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.180]   And the people who say that now, I also think are wrong.
[02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:27.300]   It's still very, very early. Think about it. I mean,
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:32.340]   Amazon has only come into this space in a big way, very recently.
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:36.740]   And they're very quietly, I suspect doing lots of interesting things,
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:40.980]   but they have not thrown all their weight behind this.
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.780]   And they have a lot of weight to throw. That is just one example.
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:48.100]   We are so early still, I think,
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:52.820]   but with respect to what has helped
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:56.700]   increase downloads, I would say,
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:05:00.980]   being on other podcasts, first and foremost,
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.220]   helped drive subscribers.
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:08.940]   You need to be explicit about asking people to go to the podcast and being
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:12.180]   explicit with the host that that is why you are coming on the podcast.
[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:16.180]   Otherwise, I don't think there's automatically a high conversion rate.
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:20.980]   People who listen to podcasts probably listen to more than one podcast.
[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:26.460]   So I do think that there is a fair amount of transference when you're on other
[02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:31.180]   podcasts and it makes you a better podcaster to be on other well-run
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:36.020]   podcasts. So you can take notes on process, how they prep you,
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:37.500]   what technology they use,
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:41.860]   what did they do or not do that you could adapt or not adapt?
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:44.060]   What are you doing that you might want to discard?
[02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:47.660]   So there is an educational part also to being on other podcasts that you might
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:50.100]   not get from pursuing growth through other channels.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:55.180]   I think that newsletters are also very powerful,
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.420]   email and newsletters.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:01.140]   They're powerful for everything because they are one link click
[02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:04.340]   away from whatever the desired action is.
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.420]   So those would be two that come to mind.
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:12.220]   And there are other ways to increase
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:17.660]   downloads and subscribers. Certainly big names don't hurt,
[02:06:17.660 --> 02:06:21.020]   but it's one thing to get somebody to your podcast.
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:25.260]   It's another to have them stick around and be an active listener.
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:30.380]   So if you get a celebrity on and they are
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:34.140]   mediocre at best, is someone going to listen to a second episode?
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:38.460]   I would guess not. They might have an automatic download,
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:41.140]   but what is it that you actually care about the download number or the number of
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:43.860]   active listeners? I care about the number of active listeners for a lot of
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:47.940]   reasons. Hard to confirm what the active listenership is,
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:50.620]   but big names definitely help, right?
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:53.900]   The Arnold Schwarzenegger episode and the amount of promotion that I then did
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:58.780]   behind it, right? So I do use paid acquisition,
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:00.860]   advertising, things of this type,
[02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:07.140]   having a name to really put
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:09.900]   a lot of the machine behind and muscle behind,
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:14.700]   which could be as simple as a basic campaign on your
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:15.980]   platform of choice.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:19.700]   That doesn't necessitate having a blog and so on. Like I do.
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:22.140]   I think that is certainly helpful,
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:26.220]   but it's a temptation that needs to be tempered because you could spend all your
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.940]   time chasing big names. And I think it's a fool's errand.
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:32.340]   As I mentioned earlier, certainly video,
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:37.500]   I think YouTube TikTok to some extent, certainly.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:41.980]   Although I think Andrew Chen has written some very interesting pieces about
[02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:46.740]   TikTok and its effects on virality and some perhaps unintended or unknown
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:51.460]   consequences of sudden influx. So people can, can Google that and find it.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:56.340]   YouTube can be extremely helpful. And I've seen that with many podcasts.
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:08:01.460]   Now it's, it's not just limited to Joe Rogan. You have many examples.
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:03.380]   I mean, Jordan Peterson would be another example.
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:06.060]   There are probably thousands of examples,
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:10.260]   but I could certainly think of it a dozen offhand who use video very, very well.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:15.540]   Those are a few and PR PR. You get,
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:19.500]   if you want to practice your chops with getting out in other types of media
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:24.140]   outside of podcasting, then knock yourself out.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:25.220]   You could do that as well.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.100]   When you said video,
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:30.580]   I noticed you have two kinds of podcast videos on your YouTube channel.
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.460]   You've got the static image of the cover art and the guest and just
[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:40.180]   playing the audio. And then the actual interview are both of those
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:44.900]   effective, or do you really think the real boost comes when you have video
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:48.380]   content? The real boost comes from video content for sure. Yeah.
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:52.780]   The static images are placeholders from audio only interviews.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.980]   Yeah. So to put them on YouTube,
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:09:00.460]   we choose a cover page of some type and that is what people
[02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:03.820]   see, but for sure, actual video,
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:09.500]   moving images makes the biggest difference. And I will say, you know,
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.500]   that I suspect a lot of people are going to be very disappointed with my answers
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:17.220]   on growth here. And I will say,
[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:19.980]   and this is such an old man thing to say, but I'll say it anyway.
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:25.300]   There is no magic bullet for growth and the
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:26.580]   tools change.
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:31.580]   So I would suggest getting a book like the 22 immutable
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:36.300]   laws of marketing, reading a short chapter called the law of category.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:41.060]   I believe I put an updated slash edited version of that in either tools of
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:45.580]   Titans or tribe mentors, because I think it's that valuable read the law of
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:50.940]   category read 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly, which you can find on kk.org.
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:53.940]   These will give you principles,
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:57.900]   adaptable principles that will allow you to build a unique
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.460]   position in the minds of people who will become diehard
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.540]   evangelists. If you do that,
[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:11.140]   which takes consistency over time and it takes focus more than anything else.
[02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:16.900]   A lot of the other dominoes will tip over without any
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:17.740]   additional effort.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:23.700]   But if instead of learning how to draw as an analogy,
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:27.380]   you're focused on whether you should use a ballpoint pen or a fountain pen or
[02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:30.340]   pastels or crayons or watercolors,
[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:35.740]   meaning the different technologies and tools clubhouse versus
[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:40.420]   Tik TOK versus Instagram versus Oh, Vine. Remember that? Oops. Oh,
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:45.820]   if your promotional engine was based on that, Oh, Facebook business pages. Oh,
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:49.660]   yeah. You're going to need to boost to reach your audience. Now.
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:50.660]   Sorry about that.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:55.540]   There's too much fragility in a tactics or tools based approach.
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.380]   So I think the principles are most important,
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:02.820]   but I recognize also that perhaps I am just too far from the
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:07.100]   nascent years in which I built my blog following
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:11.860]   to provide a good answer. I will say though, that I built a very, very, very,
[02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:15.980]   very popular blog when practically no one knew who the hell I was.
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:19.940]   And I did that by writing posts that I hoped
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:25.180]   10% of my then very small audience would love.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:29.820]   I did not write posts that I wanted a hundred percent of my audience to
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:34.140]   like. And I do the same thing with podcasting. I think it works really well.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:38.460]   So I do not expect my entire audience to love any episode.
[02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:41.020]   And if I tried to do that, I think I would shoot myself in the foot.
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:46.500]   I expect that my active audience will be in a rotation
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:51.460]   and every fourth or fifth or maybe 10th episode,
[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:54.340]   they will love so much that they will send it to 10 of their friends.
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:59.540]   That is how I think about it. And I, I believe at least so far,
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.100]   it has been extremely, extremely effective.
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:06.140]   One of the pieces of feedback someone gave me on my show was that not every
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:07.580]   episode is relevant to them.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:11.900]   I did an episode where I interviewed a professional car buyer and they were like,
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.980]   I don't have a car. So this episode is pointless. They're like,
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:18.620]   maybe you should change the show so that everything's always relevant to
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.620]   everyone. And my answer was, I don't know, I'm going to buy a car.
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:24.820]   I wanted to talk to someone that professionally does this.
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:28.660]   And that's super interesting to me. So just skip it and go to the next one.
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:32.300]   Do you feel similarly? You said, you know, one in five to 10 people love that
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:33.980]   episode. Do you care or,
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:37.740]   or do you think they're listening to the other five to nine episodes?
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:38.940]   I don't care.
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:43.940]   I literally spend zero time thinking about it because,
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:49.860]   and this, this might sound strange, but for me to be, for me to have fun,
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:55.580]   for this to be a joyful experience that I look forward to,
[02:12:56.140 --> 02:13:00.540]   the podcast needs to have a certain essence,
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:05.540]   a certain pull for me, and it has to have a certain dosage.
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.260]   So I have a very infrequent podcast.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:12.460]   I do it on average four times per month,
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:15.260]   or I publish four long form episodes per month.
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:18.460]   We didn't really talk about recording cadence, which we could talk about,
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:22.060]   but on average, I publish four long form interviews per month.
[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:23.980]   At one point it was six episodes.
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:26.500]   And then I noticed a few months into doing that,
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:30.380]   I was starting to drag my feet a little bit.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:35.460]   And it began to feel like a job, like an obligation.
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:39.620]   And I noted that quickly, thankfully. And I said, this is no good.
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:42.860]   If I keep this up, I'm going to stop doing the podcast,
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:47.380]   or I'm just going to be unhappy doing it. In which case,
[02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:49.300]   what the fuck am I doing? Cause I don't need to do it.
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:54.780]   And I then ratcheted back the frequency of the podcast to the point
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:58.540]   where it felt good. There's a dosage question,
[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:03.740]   i.e. frequency. There's also an essence pull question. So for me,
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:08.500]   I have to follow my own interest and to be of a
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:11.060]   good steward of my own self-care,
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:14.580]   but to also be of greatest service to the people who are listening,
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:18.500]   I need to keep doing this, or at least I hope to keep doing it.
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:21.140]   Maybe I don't need to, but I would like to keep doing this,
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:25.380]   and to be able to grow over time and share those lessons.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:30.060]   The only way I'm going to do that is if I am drawn to
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:32.300]   continue doing this because I enjoy it.
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:37.100]   So if I decide to do an episode with a violin appraiser,
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:40.780]   and it gets 10 listeners, I don't fucking care at all.
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:44.060]   As long as I enjoy the episode, I do not care.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:46.860]   And I will say that over time,
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:52.860]   that not caring is the ultimate form of caring because you
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:57.700]   can cultivate an audience who is interested in
[02:14:57.700 --> 02:14:59.260]   stepping into weird,
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:03.660]   strange corners of the world into
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.340]   interests and professions and lives that they perhaps otherwise would have
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:10.340]   ignored or avoided.
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:15.100]   So your audience will also change in how they relate to you
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:20.020]   over time. And at least in my experience,
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:25.100]   they I hope have realized that sometimes it is the
[02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:29.260]   episode they least would have expected to want to listen to,
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:34.300]   that they end up liking the most of perhaps the last 20 episodes I've
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:34.780]   done.
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:39.460]   So I think my listeners are more and more willing to give me the
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:41.660]   benefit of the doubt and try something strange.
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:45.420]   Yeah. I got some feedback from Joe Saul Sehai,
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:47.700]   who runs a podcast called the Stacking Benjamins,
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:50.900]   which is a funny like kind of different style podcast.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:55.300]   But he said the interesting thing you have to realize with guests is someone
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:59.140]   might listen to the episode for the guest, but at the end of the day,
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:01.300]   they're subscribing and coming back for you.
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:06.460]   And so the nature of interviews though often is we're trying to
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:09.340]   highlight the guest and hear their stories,
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.060]   which inherently if done well, is them talking more than you.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:16.140]   You mentioned earlier, if it's a bad guest,
[02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:17.860]   it might be you talking much more than them.
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:22.940]   How do you make sure you interject enough of Tim into the podcast that new
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:27.660]   listeners and recurring listeners get that when the focus of each episode is,
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:29.020]   is always on someone else?
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:31.820]   That is a really good question.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:36.300]   And the answer is I don't think about it at all.
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:42.300]   But there are some times when I will interject and it has a
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:45.620]   strategic purpose or a practical purpose.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:49.460]   There are interviews where I basically don't talk at all.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:56.140]   And if someone is just, you know,
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:00.220]   a woman or a man possessed and they are in flow, I will let them riff.
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:04.660]   It'll just be an audio book of that person for an hour or two hours.
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:08.380]   You can listen to Tim Ferriss and Bology.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:13.060]   That's an example of that, the four hour,
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:18.180]   every topic under the sun covered podcast,
[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:23.220]   which was quite an experience to be on the receiving end of also great episode,
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:25.620]   very unusual.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:29.780]   And one of the best performing podcasts probably of the last year for me,
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:30.620]   which is saying a lot.
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:35.060]   So if people look up my name or just go to Tim dot blog and search Bology,
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:38.460]   B-A-L-A-J-I. Yeah.
[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:42.420]   Put in a mouth guard and drink a few cups of coffee and prepare yourself for the
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:43.780]   onslaught. It's quite something,
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:49.100]   but I will interject in a few
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:49.940]   instances.
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:55.860]   One is where I know I'm asking a question or I suspect
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:56.700]   I'm asking a question.
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:18:00.820]   The guest is going to have trouble answering unless they have some time to think
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:03.980]   about it. So for instance,
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:09.980]   if I ask them, what is one of the best investments you've ever made,
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:14.100]   which by the way is better than what's the best investment you've ever made in
[02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:18.700]   the same way that what is one of the books you have gifted the most for other
[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:22.780]   people is better than what's the best book you've ever read.
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:25.220]   The search function is a lot harder.
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:29.540]   It's going to take them much longer to try to come up with a single answer.
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:32.660]   And they will generally default to recency.
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:34.460]   They'll come up with something that happened recent.
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:38.860]   So you don't get the best answers. If I ask someone,
[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:43.140]   for instance, what is one of the best investments you've ever made?
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:47.660]   And then I might buy them time by giving some examples. I'll say,
[02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:50.420]   let me give you a few examples and give you a second to think about it.
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:55.500]   It could be an investment of money, like so-and-so say Warren Buffett,
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:59.820]   who invested in Dale Carnegie speaking classes for public speaking.
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:03.940]   And he always cites that as his best ever investment because it has multiplied
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:08.060]   and magnified his ability to do everything else.
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:11.380]   It has been a supercharger for all of his other skills and talents.
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:17.100]   It could be buying an entrance ticket to a competition
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:21.740]   that allowed you to prove yourself that then led to
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:26.580]   X. It could be an investment of energy. It could be anything. Okay.
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:31.260]   I just gave everyone listening and you 45 to 60
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:33.580]   seconds to think about an answer,
[02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:37.860]   as opposed to off the cuff coming up with something as quickly as possible.
[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:43.380]   Fortunately, you can take that approach, or if you're not recording live,
[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:48.740]   you can just say, take your time. We're not recording this live.
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:51.340]   You can take 30 seconds in silence to think about it.
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:56.420]   And then we can talk, but that feels strange to a lot of people,
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.500]   even though you can do that for a production standpoint,
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:03.260]   sitting in a conversation in silence,
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:07.660]   waiting for a minute for someone to answer feels unnatural and weird.
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:13.860]   So I will interject in a case like that very frequently when I speak
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:14.260]   up,
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:19.260]   it is to buy time for the interviewee and to give them a
[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:24.060]   few examples to act as like auxiliary search
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:25.540]   functions in their own brains.
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:27.340]   They can come up with the best possible answer.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:30.620]   Yeah. I was thinking the whole time about my, my best investment.
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:33.620]   Well, what is one of your best investments?
[02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:36.740]   Well, it's funny when I moved out to the Bay area,
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:40.220]   I didn't know anyone and I had recently been laid off.
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:41.500]   And so I didn't have any money,
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:45.220]   but I invested in a membership at the climbing gym down the street.
[02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:49.420]   And at the time I thought this is climbing gyms are not cheap gyms.
[02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:51.620]   There's cheaper gyms, but through the climbing gym,
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:55.460]   I met a guy named Daniel Berka who was at day through Daniel.
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:56.460]   I met Kevin through Kevin.
[02:20:56.460 --> 02:20:56.700]   I was like,
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:59.980]   it's literally probably the investment that ended up building out my entire
[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:03.740]   network, including being here. But at the time it seemed, you know,
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:07.340]   it was like a hundred and 120 bucks a month. It seemed crazy, but yeah.
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:09.860]   Yeah. That's amazing. Was that mission cliffs or where were you?
[02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:13.300]   It was mission cliffs. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great gym.
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:15.460]   I remember mission cliffs back up back in the day.
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:20.500]   So that's a fun question to ask. If I asked someone about favorite failures,
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.580]   just the phrasing of the question is very confusing for a lot of people.
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.860]   So then I'll give them an example.
[02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:29.900]   And the other time that I'll chime in as if the
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:33.420]   interview is drowning in boredom
[02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:37.700]   as a rescue attempt.
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:40.020]   So that's a lot about, about Tim.
[02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:43.220]   So I want to talk a little bit about the transition early.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:45.900]   Tim was really just the four hour guy, right?
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.500]   You had three books in a row where that was the theme.
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.780]   Someone told me once they said, Hey, you know,
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:53.860]   your cover art for an episode of podcast, everything,
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:55.460]   nothing has anything about you on it.
[02:21:55.460 --> 02:22:00.140]   So I took a similar early on approach where this story of the
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:03.460]   show is all about what the show's about all the hacks.
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:06.700]   It's not about me at all. And people are like, well, who are you?
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:10.260]   And you made a transition. Now your podcast is, you know, the Tim Ferriss show.
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:11.700]   It's nothing to do with four hour.
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:15.260]   I get the sense that you're trying to run away from being the four hour guy,
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:18.540]   but how have you thought about that transition and,
[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:23.220]   and making it and making a brand that is really about you
[02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:25.620]   instead of something else?
[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:29.980]   I'm going to tackle this from oblique
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:34.500]   angle and I'll
[02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:38.500]   couch it under the umbrella of identity diversification
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:41.820]   and also optionality.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:44.820]   So flashing back to the four hour work week,
[02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:49.660]   four hour work week was this huge unexpected hit.
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:54.940]   The state on the New York times list for four to five years straight every week.
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:23:00.660]   And it created an abundance
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:04.860]   of inbound opportunity. Almost all the requests
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:08.460]   were expectedly related to the four hour work week.
[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:09.860]   So I was the four hour work week guy.
[02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:12.340]   We want you to give a talk on the principles of the four hour work week.
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:16.780]   You want me to do consulting to help us improve efficiency and
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:19.820]   per hour yield within this organization.
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:22.260]   We want you to do this workshop.
[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:26.500]   We want you to license the name so we can
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:31.220]   develop A, B, C, D, and E. We want to option it for a movie,
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:34.060]   which is almost always a dead end. By the way, if people are wondering,
[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:38.060]   we want to talk to you about a musical. We want to do this. We want to do that.
[02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:40.940]   Most of those things all came to zero,
[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:45.780]   but all of the external pressures
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:50.460]   were to milk that for everything that it was worth. In other words,
[02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:54.860]   I would write the four hour work week volume two,
[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:57.260]   or I would write the three hour work week.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:01.700]   I would continue to beat that drum until
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:05.500]   I had shaggy gray eyebrows and
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:09.340]   could bang the drum no more. That was going to be me.
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:14.460]   And I saw many authors around me
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:17.740]   who I met on the speaking circuit early on when I did that.
[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:22.140]   I no longer, and for many years, have done no paid speaking,
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:27.260]   which was a categorical decision and policy that was one of those
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:31.700]   decisions that removes a thousand decisions for many reasons we could talk
[02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:35.860]   about. The short answer is I was repeating myself.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:39.700]   And when you repeat yourself, this is relevant to my point.
[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:44.380]   When you repeat the same messages, as my friend,
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:47.460]   Josh Waits can point out to me, you begin to calcify your thinking.
[02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:53.780]   And you're also repeating it because you are being paid
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:55.380]   for this perishable product,
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:25:00.100]   which is speaking to audiences over and over again about the same
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:00.940]   thing.
[02:25:00.940 --> 02:25:06.700]   And I recognized I did not want to be many of the
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:10.820]   people I met who had been milking the same thing for a very long time.
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:12.780]   They didn't seem particularly happy about it.
[02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:15.260]   They didn't seem energized by it.
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:20.060]   They seemed drained and they seemed to feel trapped to
[02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:23.260]   me, which is why, given the success of the book,
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:26.340]   I decided to maintain,
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:29.660]   preserve the brand recognition of 4-Hour,
[02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:32.100]   but move it into physical performance with the 4-Hour body,
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:37.380]   because I recognized I might never have this chance again
[02:25:37.380 --> 02:25:38.780]   to step out,
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:42.420]   to have license to go to a completely different section of the bookstore,
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:43.780]   a completely different subject matter,
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:47.660]   but I could always go back to the 4-Hour Workweek.
[02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:52.180]   So I could always return to that comfortable, familiar,
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:55.540]   well-worn path of these principles outlined in the 4-Hour Workweek.
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:59.180]   So this is, I think, an important part of the backstory.
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:04.140]   So I decided to go to 4-Hour Body. 4-Hour Body does extremely well.
[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:08.020]   4-Hour Body hits number one, New York Times, still sells extremely well.
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:13.780]   And that then bought me the license to write
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:16.300]   the 4-Hour Chef, where I'm taking these principles,
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.980]   which also come up in your podcast a fair amount with Andy Ratcliffe recently
[02:26:19.980 --> 02:26:23.420]   of Wealthfront, the 80/20 principle.
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:27.820]   So Pareto's law and many different
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:32.780]   principles that you could apply to deconstructing entrepreneurship and
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:35.580]   testing assumptions apply equally to physical performance.
[02:26:35.580 --> 02:26:39.540]   They apply equally to accelerated learning, language acquisition,
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:40.700]   cooking doesn't matter.
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:46.260]   So now I had proven to the people who pay me,
[02:26:46.260 --> 02:26:48.220]   at least upfront, the publishers,
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:53.260]   and also proven to my audience that what was interesting
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:58.900]   was the adventures and the principles, not any specific subject matter.
[02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:02.140]   It's hard for me to overstate how important that is.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.140]   I was no longer trapped in one section of the bookstore.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:09.300]   I could write about anything I wanted. Now I had license to do that. Okay.
[02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:13.900]   The 4-Hour Chef almost killed me.
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:17.580]   It was an incredibly complex, extremely difficult project.
[02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:20.940]   It was the first major acquisition by Amazon Publishing when they were really
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:24.620]   stepping into publishing in a big way. The entire publishing world freaked out.
[02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:27.380]   Barnes and Noble wouldn't carry the book. I mean,
[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:31.540]   it was exciting and also a huge mess on many levels.
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:34.500]   And each book launch,
[02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:40.380]   I would talk to best-selling authors who had
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:42.340]   launched in the preceding, say, 12 months.
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.420]   And I would ask them which channels, tools,
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:50.180]   and outlets did less than they expected or were waning in importance and
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:54.980]   impact and which did more than they expected and seemed to be
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:58.300]   in a scent. So for the 4-Hour Workweek,
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:01.420]   blogs were neglected, largely. I mean,
[02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:04.820]   blogs were incredibly powerful and neglected. That's where I focused.
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:08.020]   With the 4-Hour Body,
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:11.420]   I asked the same questions and I explored a bunch of different channels.
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:15.500]   For the 4-Hour Chef, the medium and the tool,
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:19.700]   the channel that was most undervalued but most impactful was
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:23.940]   podcasting. So I focused on podcasting for the launch of the 4-Hour Chef.
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:26.980]   And these podcasts had incredible impact,
[02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:31.340]   much more impact than huge television shows.
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:35.540]   And in the process of doing that,
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:40.580]   I really realized how much I enjoyed the long-form conversations where you
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.900]   could be yourself, you could drop an F-bomb if need be,
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:47.860]   or if that was your penchant for just speaking casually and
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:51.220]   comfortably versus, say, being on morning television,
[02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:55.780]   which can have some impact but seemed to have less and less of an impact
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:59.540]   where someone is staring over your shoulder at a teleprompter and you literally
[02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:04.180]   have 30 seconds to talk after spending like an hour waiting in the green room
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:09.060]   after having your face spray-painted with makeup and you woke up at 5am to get
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:13.020]   there. It's not that enjoyable an experience. So I saw the impact.
[02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:16.980]   I enjoyed the podcasting and decided then at that point,
[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:19.020]   I'm going to take a big break from books.
[02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:22.340]   Not sure I'm ever going to write another book, but in the meantime,
[02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:27.700]   I'd like to experiment with this podcasting format and see what it's like to be
[02:29:27.700 --> 02:29:29.660]   in the director's seat, so to speak.
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:35.740]   And the only reason the podcast ended up with the Tim Ferriss Show as the name
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:37.220]   is I couldn't come up with a name.
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:41.780]   And Kevin called it Tim Tim Talk Talk in the first episode,
[02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:44.900]   which long-term listeners still joke about. And I still joke,
[02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:46.700]   Kevin and I still joke about,
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:50.860]   but came up with all of these different names for it.
[02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:54.140]   And the fact of the matter was at that time,
[02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:58.380]   there were only two things that had a lot of brand recognition.
[02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:03.740]   The four hour shtick, which I didn't want to extend.
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:08.380]   I wanted to retire that Jersey or my name.
[02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:13.740]   And that is the reason that I decided to use the name.
[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:18.460]   But if you're just starting a podcast and you don't have any name recognition,
[02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:22.780]   I don't think that the logic automatically follows that you should use your
[02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:25.900]   name. Now it's been a wonderful trip.
[02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:30.900]   I will say that there are drawbacks to launching a
[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:35.300]   podcast with your name in the same way that their drawbacks to founding a company
[02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:39.660]   that can only be run by you. As we've seen in the news,
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:44.380]   there are a lot of big deals by podcast standards happening.
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:49.340]   At the moment, there is a land grab for talent and big shows and audience.
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:53.300]   So you have Joe Rogan purportedly a hundred million dollar deal.
[02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:55.660]   I actually think if I had to guess, I don't know this,
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:59.020]   but I would suspect it is substantially larger than that over time with earn
[02:30:59.020 --> 02:31:03.020]   outs and so on and performance bonuses, I would guess it's much larger than that.
[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:07.340]   I think there was somewhere between 60 and a hundred million dollar deal for
[02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:11.980]   Dax Shepard, something like a $60 million deal for
[02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:14.820]   call her daddy. I think that's a three-year deal.
[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:19.980]   You will notice that the deal terms appear to be getting more
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.500]   and more onerous. Now, those are not all comparable deals.
[02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:25.740]   Those are different people, different properties and so on.
[02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:28.900]   But I believe as part of the deal with call her daddy,
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:33.860]   that Spotify has a first look or write a first
[02:31:33.860 --> 02:31:38.020]   refusal or automatic ownership of future properties and
[02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:43.060]   creations, not just current Joe Rogan has a licensing deal,
[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:48.500]   which is very different from an IP purchase agreement.
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:53.020]   But this is all to say that if I had,
[02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:56.820]   let's just say, who knows the four hour podcast,
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:01.060]   if I'd called it the four hour podcast and I owned that trademark
[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:06.900]   and slowly brought in other hosts or co-hosts
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:07.740]   to help,
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:12.980]   one could foresee an option of building that up into a property
[02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:17.780]   with many different personalities and selling that property.
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:20.780]   After which I,
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:25.780]   as the initial builder of that brand could be free and clear to go on and
[02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:26.620]   do other things.
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:31.820]   It is not possible to do that simply with a podcast called the Tim Ferriss
[02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:35.540]   show. Yes. So there are drawbacks, but net, net,
[02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:37.140]   that's the story of how I got there.
[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:39.980]   And I don't think about building a personal brand to be clear.
[02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:44.780]   You have a personal brand already. Everyone has a personal brand.
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:45.860]   Guess what your personal brand is.
[02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:50.860]   Your personal brand is what your closest friends and family and coworkers think
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:53.500]   of you. That's it. What do they associate you with, right?
[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:56.420]   If they had to pull four or five adjectives out of the air,
[02:32:56.420 --> 02:32:59.300]   how would they describe you? Whatever comes to mind,
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:03.420]   most naturally when people think about you, that is your personal brand.
[02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:05.500]   So we all already have a personal brand.
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:10.500]   If you want to create a personal facade or a stage persona,
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:14.420]   I'm not saying you Chris, but just in general, you can do that,
[02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:15.820]   but you should be very careful of that.
[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:21.140]   And I remember I was told,
[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:23.580]   and I'm paraphrasing here, but by Andrew Zimmern,
[02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:28.700]   who is an amazing television host who is very smart and very,
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:33.100]   very thoughtful. He's been on the podcast. His story is incredible. I mean,
[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:33.420]   he was,
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:38.420]   I think sleeping on a mattress under an overpass at one point as an addict and
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:42.460]   now is who he is. It's a really remarkable story,
[02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:46.780]   but when he was just getting started in television and he and I spoke when I was
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:48.460]   doing some television, not too long ago,
[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:54.020]   he had some choices to make in that first episode about who he wanted to be and
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:33:55.780]   how did he want to deliver his lines?
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:59.380]   Were they going to incorporate any particular types of sticks?
[02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:01.780]   Were they going to be funny?
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:04.620]   Were they going to make fun of certain things?
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:08.100]   Were they going to use the cheesy jokes?
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:13.580]   And he made a lot of decisions early on that ended up being critical to the
[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:18.020]   future of his career because he said, in effect,
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:20.460]   be very careful of who you are in episode one,
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:23.580]   because that's who you have to be for the rest of the time you're on television.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:25.900]   And I think that's true podcasting.
[02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:30.940]   So be really careful about what you pretend to be because you will have to
[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:34.180]   maintain that. And you may actually become whatever you pretend to be.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:39.100]   So I don't, I don't think a whole lot about personal brand.
[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:42.580]   Although I do think about what I want to stand for.
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:47.500]   And if I were really true to myself,
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:51.460]   like if I were really true to myself, what would I do? Who would I interview?
[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:54.460]   If I were just doing this for me, what would I do?
[02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:57.980]   And I always get the best results when I do that.
[02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:02.980]   When I try to predict the movement of the masses of some potential audience like
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:06.820]   this, you know,
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:10.020]   flock of birds where I'm trying to guess which direction they're going to fly.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:14.580]   It never turns out well for me, especially it's not fun.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:16.220]   And it's not particularly effective.
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:20.140]   One of the things you mentioned in that story was about these podcasts,
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:22.420]   getting these licensing deals or different things.
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:25.900]   A common thing that I know happens with podcasts,
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:29.380]   especially as they start to gain traction and has happened to me in the last
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:33.060]   couple of weeks is some podcast network will reach out and say, Hey,
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:35.700]   do you want to join our network? Do you want to be an iHeartRadio podcast?
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:39.900]   Do you want to, and usually get to keep all your IP, but they basically say,
[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:43.260]   Hey, we'll sell ads. We'll keep 50%. We'll help you grow your show.
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:45.660]   We'll do all this stuff. You don't have to do it. Think about it.
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:47.460]   We'll just give you the money we make.
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.260]   And it seems to your point about monetization,
[02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:54.260]   don't spend any time on it, spend time honing your craft,
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:55.820]   spend time making a good show.
[02:35:55.820 --> 02:36:01.140]   Is that a good way to kind of take all of that off your plate from thinking
[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:01.660]   about it?
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:06.380]   Would you encourage people to take those calls because they don't result in
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:10.940]   having to spend time selling ads though you lose upside for
[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:12.380]   whatever term that deal is?
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:17.340]   This is a worthwhile topic to explore. So clearly, or maybe it's not clear,
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:21.300]   but I do not work with a network or a partner of that type.
[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:24.180]   A lot of people do a lot of people do.
[02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:28.780]   And I think it depends a lot on what you
[02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:32.340]   are trying to accomplish.
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:35.220]   So a question everyone should ask is three years from now,
[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:39.260]   your podcast is successful. What does that mean to you? What does it look like?
[02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.140]   Exactly.
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:43.980]   What does a month in your life look like with respect to the podcast?
[02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:47.500]   It's successful. What does that mean? What does it look like?
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.220]   So it depends on that. It also depends on your competencies,
[02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:55.820]   your willingness to hire or work with
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:37:00.380]   contractors or commissioned salespeople to sell ads
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:04.980]   or sponsorships or find sponsors. If that is something that you want to do,
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:08.860]   is it worthwhile to take the calls? It's always worthwhile to take the calls.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:11.340]   Just don't promise anything. Yeah, definitely take the calls.
[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:14.260]   And the question that I would ask myself in preparation for those causes,
[02:37:14.580 --> 02:37:17.100]   how can I learn as much as possible from this call?
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:20.380]   So that if even if I never end up talking to this person again,
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:23.100]   I get a lot out of this.
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:26.340]   Can you ask about best practices of other podcasts?
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:31.340]   Can you ask about common mistakes that highly competent,
[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:35.820]   but novice or new to the game podcasters make in their experience?
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:40.180]   Can you ask them or indicate as a policy,
[02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:41.500]   when you have these types of conversations,
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:44.380]   you always ask if I couldn't work with you,
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:46.420]   who would you recommend I work with?
[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:49.300]   Can you start to get a better understanding of the ecosystem?
[02:37:49.300 --> 02:37:54.860]   Can you ask them about other players in the system?
[02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:56.460]   In other words,
[02:37:56.460 --> 02:38:02.140]   further your education and give yourself more and more of an informational
[02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:06.500]   advantage. Even if you never do a deal with these people,
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:10.780]   if you're willing to prepare in that way, come up with good questions,
[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:12.420]   absolutely take the call.
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:17.380]   If you're just going to fly off the cuff and see what happens,
[02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:19.180]   maybe it's still worth taking the call,
[02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:21.300]   although you won't get as much out of it, but yes,
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:25.620]   it's absolutely worth taking the call and listening to their value proposition.
[02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:30.020]   There are a number of different ways that you can sell ads.
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:35.300]   You can publish on a platform that inserts ads automatically.
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:39.580]   And there are platforms, I believe Spotify has this ability.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:43.940]   There are platforms that can do this. There are also hosting companies,
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:49.580]   I believe that will use dynamic ad insertion to fill ad inventory for you.
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:55.300]   Your revenue from that, your income from that,
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:57.940]   your CPM,
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:03.020]   the cost per thousand downloads that you get paid will be quite low for that.
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:03.900]   Generally speaking,
[02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:09.660]   you can work with a network and that network may have people in-house,
[02:39:09.660 --> 02:39:15.300]   but the network could be a network just like you and I back in the day could
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:18.100]   print a business card, which is like Kristin Associates.
[02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:20.420]   And in fact,
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:24.060]   all they're doing is partnering with yet another company.
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:29.700]   And then they're splitting the commission or the VIG between them.
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:33.900]   So that's another thing that you would want to ask.
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:37.700]   Although I would ask it at the end of the conversation in case it pisses them
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:40.500]   off, are these full-time employees of yours?
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.980]   Do you partner with other companies?
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:45.100]   Do you subcontract out pieces of this to get an idea of how things are
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:45.940]   architected?
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:51.260]   So you could partner with a network and if they say we will help grow your show,
[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:55.580]   I would find out exactly how they do that.
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:01.100]   Gimlet of course does a good job of this as do many of the NPR shows because
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:05.460]   they cross promote new shows on existing properties.
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:08.500]   If they're going to do that, find out what the reach is,
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:11.980]   find out if that's going to be for all geographies,
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:15.060]   or is it going to be a geo limited? Is it time limited? Blah, blah, blah, blah,
[02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:17.860]   all the specifics, right? That's probably for a second conversation.
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:21.180]   It's not that important compared to other questions you could ask.
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:22.900]   That's a network.
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:28.140]   You could work with companies who
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:32.900]   sell ads. That's it. That's all they do. They're not a network,
[02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:37.940]   but they will put sponsors in front of you and put your show in front of
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:42.780]   sponsors. And there are many, many different agencies that do this,
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:46.300]   just like ad agencies for other types of media.
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:49.460]   And the economics will look slightly different depending on who you talk to.
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:51.700]   And they will be different probably from the networks.
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:53.340]   Then there are very,
[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:58.340]   very small shops with maybe a handful of people and they handle ads for larger
[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:02.300]   shows. So I will not mention them by name,
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:05.100]   just because I don't want them to get deluged. But if you're diligent,
[02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:08.140]   you can figure it out. Joe Rogan, Dax,
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:13.260]   This American Life all work with the same small outfit who only work with a
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:17.980]   handful of premium properties and they sell ads for those outlets.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:23.900]   Then you can have a contractor or hire someone full-time as I did to handle all
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:30.780]   of your ad inventory. I am comfortable as an operator. I'm very, very, very,
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.900]   very comfortable with sales.
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:37.940]   And I'm very, very comfortable with waiting until
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:39.700]   in this case,
[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:44.260]   my podcast had enough of an audience and not just a large
[02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:46.260]   audience in terms of size,
[02:41:46.260 --> 02:41:51.260]   but a powerful audience in terms of influence such that I would be able to say
[02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:57.980]   no very easily and still have takers. Does that make sense?
[02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:02.620]   And then to set terms like no payment terms,
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:07.660]   you need to pay up front so that we can keep our process extremely,
[02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:11.860]   extremely simple. And in that case, I looked at it and I was like, okay,
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:17.020]   let's just take, I mean, you can do some back of the napkin stuff,
[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:19.580]   but it's like, all right, if I won't use Joe as an example,
[02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:21.740]   I'll let people try to figure that out on their own.
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:25.580]   But for him to do a deal of several years at a hundred million dollars,
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:28.340]   that would have to be a multiple of what he was making.
[02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:32.980]   He was making, I am sure a lot,
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:37.700]   but let's say that you get to the point where you are making a small fraction of
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:41.900]   that and you make a million dollars in total ad revenue,
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:46.860]   which assuming you don't have much staff is almost pure profit.
[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:51.020]   If you outsource your ad sales,
[02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:56.300]   I would say you should expect generally that at least
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:59.500]   30% of that is going to go away. Okay.
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:02.180]   So I'm no mathematician,
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:06.020]   but that is more than $300,000.
[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:10.300]   So then the question is for less than $300,000,
[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:16.020]   could you hire someone who is absolutely excellent to do it for
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:19.260]   you? And are, this is just as critical.
[02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:23.860]   Are you willing to have staff manage,
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:29.620]   do the calls, do the data analytics and so on everything necessary
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:33.980]   to ensure that those operations are extremely smooth?
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:38.380]   And the answer for a lot of people is no, even if you have the money,
[02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:43.980]   they would rather spend the $300,000
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:47.900]   plus in this case. Now, keep in mind, you know,
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:52.380]   if you're making 10 million a year, then now we're talking 3 million plus,
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:58.260]   uh, it can be very, very expensive, but it's worth it for a lot of people.
[02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:01.820]   For me, I decided I had enough entrepreneurial experience.
[02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:07.220]   I am comfortable enough with operations and process and management that
[02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:12.220]   I am totally happy to hire someone
[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:15.020]   full-time to handle that for me. So that is what I decided.
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:18.500]   Okay. So we've hit a lot of things. We have,
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:20.940]   here's a great question about a question,
[02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:25.580]   which is if you're interviewing someone about a topic and you realize well
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:27.660]   past the point that you've talked about something,
[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:31.340]   that there's a great follow-up, but you're now, you know,
[02:44:31.340 --> 02:44:36.100]   three turns down on a different highway, do you ask it still?
[02:44:36.100 --> 02:44:40.620]   And if you do, do you try to edit it back? So it fits,
[02:44:40.660 --> 02:44:43.860]   or do you just save it for next time? I've done all of the above.
[02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:47.260]   So if we're down this road and there's something I really want to ask,
[02:44:47.260 --> 02:44:50.500]   you have many, many options for me.
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.700]   One option would be you write down on a piece of paper.
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:54.820]   This is why I like to have notes.
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:58.700]   I take a lot of notes as I'm writing on things that I want to come back to also,
[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:01.740]   or things that I want to ensure I don't forget. So I'll take that.
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:05.620]   I'll circle it on a piece of paper and I'll say, if you don't mind,
[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:07.060]   I want to interrupt for just a second.
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:11.260]   This is going to be a complete left turn. And for all my listeners, sorry,
[02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:15.380]   that's just how my mind works. I really want to just put a bookmark in this.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:17.940]   So please remember where you are. I'm going to write it down.
[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:22.980]   I want to ask you about X, and then we're going to come back to Y and Z.
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:24.220]   And so you can do that.
[02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:29.940]   You could take a note of it and then use a teaser at the end of the episode and
[02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:34.100]   say, we could easily keep talking for many hours.
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:35.820]   We might have to do a round two,
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:40.700]   if you'd be open to it and simply circle that in highlighter R2 like I
[02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:44.220]   do. I mean, there are different ways to approach this and save it for next time.
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:49.580]   You could try to edit and splice somewhere else and kind of Franken
[02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:54.140]   clip your way into some type of narrative that tends to be,
[02:45:54.140 --> 02:45:57.620]   or can be very clumsy and labor intensive.
[02:45:57.620 --> 02:45:59.500]   So I tend not to do that.
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:03.540]   Well, then I'll just throw it out here. Cause it's a, it's about a guest.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:05.780]   One of the things I found,
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:09.940]   I heard you say that you got a lot of guests by asking people, Hey,
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:13.460]   you were a guest. Are there other interesting people I should have on this show?
[02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:16.620]   In recruiting, I've learned that when you go to people and say, Hey,
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:19.740]   are there interesting engineers I should hire? Everyone has nothing.
[02:46:19.740 --> 02:46:22.900]   They have to use that search function. But if you go look at their LinkedIn and
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:25.300]   say, Hey, here are four people that you know,
[02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:28.460]   that I think could be good for this job. If you think any of them are,
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.380]   would you introduce me to them? That works well.
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:35.380]   Is there a tactic you've used to find guests from your
[02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:39.980]   network of either friends or guests that helps them kind of jog the memory
[02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:41.860]   to find the people that might be interesting?
[02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:48.020]   No, it's a short answer. I don't have any particular tricks here.
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:52.420]   I will mention to people, I'll say, you know,
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:55.380]   I really enjoyed speaking with you. You're excellent at what you do.
[02:46:55.380 --> 02:46:58.260]   And this was outstanding.
[02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:03.340]   If you ever think of anybody who you think would really enjoy being on the show,
[02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:06.180]   who I would also really enjoy speaking to, please let me know.
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:09.260]   And I just leave it at that. I would say at this point,
[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:13.820]   probably 80% plus of my guests come as referrals from past guests.
[02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:18.780]   And it will become easier and easier over time.
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:22.460]   When you have 15 episodes, it's harder. It's just a smaller sample size.
[02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:25.100]   When you have 30, 50, there is a,
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:29.820]   there's a non-linear kind of growth in the
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:34.580]   connectivity of the map that you're creating this constellation of guests and
[02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:38.300]   the types of people they can reach. So it gets,
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:43.420]   I would say exponentially easier over time to get referrals.
[02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:47.140]   And I will also say just as a side note,
[02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:52.820]   a question that you can ask to also improve
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:57.900]   your interviewing and podcasting is one that
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:00.940]   Adam Grant asked me when he was a guest on the podcast,
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:05.220]   after we stopped recording and you need to be insistent,
[02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:08.740]   but he said, or he asked rather,
[02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:10.620]   what can I do to improve?
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:16.580]   And I gave him some throwaway answer because it's an uncomfortable question.
[02:48:16.580 --> 02:48:21.420]   So I said something like, it was great. It was really fantastic. And it was,
[02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:25.100]   he was really, really, really good. And I'm pretty sure he responded with,
[02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:29.820]   I appreciate that. I appreciate the kind feedback,
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:33.900]   and I'm not going to let you go until you give me one thing, just one thing,
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:38.260]   anything could be small that I could do to improve as a guest.
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:43.300]   And I think he had a habit of, I don't want to say nervous,
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:47.540]   but laughing a lot after certain questions or answers.
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:52.300]   And I said, that might be something that you could take a look at if it was one
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:54.660]   thing. And I had to pick one thing you're outstanding.
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:58.740]   It was absolutely wonderful as is, but if I had to pick one thing,
[02:48:58.740 --> 02:49:01.460]   that would probably be it. And he was like, awesome. Great. Thank you so much.
[02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:04.700]   And he was stoked. Yeah.
[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:08.900]   If you want to get that type of feedback, you have to be insistent,
[02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:10.540]   I think because it's uncomfortable.
[02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:13.820]   You're putting someone in an uncomfortable position right after you've done this
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:15.740]   thing. You're feeling good,
[02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:20.340]   probably to deliver news that you might not like. And so you have to just say,
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:23.340]   look, I love this stuff. I'm not going to let you go.
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:26.580]   Just give you one thing could be anything, tiny thing,
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:30.540]   something that I could do to improve and that gets results.
[02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:35.980]   And that is my dog barking because I have a delivery coming to the
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:36.780]   door.
[02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:40.780]   So I think we should probably wrap up in a few minutes since we're almost at
[02:49:40.900 --> 02:49:45.180]   three hours, but I know you have prepared more.
[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:49.220]   And so who knows, maybe there is a round two in our future,
[02:49:49.220 --> 02:49:53.580]   but what other boxes do you think we should check?
[02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:56.540]   I have a good kind of wrap up question,
[02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:01.380]   at least is you launched your show and you said you'd commit to six episodes.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:04.380]   And I've seen you say you'd reassess then.
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:07.980]   And then after deciding to continue, I saw you say you'd reassess again at a
[02:50:07.980 --> 02:50:12.420]   hundred. What kind of a process do you go through when you reassess?
[02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:14.580]   Is it just a gut? Do I want to keep going?
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:18.340]   Or was there more going on each time you hit that milestone?
[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:19.900]   It's a pretty simple check-in.
[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:24.740]   I think most things can be boiled down to how do you feel when you first wake up
[02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:27.140]   and how easily do you go to sleep?
[02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:31.420]   Like how do different decisions affect that? Certainly true.
[02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:34.300]   And investing big time, like you could have on paper,
[02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:35.620]   the best investment of all time.
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:38.100]   But if you're waking up anxious and having trouble going to sleep,
[02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:40.100]   it's probably not a good investment for you.
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:42.900]   And this is true for podcasting too.
[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:47.020]   How do you feel when you look at your calendar and you see that you have a
[02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:51.500]   podcast at 10 AM or 2 PM or whenever it is, what happens internally?
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:55.500]   Is it a whole body? Yes. I mean, how do you feel mentally?
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.940]   How do you feel kind of in your chest?
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:51:01.340]   How do you feel in your gut and really paying attention to that?
[02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:06.340]   It's a full body check-in for me. Imagine,
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:08.460]   okay, it's Tuesday,
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:13.300]   you're tired and all you want to do is call it
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:14.060]   quits.
[02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:18.340]   But you realize you've got 90 to 120 minutes ahead of you for a podcast.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:23.260]   How do you feel? What do you do? What is your self-talk? What does it look like?
[02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:24.660]   What has it been?
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:28.860]   Those are the types of questions that I ask myself.
[02:51:29.460 --> 02:51:33.940]   And I want podcasting to be something that
[02:51:33.940 --> 02:51:37.740]   nourishes me and refills me, not something that depletes me.
[02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:41.660]   And I think many, if not,
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:46.340]   most of my decisions these days with respect to
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:48.900]   just about anything are framed in that way.
[02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:53.620]   And it's simple,
[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:58.340]   but the implications are pretty far reaching. It has nothing to do with revenue.
[02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:02.260]   That's nothing to do with how big the names are. It's really,
[02:52:02.260 --> 02:52:04.580]   how do I feel when I see it on the calendar?
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:10.020]   How do I feel when I'm recording? How do I feel when it comes out?
[02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:14.380]   Is it net positive energy or net negative energy?
[02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:18.700]   And if it's net positive and keep feeding the dragon,
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:24.620]   that's how I feel. And also you can build in the ability to take breaks.
[02:52:24.660 --> 02:52:29.100]   So for instance, to touch on one thing that I dropped a long time ago,
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:31.860]   which was recording cadence. And by the way,
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:33.740]   your brain is really incredibly trainable.
[02:52:33.740 --> 02:52:36.420]   You get better at doing this as you record more and more podcasts,
[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:40.420]   just like mentally bookmarking things to come back to recording cadence.
[02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:45.100]   So I will very often once per quarter do a content creation
[02:52:45.100 --> 02:52:45.940]   week,
[02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:50.700]   which includes all of any social needs and all of my
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:52.780]   podcast needs for the next three months.
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:57.940]   And I will record all of them in perhaps one
[02:52:57.940 --> 02:52:59.100]   week, Monday to Friday,
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:03.420]   or I may tag on an extra Monday, Tuesday and the following week.
[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:06.540]   And I will record all, which for me means 12,
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:11.380]   say episodes for the next three months.
[02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:14.820]   And then if I want to do more episodes, if I feel compelled,
[02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:17.820]   if there are things that pop up like this episode, for instance,
[02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:21.740]   I don't need to record this episode. We're recording this early September.
[02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:25.740]   I have all of my episodes until probably December covered already.
[02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:29.780]   They're done. I don't have to do a thing. I can sit back and chill,
[02:53:29.780 --> 02:53:33.580]   but I wanted to record this episode because I get so many questions about
[02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:35.700]   podcasts. And I also wanted to answer your questions.
[02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:39.700]   So you can batch recording in that way.
[02:53:39.700 --> 02:53:45.140]   I batch any sponsor recording in a similar way so that I'm
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:50.460]   not doing by the way, like refreshes people who want a live read every time,
[02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:54.540]   not going to do it. If you have an ad that is working,
[02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:59.220]   do you keep using it until it stops working in terms of your sort
[02:53:59.220 --> 02:54:03.860]   of return on invested capital, right? Your multiple, whatever it might be.
[02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:06.980]   And their answer is, Oh, we keep using. I'm like, that's exactly what we do.
[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:10.700]   So once we have a good read, we keep using it. And for that reason,
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:13.460]   I'll batch recording for sponsors in a similar way.
[02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:18.980]   And any review of guests with one person on my team,
[02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:23.700]   we will know more than once a week for a very short period of time,
[02:54:23.700 --> 02:54:28.540]   maybe five or 10 minutes review potential guests who have come in typically
[02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:32.580]   from past guests and decide how I feel about them.
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:34.780]   It doesn't matter how interesting they are, how good they are,
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:39.580]   what they do at the end of the day, like zero to 10, no seven allowed.
[02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:42.980]   What's my stoke level. If it's not an eight, nine or 10,
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:45.300]   we do not press go.
[02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:50.620]   And that is also some of how I
[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:55.380]   systematize the production and the editing and so on such
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:55:00.260]   that the tasks and the responsibilities of the podcast are not
[02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:06.260]   scattered kind of willy nilly all over my calendar,
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:11.300]   which is very would be, I think stressful and ultimately a net negative
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:16.420]   energetically. So batching also helps to make things much more fun,
[02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:21.020]   much easier, much more streamlined and much less expensive.
[02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:25.980]   And ultimately coming back to the very beginning, much more sustainable.
[02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:30.900]   And for all of those reasons and more,
[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:35.300]   I don't have a set time to check in with myself about the podcast.
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:40.780]   I batch and I expect if you check in with me five
[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:42.780]   years from now, unless something really strange has happened,
[02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:44.180]   I'll probably still be doing the podcast.
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:48.380]   But was the batching always there or, you know,
[02:55:48.380 --> 02:55:50.860]   you only committed to six episodes at the gate.
[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:52.860]   That means in episode seven,
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:56.900]   you needed to find in those first six episodes of production.
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:56:01.140]   How long did it take to get to that batching versus just in time?
[02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:04.820]   Like I need to go set up an interview so that I can release an episode next
[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:05.500]   week.
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:07.700]   Well, the batching is as needed.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:12.340]   So they're batching has some practical utility in the sense that you finish
[02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:15.580]   everything in one week as necessary for the next two to three months.
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:20.580]   But I also get energized by the podcast. So I will sometimes decide,
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:23.740]   you know what, I'm not going to batch all of my recording,
[02:56:23.740 --> 02:56:28.100]   but I'm going to do one recording per week or every other week because I find
[02:56:28.100 --> 02:56:32.940]   that it refills my tank. So it's not a burden to be lightened.
[02:56:32.940 --> 02:56:36.820]   It is also something that gives me more fuel for everything else that I'm doing.
[02:56:37.180 --> 02:56:40.820]   Therefore, I'm not going to record everything in the batching session,
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:45.980]   but I will record enough so that I don't feel like I have a gun against my head
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:47.140]   and oh shit,
[02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:51.740]   it's Tuesday and I need to put out an episode on Thursday. Fuck.
[02:56:51.740 --> 02:56:53.780]   Now I need to rejig my whole schedule.
[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:55.860]   That's not an experience I want to have.
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:57.700]   And it's one that I can very easily avoid.
[02:56:57.700 --> 02:57:02.380]   So the batching and the systematizing comes in my experience later,
[02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:05.900]   you got to throw a lot against the wall and figure out what works and what works
[02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:10.340]   for you. And then you can establish policies and rules so that you're making very
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:15.220]   few decisions instead of a death by a million
[02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:16.060]   paper cuts.
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:21.020]   And I do think that striving for
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:26.620]   what excites you and striving for what nourishes you goes a really long
[02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:29.500]   way. And to come back to a couple of recommendations,
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:33.860]   the 22 immutable laws of marketing, the law of category, read that chapter,
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:37.780]   even if the examples are outdated, read it, get the older copy,
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:39.380]   not the for the internet.
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:43.660]   Cause I think the for the internet was written like 98 or 99 and the examples are
[02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:48.300]   really funny, but get the older version positioning by the same authors,
[02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:53.940]   Reese, R I E S not Eric, but an older Reese and trout,
[02:57:53.940 --> 02:57:59.060]   I believe are the names as well as 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly at
[02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:01.020]   KK.org. Kevin Kelly, honestly,
[02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:04.660]   maybe the real life most interesting man in the world.
[02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:05.740]   And if you want proof of that,
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:08.300]   you can listen to my first podcast episode with him.
[02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:11.580]   Stewart brand might be a also a close contender.
[02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:14.940]   I think Kevin would probably say Stewart brand is the one who wins that title,
[02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:18.700]   but it's a fun game. I encourage everyone to try it.
[02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:21.380]   You'll learn a lot about yourself at the very least.
[02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:25.820]   So I definitely have. And with that, my friend,
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:29.260]   I think we can bring this to a close.
[02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:31.180]   We will link to everything in the show notes,
[02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:34.660]   all of these various things we've talked about, including the article,
[02:58:34.660 --> 02:58:39.340]   the very, very extensive article I wrote in 2016 and the link to the podcast
[02:58:39.340 --> 02:58:43.540]   with Rolf Potts. We'll link to all of those things and more in the show notes,
[02:58:43.540 --> 02:58:46.980]   but I don't want to omit one very important thing.
[02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:50.860]   And that is to mention Chris's podcast.
[02:58:50.860 --> 02:58:54.820]   And we didn't get to go into lessons from different guests,
[02:58:54.820 --> 02:58:57.660]   which I asked you to prepare. So maybe another time we'll do that,
[02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:01.300]   but I've listened to a couple of episodes, really enjoyed the,
[02:59:01.300 --> 02:59:06.060]   I listened to your first and your last. So at least on Overcast,
[02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:10.260]   I listened to the first episode, which was with Lee Rowan,
[02:59:10.260 --> 02:59:12.540]   which was outstanding, really enjoyed it.
[02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:17.260]   Even though I'm not hugely obsessed with points and optimizing
[02:59:17.260 --> 02:59:19.860]   on that side, there were a lot of really good points.
[02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:22.020]   So I'm going to go refer to the show notes on that.
[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:26.700]   And I listened to Andy Radcliffe, who's incredible.
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:29.780]   One of the co-founders of Benchmark Capital also,
[02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:33.580]   which is one of the most successful venture capital firms of all time.
[02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:36.380]   I think their initial fund, I learned this from the podcast,
[02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:40.700]   had what 92 X returns. It's just bananas. And that's,
[02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:42.900]   that's an episode on investing as you might imagine.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:47.820]   And I'm listening currently to episode six on the psychology of money
[02:59:47.820 --> 02:59:52.700]   with Morgan Household and enjoying that quite a lot. So the podcast is good.
[02:59:52.700 --> 02:59:56.340]   It's super solid. And I think you're off to the races, man.
[02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:59.580]   I don't have tons of critical feedback for you.
[02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:02.980]   I think you're doing a good job and it's really about keeping it interesting for
[03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:04.060]   you and staying the course.
[03:00:04.060 --> 03:00:08.300]   But what else would you like to say about your podcast and where people can find
[03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:08.940]   it?
[03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:11.580]   I would just say, give it a listen and wherever you listen podcasts,
[03:00:11.580 --> 03:00:12.780]   which you're obviously doing right now.
[03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:17.060]   So just search for All The Hacks and reach out if you have feedback and there's
[03:00:17.060 --> 03:00:18.460]   topics you want me to explore.
[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:22.700]   AllTheHacks.com. Is that right? Yep. AllTheHacks.com.
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:27.020]   AllTheHacks.com. And this man knows of what he speaks.
[03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:31.460]   Chris is optimizer Supreme. And I don't say that lightly. It's,
[03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:36.100]   it's kind of mind boggling to me how methodical you are with optimizing so many
[03:00:36.100 --> 03:00:36.900]   areas of your life.
[03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:41.860]   So this is a person who walks the walk and I've
[03:00:41.860 --> 03:00:46.220]   seen it firsthand in many, many areas.
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:48.700]   So I encourage people to check it out. AllTheHacks.com.
[03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:53.220]   We'll link to it in the show notes and it is good to spend time with you,
[03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:57.420]   Christopher. Yeah. Thank you for, thank you for co-hosting slash hosting this
[03:00:57.420 --> 03:00:58.100]   episode.
[03:00:58.100 --> 03:01:00.980]   Yeah. I can now, I guess I can put on my resume host of the Tim Ferriss show.
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:03.260]   You said it had to be you, but here we go.
[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:09.580]   Tim Tim, Chris, Chris, volume two. Thanks for tuning in everybody.
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:14.180]   All right. If you're still here,
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:18.100]   thank you so much for joining this really unique episode of All The Hacks.
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:21.780]   I know I learned a ton from Tim and I'm already putting those learnings to good
[03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:25.100]   use to find some amazing guests to bring on All The Hacks.
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:28.340]   I'll keep this outro short because this show was long.
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:31.420]   So if you haven't left a rating and review in the Apple podcast app,
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:34.460]   it would mean so much to me if you could. And if you want to get in touch,
[03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:37.780]   I'm Chris@AllTheHacks.com and @Hutchins on Twitter.
[03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:42.220]   Thank you so much and see you next week for a conversation about travel points
[03:01:42.220 --> 03:01:45.540]   and miles with the points guy himself, Brian Kelly.
[03:01:51.460 --> 03:01:53.180]   I want to tell you about another podcast.
[03:01:53.180 --> 03:01:55.660]   I love that goes deep on all things money.
[03:01:55.660 --> 03:01:59.420]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:01.820]   It's called the personal finance podcast,
[03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:05.980]   and it's much more about building generational wealth and spending your money on
[03:02:05.980 --> 03:02:09.540]   the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[03:02:09.540 --> 03:02:11.420]   It's hosted by my good friend,
[03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:15.380]   Andrew who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth and his
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:18.860]   passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[03:02:19.220 --> 03:02:22.780]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:27.500]   but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that
[03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:28.500]   will blow your mind.
[03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:33.460]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:35.100]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:38.740]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:41.700]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[03:02:41.700 --> 03:02:45.460]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[03:02:45.460 --> 03:02:49.100]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:53.300]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on apple podcasts, Spotify,
[03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:55.940]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
