[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.520]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.560]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.520]   Now, this episode is a bit different than most, and not just
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040]   because it's three hours long.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   Why?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.720]   Well, along my journey to build and grow this podcast, I had a chance to sit down
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.520]   and interview my friend, Tim Ferriss, about everything he's learned growing
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   his podcast to over 700 million downloads.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.720]   Now, I assume most of you don't have or even want to have a podcast, but I've
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.120]   already gotten so much feedback from non-podcasters that found this episode
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.960]   interesting and valuable to their life and their work, and I think that's because
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.680]   we talk about interviewing skills, marketing, branding, storytelling, and so
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.320]   much more.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   You'll also get a deep inside look at how podcasts, specifically All The Hacks, got
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   started, how everything comes together each week from the equipment, the
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.360]   production, the interviews, and everything else.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.440]   And if that's not interesting, you're welcome to skip this one, but you'll
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.280]   definitely want to come back next week for a conversation with the points guy
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.520]   himself, Brian Kelly, all about travel and credit card hacks.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560]   Also, this episode is the same one released on The Tim Ferriss Show a few
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   weeks ago, so you may have already heard it there, and because we originally
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   recorded the intros for Tim's show, it definitely won't start off like a
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.120]   regular episode of All The Hacks.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.560]   All that said, I really hope you enjoy it.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.160]   And as always, you can get in touch at chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.440]   Let's do this.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.920]   This is Tim Ferriss, and welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.560]   We have had three technical failures, but we've made it happen.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.840]   And this is an improv episode.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.000]   I'm very excited about it, because my friend Chris reached out with many
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.800]   questions about podcasting, good questions.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.640]   He had already read much of what I had written.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   He'd listened to several interviews, and this is intended to be an updated
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.120]   guide to all things podcasting.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   The last time I wrote anything at length about this, I think the Tim Ferriss Show
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.040]   had about 60 or 65 million total downloads.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.760]   Now it's past 700 million.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   So the show has grown.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.800]   A lot has happened.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.360]   Technologies have, I want to say, developed, not always evolved, as we
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.920]   may end up covering.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360]   But Chris, why don't you take a moment to tell people who you are?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.800]   We've known each other now for at least six years, maybe closer to 10.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.720]   I can't really even recall how we first met, but we have a mutual friend in
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.360]   Kevin Rose and many other people.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.960]   Who are you, Chris?
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   So hi, everybody.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.560]   I'm a bit of one of those crazy life hacker optimizers, take it to the extreme
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.160]   sometimes. And I host a podcast, hopefully a soon-to-be award-winning
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.200]   podcast, called All The Hacks, where I document my journey to upgrade my life,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.600]   money, travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.880]   Outside of that, I'm building new products at Wealthfront.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.400]   And before all of this, I've started a few companies, sold a few companies,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.120]   worked in venture capital, investment banking, management consulting, and kind
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.600]   of traveled around the world for eight months.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.760]   So a bit of a seasoned set of random things, jack of all trades, maybe master
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.080]   of none. And I'm excited to be here.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.280]   Well, I am excited to jam because I actually haven't spoken at length in
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.760]   detail about the latest and greatest or in some cases, the old and the tried
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   and the true that I don't think needs to change.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.840]   But I want to underscore that you really do know what you're doing when it
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.960]   comes to certain obsessive deep dives that you've done, particularly, I
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.480]   shouldn't say particularly, but including travel and points and not just
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.320]   saving or cutting costs, but improving the immersive experiences that you have
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.600]   in life. And so you've traveled to roughly 70 countries, mostly for free on
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.720]   points, and there's much more to it.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.880]   How many episodes have you recorded and published so far of your podcast?
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.160]   Just so people have some context.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.480]   This is relatively new.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.720]   I think I just released episode 19 when we're recording this.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.360]   So it's been, I started in May, it's September.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.720]   So only, you know, four or five months.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.960]   We'll come at this from many different angles, but where do you think it makes
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.600]   sense to start in preparation for this, hoping this would be sort of the one
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.680]   stop shopping or at least the jumping off point for anyone who really wants to
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.160]   study, maybe not best practices, but good practices within podcasting?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.000]   Where do you think it makes sense to start?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.400]   So there were two things that you've done that I think really gave me a lot of
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.480]   background. And one was the post you mentioned that you wrote in 2016.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.320]   And then you did a maybe two hour or something interview with Rolf Potts on his
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.520]   Deviate podcast and talked a lot about this.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.800]   So I thought maybe to kick it off, I'll just highlight some of my takeaways from
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.880]   doing my homework and, you know, feel free to say, whoa, that's wrong.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   That's changed. But we can kind of run through what I learned and then we can kind
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.240]   of run through that same series of kind of getting started, picking gear, finding
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.760]   guests again and kind of dive deeper on what's changed and how it's evolved and
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   questions that maybe were left unanswered in the original stuff.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.280]   Let's do it. Perfect.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.840]   So when it comes to getting started, this is something that I, like you, took a
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.760]   while to decide to start a podcast.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.080]   And one of the pieces of advice that you gave that was really valuable to me was
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.680]   you don't have to commit forever.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.920]   I think it always feels like a thing that you have to do forever.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.280]   Once you start it happens every week forever and you can kind of set a date and
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.120]   say, let's do five, let's do 10 episodes and that's it.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   And we'll reevaluate. So I think that's a really important takeaway is that knowing
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   you don't have to commit forever.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.200]   And the other big one is it's a lot more work than it seems.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   And so you said only do this if you do it for free, which really means like it's
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.200]   got to be you. It's got to be what format excites you, the tone of voice, the kinds
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.280]   of guests, the questions that are exciting to you.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.920]   Otherwise, you'll get bored.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.480]   And the final kind of getting started advice I took away was, look, if you don't
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.760]   have an audience, don't be afraid.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.360]   Everyone started with some lack of audience at some point.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.200]   And plenty of people with massive audiences have totally failed in podcasting.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.440]   So the quick way is just get a couple episodes out there, keep it simple, do
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.920]   something you love. Don't worry about the business side and experiment.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   And I think that kind of sums up what everyone needs to know in a very concise way
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.960]   before getting started.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   Let me add to that.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.720]   So I agree with all of that.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.280]   And I want to add a couple of nuances or just additional comments.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:12.640]   So it's helpful to bracket the minimum and then a check-in point for your
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   commitment to podcasting.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.840]   In other words, you could say, I'm only committing to do it to X or for Y number
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.800]   of episodes. I decided to do six episodes, to commit to six episodes in the
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   beginning because I wanted to ensure that I could win even if I failed.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   What that meant was, what skills can I develop, learn or improve?
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:43.360]   What relationships can I forge or deepen that will be of value to me even if I
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.640]   stop podcasting?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.120]   So the minimum effective dose for that is probably not one episode.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.720]   It's probably not two episodes, probably not three episodes.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.000]   For me, I thought, "Eh, it's probably somewhere between five and ten.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Let's just commit to doing six."
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.680]   I don't know exactly why I chose six.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.560]   And the way I could win even if I failed in that case was by improving my ability
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.680]   to ask questions and plan interviews because I was already doing that in the
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.240]   course of writing books, when I did research, when I found experts.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.600]   These were all transferable skills.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   And then I would also have an excuse to deepen relationships with some of my
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.320]   close friends because it's pretty creepy to do hours and hours of internet
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   sleuthing on your friends otherwise.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.160]   But if you have the pretext of an interview, you can actually learn a lot
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.320]   about people like Kevin Rose, our mutual friend who was my first guest ever, who
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.640]   shaved my nuts really hard.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.960]   And it's pretty funny to listen to now.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   It was less amusing at the time.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.640]   So that's, I think, an aspect of the picking of the minimum dose that's
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.040]   important.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.400]   Doing something you love is ideal.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.040]   If you can do something you love, fantastic.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   If you don't know what it is that you love or would love, because if it's a new
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.520]   medium, you may have no idea, at least do something that is sustainable.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.880]   Don't do something for, say, six episodes that you can't do for 500 episodes.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.840]   That's my advice.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.960]   And if you try to out this American life, this American life, you're going to get
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.840]   your face ripped off.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.920]   There's a reason when they read the credits at the end that they have staff of
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.360]   like 20 or 30 people.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:27.280]   It is an incredible amount of work and they work very hard for it to seem
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.360]   seamless and maybe even improvised.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.880]   Wow, it's so conversational.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.680]   They do this with the team at Gimlet as well.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.640]   You listen to like, oh, they're just having a conversation.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   Like, no, believe me.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   They're not just having a conversation.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.680]   So sustainability is super important.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.800]   And like you said, Chris, there's more involved than you expect.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.320]   And you should ask yourself, this applies to podcasting.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.640]   It applies to many other things.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.680]   If this cost twice as much, took twice as much time, would I still do it?
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.280]   And if the answer is no, either don't do it or change the format, change the
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.440]   approach so that the answer is yes.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.720]   And podcasting is not the native element for all people.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.840]   So if you think about how people with large audiences have built large
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.240]   audiences, in some cases, they build them on YouTube and then that audience
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.880]   follows them to new formats.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.520]   In some cases, mine would be such a case.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.480]   They build it through books, but books don't give you direct access to readers
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.600]   in the same way that podcasts do not give you direct access to your listeners.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.440]   So I ported the popularity of the books into building a popular blog.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.520]   The blog is what gave me an audience that then traveled in part, at least to
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   podcasting.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.480]   So a lot of building a large audience, if that is one of your goals, and by the
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.280]   way, I don't think that is a worthwhile goal in and of itself.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.000]   I would ask why, why, why, why, at least a few times, or so what, at the very
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.320]   least, then you need to choose a game you can win, and that requires some
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.280]   self-assessment.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.000]   But for instance, if you decide you should do podcasting because everyone else is
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   doing podcasting, you are going to be outlasted, outsmarted, outmaneuvered by
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.440]   people who are really, really enthusiastic about the medium, about the
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.920]   format.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.400]   They're just going to be better and they're going to last longer.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.360]   There's this gigantic kind of elephant graveyard of three episode podcasts.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.720]   So if you're likely to be a casualty, do something else, pick a different medium.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:49.360]   And because I mentioned it, I think at the very head of the show, if I didn't, I
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.280]   should have, we had a number of technical difficulties in getting this show
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.680]   started.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.120]   We had a number of false starts.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   We began, sorry to throw you guys under the bus, but you kind of failed us today.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.840]   Zencastr had a number of issues.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.040]   Then the plan was to jump to Squadcast, but you have used Riverside.fm.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.240]   All of these platforms I have seen fail.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.080]   None of them are perfect.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.480]   And therefore, on the technical side, whether you are in-person or remote, the
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.640]   expression that I first learned from friends in the military, two is one and
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.400]   one is none.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.680]   If you have a single point of failure, you are going to be fucked.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.920]   At some point you will have a disaster and it will be a mess.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.880]   Always have backup options.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.720]   So in the calendar invite or in the email that was sent to Chris and also in my
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.000]   calendar, there are at least two backup options and both of us are currently
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.200]   recording local backup audio using QuickTime audio.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.840]   So those are a few things that I wanted to add.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.680]   Please continue, Chris.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.960]   So I do want to talk about gear, but I'll ask one question before, which is in
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.600]   2017, you said, "Yeah, it's definitely not too late to start a podcast." But, you
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.280]   know, that was a long time ago.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.360]   24% of people had listened to a podcast.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.800]   Now it's closer to 60.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.680]   There were a few hundred thousand podcasts.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.960]   Now there's over 2 million.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.120]   You still think we're early in the days of podcasting and there's lots of
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.280]   opportunity or is it too crowded and people should consider new mediums for
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.680]   content?
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.200]   I think it's still super early.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.560]   I think it's still super, super early.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.040]   There are some indicators or maybe proxies that you can use for that.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.000]   The percentage of, say, terrestrial radio or satellite radio advertising
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   dollars that have migrated to podcasting is still extremely low.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   I don't know what the percentage is, but it's very low.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.480]   I would anticipate just based on the types of brands that you see
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.600]   represented and you can look at other types of media.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.800]   So based on that alone, I think we are very much in the early days, super,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.920]   super early days.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:08.040]   And that said, we've seen a lot of changes over the last handful of years.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.720]   If you look at the charts, say on Apple or elsewhere, if you look at Apple,
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   the one person shops or small team shops like mine are fewer and fewer and far
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.960]   between where, let's just say when I got started in whenever it was 2014, I
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.720]   think maybe a little bit earlier, you had Joe Rogan way up at the top.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:42.440]   Of course, you had Nerdist, you had Mark Maron, you had a handful of others who
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.240]   were constantly in the top 10, top 20 on what was then iTunes.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.000]   What you see now is professional outfits.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   You see companies, you see organizations, WNYC, you see Pushkin, which I think
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.600]   does a really nice job.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.680]   You see actual companies.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.120]   You see also incumbents, previous sort of terrestrial incumbents who are now
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.840]   investing dollars in the podcasting.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:19.200]   So there has never been more competition, but the analogy I might use is let's
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.640]   use startup investing, something that you and I are quite familiar with.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   So I had the very good luck of starting to do angel investing in 2008.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   Now this was perfect timing because there was a financial crisis, which
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:44.560]   meant all the fair weather entrepreneurs, founders, and investors kind of ran for
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:52.280]   the hills and that left the diehards and the true believers, which meant that the
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.520]   playing field was very uncrowded and you could actually find really, really good
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.880]   startups, I believed, all over the place.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.200]   In 2008, 2009, it was a great time to invest.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.600]   In 2000, say 15 or so, I decided to exit stage left, not because there
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.560]   weren't great companies.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.120]   There were great companies, but it was a lot harder.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.720]   The deal terms were harder.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.320]   There was a huge influx of capital from all over the place, including China.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.400]   Things were getting really weird for me.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.480]   And I realized, okay, this just went from single deck blackjack, where you could
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.240]   have a system as a solo player, as a team, to multiple deck blackjack.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.400]   And I don't have confidence using my own bankroll that I can win in this
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.200]   environment, so I took a long break.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.480]   Similarly, you just have to be better now.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.560]   When I started in 2014, and if you had an existing audience that would travel with
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:57.680]   you, you could be in the top 20, 30, 40, 50 on then iTunes, now Apple with relative
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.920]   ease, and you can still do that if you have a massive influx of subscribers over
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.880]   a short period of time.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.120]   It could be a few days, could be a week, but you'll fall off.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.440]   It's simply harder now, so there's all the more reason why you should have
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:18.120]   confidence that you're going to do this with some degree of dedication to the
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.960]   craft, like you, Chris.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   You're taking the study of the craft and the practice and the deliberate training,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.720]   so to speak, very seriously, and you have to have, I think, good reasons for doing
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.200]   it, and a good reason could be, "I enjoy doing it."
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.600]   Great, that's a good enough reason.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.560]   You do not need to be on the charts to have a "successful podcast," but you have
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.880]   to ask yourself, "Why am I starting a podcast?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.040]   Why do I want to start a podcast?"
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.120]   So let me ask you that, Chris.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.640]   Why did you want to start a podcast?
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.400]   Why did you decide to start a podcast?
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.680]   I think two things happened at the same time.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.720]   So one was, I found myself constantly, whether I was with a group of people I
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.840]   knew or didn't know, telling a story about a level of optimization in the
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.480]   financial travel world that most people hadn't thought about.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.920]   And I thought, "Man, I love telling that story to people.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.080]   Could I tell that story at more scale because it seems like it's happening a
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.000]   person at a time?"
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.760]   That was a piece of it.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.200]   And then the bigger piece was, I loved that game.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.760]   And I knew that the only way I would get better at that game and go deeper at that
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.080]   game was to learn.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.120]   And there are people out there that know much more about different types of ways to
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.920]   upgrade life, ways to optimize, ways to make more money or save more money or invest
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.280]   better. I was going to find those people and have those conversations anyway because I
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.560]   was. But I knew that people loved hearing those stories in small groups.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.520]   And I thought if I had a platform where I could have those conversations and share
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.320]   them, people just like I would see at a dinner table would enjoy listening to them on
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   a run, at home, driving in the car.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.720]   And so I thought, "I'm going to do this anyways.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.760]   I love doing it.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.000]   Why not see if other people really do want to listen at scale?"
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.720]   And they did.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.920]   Do you still feel like that is enough, the psychic gratification of sharing what you
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.120]   would have done otherwise?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.160]   Because the reality is, it is kind of what you would have done otherwise.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   But the setup and the tech and the microphones and the post-production and everything
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   else involved adds a layer of labor and complexity.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.560]   So what on top of that, if anything, there doesn't need to be anything extra, but how
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.480]   has your thinking changed on what makes it worthwhile to continue or not?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.200]   Well, what's interesting is, let's take an episode I did with a writer, Morgan
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.960]   Housel, and it was all about the psychology of money.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.040]   I'd read the book.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.320]   I'd been fascinated by it.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.160]   I had questions I wanted to ask Morgan.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.760]   I could probably just reach out and say, "Hey, I'm just a person, and I want to learn
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.920]   more about what you wrote.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.800]   Can we talk?"
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.520]   But I'm guessing I would have had better success, which I did, saying, "Hey, I have
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.720]   this podcast. I want to talk.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.160]   I want to ask you those questions and share that with my audience."
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.400]   And so having the podcast lets you level up, I believe, the people you can have those
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.960]   conversations with because there's a reason.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.400]   It gives a reason to do that.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.640]   And then as the audience grows, it gives a second reason.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.960]   So one is, you could just reach out and say, "Can we do a phone call?"
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.720]   But there's at least a reason.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.040]   And then as the audience grows, there's more.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.600]   And that, I think, is worth the trade-off of the amount of work you have to put into
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.840]   it. But you mentioned gear.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   There's a world where, and I believe you can buy a microphone for under $100 and use a
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.600]   pair of headphones you already own and keep it pretty simple.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.080]   And I think to your original post and what we talked about earlier, the more simple you
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.000]   make it, the easier it will be to keep going and the more authentic it will be.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.960]   Which, you know, you may think you want to say something because it's what the audience
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.200]   wants to hear. And there's this weird thing where it's actually just ask what you want.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.480]   And most people are more engaged by your engagement with a conversation than if you ask
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.280]   a question they want to hear, but you're bored having that conversation.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah, absolutely. And just to give people a sense, right now I'm using what I use more or
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.760]   less all of the time for remote recording.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:25.600]   And I remotely record even pre-COVID, probably 80-90% of my interviews.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.680]   It allows you to get better guests, by the way, generally speaking.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:37.000]   Unless you're the undisputed king of podcasts like Joe Rogan, then you can insist on in
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.360]   person visits. But very few podcasters have that leverage and you will sacrifice some
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.600]   guests by having those conditions.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.280]   So I do everything remotely.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.240]   It makes my life easier as well.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.560]   I'm in a farmhouse right now.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:55.480]   I've recorded dozens of podcasts here and I have a Logitech Brio camera, which I do not
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   use all of the time.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.520]   I very frequently do audio only.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.400]   We could talk about why I don't do more video.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   I have an Audio-Technica ATR2100X, one of the more recent.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.200]   It might be a 2500 and you have that exact microphone in front of you.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.880]   This is probably, what would you say, an $80, $80 to $100 microphone that connects to my
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:25.320]   MacBook Pro. And then I'm using AirPods for in-ear listening.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.000]   That's it. That is the sum total of hardware that I am using.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.440]   And we're currently recording on Riverside.FM, which you use.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:42.240]   I typically use Zencaster and Squadcast, but all of these things break, so have backup.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:51.280]   And if this didn't work, I also have a conference line with no pin that can be set to
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.960]   record. So if my computer broke, I could call Chris on my cell phone and we could record
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.360]   the conversation. I have backups upon backups upon backups.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.600]   And trust me, at some point, you're going to need it.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.320]   Is there a point at which you would just reschedule instead of or how do you think about
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.480]   that? The quality of a conference bridge being maybe not worth doing now and
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.720]   postponing to when your computer worked again?
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:29.520]   I will reschedule if the connection is really bad or if the audio on the opposite end is
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:38.000]   very poor. And to try to minimize the likelihood of the audio being poor on the other
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.040]   end, we ship every guest a microphone.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.720]   Unless they already have a really polished setup, we will use Amazon Prime to buy an
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.440]   Audio-Technica 2100 mic and ship it to them.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.880]   And it's very easy to do.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.360]   It's 80 to 100 bucks.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.640]   And that may not make any sense in the beginning or be feasible in the beginning.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.480]   But right now, for the type of operation that I run and very quickly, the cost of
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.200]   rescheduling is more to me than 80 to 100 dollars.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.000]   However, you can have a great mic and a really terrible room.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.360]   So if someone's in a room with lots of metal, lots of glass, you could have a very
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.920]   bouncy room even with a decent mic.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   So there are other technical tricks that are not really tricks, but you could have a
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.400]   mediocre mic in a room with lots of carpet and drapes and you're going to probably have
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:43.680]   better sound than a really nice mic in some highly modern metallic glass bouncy room.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.960]   If you end up in that type of environment, there are tricks you can use like putting
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.360]   pillows in the corners of the room.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.920]   That's what I learned from Edward Norton.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.160]   Actually, he was in a really bouncy room and he said, hold on, I know how to fix this.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   And he fixed it. I was like, wow, that's genius.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.400]   So you do get better at these things over time.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:07.080]   But I very rarely reschedule unless one of us is sick or the sound quality is
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.640]   absolutely abysmal.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:17.320]   But. A bridge line recording is not going to give you Carnegie Hall symphony quality
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.680]   fidelity, but nobody really cares, is what I've realized.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.600]   I don't use equalizers.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.680]   I don't use any of these external devices that one might think are necessary.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.560]   Yes, they can improve quality sometimes.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:40.640]   But as Morgan Spurlock said to me on this podcast, once you get fancy, fancy gets
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.720]   broken. And I prefer to have the fewest number of moving pieces possible.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:53.320]   When I record in person just to cover that, I use the Zoom H6 recording device with XLR
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.560]   cables and generally SM58 stage microphones, which are Shure microphones.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.880]   They're the oldest microphones you can imagine.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.360]   Yes. So you have the H6.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   You could take the SM58 mic and probably throw it against a brick wall and it would be
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.480]   fine. That's my guess.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.040]   And I can throw all of that gear into a backpack.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.240]   I can travel with my entire podcast studio, so to speak.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.800]   It's been good enough for between 600 and 700 episodes, and I don't have any plans to
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   change. So that is the gear.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.880]   I use a similar setup, and I would say, I don't know if you know a specific one, you
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.320]   could go listen to the episodes I've done.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.960]   And one of them, someone had no headphones, no microphone.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.280]   We were just using a MacBook.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.480]   And I'd be shocked if someone could actually, that isn't an audio engineer, could go
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.880]   back and pick out which one it is.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.440]   Pro tip that we ended up using earlier in this conversation, which I picked up from
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.720]   Kevin Rose, actually, who has a lot of experience with this kind of thing, is if
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.320]   you're doing a remote recording.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.720]   And you ask someone to check their source to make sure the inputs and outputs are set
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.880]   properly, they might say my mic is selected, but if it sounds funny to you, ask them to
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.960]   tap the mic.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:14.440]   If they tap the mic and you don't hear that, right, that that kind of punchy tapping
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.200]   sound, then it means it is not selected.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.480]   It's probably their headset or the built-in microphone on the laptop.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.920]   So that's an easy way to test to see if the proper external mic is selected.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.320]   All right, Chris, what else should we cover?
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.440]   So I think we covered gear a lot.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.360]   One thing you mentioned was video.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.120]   Early on, your advice to people was don't use video.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.920]   It makes it easier for guests.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.520]   You can look at your notes.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.440]   You said that's evolved a little bit.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.000]   We're recording video today.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.560]   How do you think about that differently now?
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.080]   Or do you think about it differently in a way that wouldn't apply to someone else?
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:59.360]   I record video now if someone wants to record and if I think it will improve the
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.240]   rapport in some fashion.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:09.280]   I still frequently record without video because I like to have lots of notes.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.200]   I do quite a bit of homework.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.720]   My team does quite a bit of homework for each guest.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.360]   And I like to have my notes in front of me.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.320]   And it sometimes can be very distracting if you're having a conversation with
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.200]   someone on video and you're looking off screen like Rain Man.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:31.440]   I also like the ability to set, and I always set both the laptop and my iPhone
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.640]   to do not disturb because you might just receive a FaceTime audio call and that
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.040]   could mess up your interview.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:37.800]   It does happen.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.840]   I've seen it.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   I've experienced it.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.640]   It's not fun.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.640]   So do not disturb, do not disturb.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.480]   But with do not disturb on my iPhone, if I'm not using video, you could also take
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.320]   yourself off video temporarily to do this.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   Or you could tell the guest in advance that if you check your iPhone, you're not
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.480]   checking email, you're Googling something.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.360]   What will sometimes happen is a guest will say, oh, well, there's a book by so
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.440]   and so it's called this.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.080]   I can't remember the author name.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.560]   You can look that up.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.040]   Or they will say there are three people who are really good at X, Y, and Z.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.840]   They'll name two.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.440]   And then they'll say the second person.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.640]   I think their first name is Laura or Brian.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   And you can look it up so you don't have to deal with it in post-production or put
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.360]   it in the show notes.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.560]   You can look it up on an iPhone and no one who is listening will hear you tap the
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.280]   iPhone, but they will very often hear you tap a laptop.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   So I use my phone in that way.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.080]   Now you could have a production assistant or a producer or an engineer or someone
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.320]   like that who would do this for you, which is what Joe Rogan does.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.520]   But I don't do that.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.760]   I have a smaller team, by the way, it works spectacularly well.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.200]   Now, speaking of Joe, so Joe Rogan is fluent in video.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:01.400]   He is absolutely adept and expert and comfortable being in front of the cameras
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.040]   and making really good use of cameras.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:08.360]   I think one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the major reasons that
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.440]   Joe has become as big as he has is his use of YouTube.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   I don't know if it's still the second largest search engine in the world, but it
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:22.240]   is an enormous traffic driver, particularly if you take not just your long form
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.320]   videos and put them online, but create clips as he has through JRE clips and so
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:35.680]   on. And if you are bringing on guests who are going to be capitalizing on news or
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:42.200]   who are part of the news themselves, then people will be searching for these
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.320]   temporarily relevant topics, whether it's someone who got fired, someone who got in
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.120]   trouble, someone who made a big decision, a CEO who just found themselves in the
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.440]   news. If you do that, you can drive a lot of traffic.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:02.600]   I want to produce, for the most part, evergreen episodes that will have very fat
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.920]   tales they get listened to for years and years and years and don't lose their
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.360]   relevance. That's important to me.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:15.120]   And I don't want to immerse myself in the news any more than absolutely necessary.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.600]   So I don't do that. I also don't think that I am as good on video as Joe.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.000]   He has a studio.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   He has a visually interesting environment.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.960]   He is funny.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.120]   He's a comedian.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.600]   He's an entertainer, very smart entertainer, but he's a very, very, very skilled
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.160]   entertainer. And it makes sense.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.720]   And they have just more production capacity.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.080]   They've invested more in making that a core component of what they do.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.320]   I just am not interested enough.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.520]   Could I make my show bigger?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.880]   Would it be bigger if I tried to do all of that?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.960]   I think it would be.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.920]   But this is an example of knowing where you are strong, knowing where you are
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.280]   perhaps not as strong and also asking yourself, why am I doing this?
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.120]   Does my show, does the Tim Ferriss show need to be two times bigger, three times
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.160]   bigger, ten times bigger?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.840]   I can't come up with a really compelling reason for why that's the case.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   Would I like it to grow?
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.200]   Yes. Do I need it to grow even if it involves doing things I dislike?
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.240]   No, that would be so stupid.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.200]   It would be so stupid.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.360]   And I've made that mistake.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:31.280]   You're at a scale now that your show can afford the person to help you prep for
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.360]   guests and that kind of stuff.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.320]   What do you think about people earlier?
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.840]   I'm at a place right now where I've recorded the video of a lot of my
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   interviews, but I haven't done anything with it yet.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.720]   And I know it could help grow the show and the show couldn't monetize to support
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.080]   it. So growth is kind of a factor.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.840]   It plays into the longevity of the show because it takes time.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.640]   And yes, I would do it for free, but you got bills, you got people have things
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.480]   they have to do. So if they want to do it more, it does need to grow.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.320]   Do you think it would be different if your show was smaller and it couldn't
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.920]   afford all of those things?
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.880]   Yeah, well, let me let me dig into a bunch of.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:15.960]   Pieces of what you just said and ask some follow up questions, so how different
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.080]   would my operation look if I were just getting started?
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.360]   Well, let's rewind the clock.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.760]   I can tell you exactly what I did when I got started.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.040]   I wanted to know how to do everything and that's part of my nature.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.320]   But it's also because I wanted to try to create as elegant an operation
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.520]   as possible for myself.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.440]   Elegant is not does not have the same definition, doesn't have the same puzzle
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.640]   pieces for everyone. So I not only recorded everything myself,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.920]   I edited everything myself.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.200]   I published everything myself.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.360]   I uploaded the file to hosting services
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.160]   and so on and so forth.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.000]   So in the very early days, I didn't have someone to help me with research.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.600]   I still appreciate and value having someone to help me with research.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.920]   But if for whatever reason that weren't possible, I have full confidence that I
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.040]   could do that myself. But let's let's take a look at something you said.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.200]   And that is and it comes back to this question I had earlier of
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.760]   is the podcast still worth it? Right.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.800]   To get to episode 50, episode 100 for you.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.240]   What does the podcast need to be for?
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.920]   It to be worth doing, well worth doing, easily worth doing.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.960]   Right. So you said we got bills.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.040]   Shit, got bills to pay, got to keep this ship afloat.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.120]   Now, I don't have a perfect window into all of your personal finances,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.760]   but I have on some reasonable authority,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.840]   sufficient belief that you could probably cover your podcasting bills.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.560]   And I know the costs involved with a lot of podcasting without having to monetize
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.920]   the show. So it would be nice to monetize the show,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.880]   but you could make that money in some other way.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.680]   So let me jump to a point about monetizing that I mentioned.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.480]   I believe in that 2016 article,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.520]   and probably again with Rolf Potts on Deviate and that is in the beginning,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.600]   I did not focus on monetization. Now it's very easy for someone to say, well,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.040]   you already had money. Therefore, your advice doesn't apply to me.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.480]   Your experience doesn't apply to me.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.000]   I would discourage you from looking at it with that lens, you meaning listener,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.760]   because you can learn something from everyone.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.520]   And even if their decisions are not the decisions you would make,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.640]   it's helpful to learn how more experienced people have thought about it.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.520]   So the way they go about making decisions,
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.960]   I felt, especially since I was doing the editing and so on myself,
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.000]   that any focus on monetization,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.560]   even if you think it's only going to be 5% of your time,
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.800]   and we can come back to sort of preoccupation versus active time on
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   something, I didn't want anything to distract from my focus
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.920]   on improving my ability to prepare an interview and edit.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.840]   I wanted to focus on the craft, the product, and that was it.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.800]   That was to be my real soul focus, which the editing helps with,
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.440]   by the way, the editing forces you to listen to everything really carefully,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.800]   not saying everyone should edit their own stuff.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.360]   I no longer edit my own episodes,
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   but we do get everything transcribed and we go through and we look at ways to
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.440]   clean up and tighten and possibly cut or rearrange.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.640]   We do that with a lot of episodes, not all of them.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:42.760]   So I didn't focus on or pay attention to monetizing for the first,
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.440]   I don't know, I'd have to go back and somebody could probably confirm this,
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.960]   but who knows 60, 70, a hundred episodes, I'm not even sure.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.600]   By that point,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.360]   the downloads were such that I had a
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.920]   broader spectrum of possible sponsors to choose from.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.160]   And that felt better to me than taking whatever came over the transom
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.680]   early. However, I believe Chris,
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.400]   one of your questions that you had for me was along the lines of,
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.720]   should I say no to things that come over the transom?
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.360]   So let me take a step back and I will answer that,
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.000]   but how are you thinking about monetizing? Because it is very easy.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.240]   And I'm not saying this to you, Chris, specifically,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.360]   but for people to get pulled away
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.320]   from the creative by the siren song,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.600]   the mesmerizing nature of monetizing,
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   because every time you go on Twitter, there's something trending. That's like,
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.800]   here's how much top influencers get paid on Instagram. And you're like, what?
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.240]   A hundred thousand dollars a post. That's crazy.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.880]   I want to make a hundred thousand dollars a post. And then, oh boy,
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.480]   then you're lost. So how are you thinking about monetizing right now?
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.440]   And I should say, Chris is smart. You're smart with your money.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.120]   You are very deliberate and you've done a lot of homework.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.280]   You're a student of personal finance and money,
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.880]   but how are you thinking about monetizing and what to do or not do with it?
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.760]   Yeah. So I think I took a similar approach to you and it was maybe for a
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.600]   slightly, if your reason was to hone the craft,
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.320]   mine was to prove out the longevity.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.640]   So going to spend any time monetizing your podcast before you realize
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.280]   this is something that I could do for a long time,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.880]   which you will never know until you do it for at least, you did six.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.840]   For me, it probably took five or 10, maybe 10 episodes. Until that point,
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.080]   it would have been a complete waste of time to think about monetizing because I
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.520]   didn't know if I was going to do this.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.760]   And the amount of money you're going to make on a 10 episode podcast is almost
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.840]   nothing. So I said,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.720]   let's make sure this is something I could do forever before I think about it.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.200]   Then I thought, okay,
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:54.040]   let's also make sure that the amount of money it would generate is even worth
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.840]   the effort. Sponsors have reached out and said, Oh,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.240]   we want to advertise on two episodes. It's like, okay, but like,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.800]   if I'm going to sell, you know, two sponsors on a show, two episodes at a time,
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.240]   we're talking 50 calls a year to sponsors.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.920]   And that's just the ones that say yes. So maybe you're, you're doing, you know,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.240]   200 calls to try to line sponsors up.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.760]   That just seemed like a distraction for how much it would make.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.160]   So I had a similar kind of thought,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.880]   which is get to a point in time where the amount of money you'd make for the
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.600]   amount of work it would take to bring that money in is worth it.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.160]   And the only deviation from that was when people called outreach and say, Hey,
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.680]   can we just do this? And it's like, well, now it's no longer work.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.200]   But even then I've since decided to say no,
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.280]   not because I think it would ruin the show,
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.880]   but just because I have a list of things that I prioritize. And for me,
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.720]   it's making the content great and finding the people to bring on.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   If I spend time on anything else,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.440]   it takes away from that and that is not yet on autopilot.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.680]   And I think ultimately that's all that really matters.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.840]   Like your show's not going to be good if it's not something people enjoy
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.480]   listening to,
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.640]   which is usually a factor of who's talking and how much those people have thought
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.880]   about what they're going to say or,
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.400]   or at least prepared to have a good conversation.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.120]   Yeah, I think that makes a whole lot of sense.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.440]   A couple of thoughts also on monetizing,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.560]   figure out what would be amazing from a
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.640]   monetizing perspective.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.560]   And I'm very deliberately not saying sponsorship or advertising perspective,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.440]   because there are many different ways to convert a podcast
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.080]   into shouldn't say convert as a side effect of doing an
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.200]   awesome podcast to produce income.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.880]   Let's just say you are a high priced consultant and you don't have
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   any advertising, but you generate clients from the podcast.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.960]   That would be a somewhat straightforward example.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.480]   You could have as many people do, especially in the early days,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.560]   affiliate relationships, very often the most lucrative of which are going to be
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.000]   with certain types of products, right? Domain services, hosting, et cetera.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.960]   They have a very high stickiness with their
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.040]   customers, high level of stickiness, low churn rate,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.360]   which means high lifetime value.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.720]   They're willing to pay you quite a bit upfront, but is that what you want?
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Are those the products, services, et cetera,
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.120]   that you want to be endorsing? Maybe, maybe not.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.400]   There are many different ways to approach this many different ways to
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.040]   generate income. Perhaps you have a newsletter,
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.360]   that is a paid newsletter and people sign up for that.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.480]   Perhaps you have a different version of the podcast,
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.640]   or you have a membership of some sort outside of newsletters.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.960]   Maybe people pay for the show notes.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.160]   These are all real examples that I've seen for myself.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.760]   I decided that sponsorship was the easiest.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.480]   I've done some experiments with membership and they all just entailed more
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.600]   headache for me.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.920]   And I felt ultimately less value all around than
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.800]   sponsorships. Assuming in my case that I am using or
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.760]   testing everything personally,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.520]   that is where the sponsorships are somewhat
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.440]   time-consuming for me. But I don't,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.640]   I don't mind it because I actually use like, if you walked around my house,
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.120]   you would recognize all sorts of stuff from my sponsors.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.880]   And I don't just have them because they're sponsors.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.200]   Like I have them because they are good products or services.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.040]   And let me give a couple of examples of
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.760]   questioning best practices or standard operating procedure
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.240]   with sponsors.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.080]   And this may help people to simplify their approach.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.960]   So I did not ask myself,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.280]   how can I make as much money with sponsors through the podcast?
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.920]   Because there are no constraints on that.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.800]   You're not applying constraints in such a way to ensure that your
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.480]   life does not become a miserable existence of just being a
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.920]   pinata for every ask and request of dozens of
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.280]   sponsors, right? As it might be in the example that you gave,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.960]   that could be a huge pain in the ass.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.480]   So what constraints could you apply to ensure that it does not become a
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.080]   monster you have to feed or a huge distraction?
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.280]   A very simple constraint that I applied was, A,
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.600]   we're going to have our own insertion order document that is going to be
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.640]   non-negotiable and everyone is going to prepay for their spots.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.520]   We will not have any terms. We're not going to have accounts receivable.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.440]   We're not going to chase people for payment.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.320]   Everybody is going to pay up front.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.560]   And what do you think the response was from sponsors? Initially,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.920]   the response was, what the fuck are you talking about?
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.560]   We get terms from everyone. That's how this is done. And I said, that's fine.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.440]   We don't have to work together.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.880]   This is just what allows me and my tiny team to remain sane.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.680]   So if it's not worth it, it's not worth it. I totally understand.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.640]   Let me get back to work and make the podcast so good that they're
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   we'll be at least a few sponsors. We're going to say, you know what? Fuck it.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   We will pay you up front.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.880]   And that is something we have stuck to.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.640]   And I cannot tell you how much that has simplified our lives and our
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.480]   operations.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.560]   It also acts as a litmus test for commitment from
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.800]   sponsors, because as you noted to fill,
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.720]   let's just say in your case, right?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.880]   50 different sponsors at two spots a piece.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.640]   If you have a high churn rate,
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.080]   meaning a lot of those people take two episodes and then split and never come
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.200]   back, you're just going to have to do that again next year. That's exhausting.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.920]   Right? So I want to make sure there's a high level of commitment,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.600]   but there's also a high level of vetting on my side.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.720]   Therefore a high probability that the
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.040]   product and the company will do really,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.640]   really well on the podcast because I don't want them to do two or three spots.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.960]   And we do insist on a test of multiple spots.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.800]   Not sure if it's two right now, it might be three. And my podcast is expensive.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.600]   Very, very, very expensive. I mean, it's a premium podcast.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.880]   I want them to spend millions of dollars on the podcast over a long period of
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.720]   time.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.960]   So everything is geared towards that because it's,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.160]   it just simplifies everything for everyone.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.000]   But the point I wanted to make is question best practices.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.200]   And if you are not in a position to question best practices,
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.360]   your product isn't good enough,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.440]   or you just don't have enough leverage for some reason.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.560]   And you should take a very close look at those reasons,
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.120]   but it doesn't hurt to ask for instance,
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.440]   what does every almost 99% of authors out there
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.680]   do? They publish a book in hardcover six to nine months later,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.480]   the book comes out in paperback and they hit the press junket once
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.240]   again, and they go on tour to announce the launch of paperback.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:23.280]   None of my books have ever gone to paperback. Why is that Tim Ferriss?
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.360]   I'll tell you it's because, and the numbers vary, but not by that much.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:33.440]   Let's say that you're getting a 12% royalty on your
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.400]   hardcover book.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.360]   Paperback royalties is probably going to be 6%, six and a half percent.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.720]   So broadly speaking, paperback royalties are,
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.120]   you'll get paid 50% of what you're currently earning per book by
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.920]   going to paperback. What does that mean?
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.560]   That means you have to sell twice as many books to make the same amount
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.960]   of money. I'm skipping over some specifics here,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.680]   but more or less you have to sell twice as many books to make what you're making
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:11.160]   right now. What is the benefit to the reader of this? Well,
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   we live in a world with audio with Kindle
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.000]   and the benefit to the customer.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   We also have libraries where you can get e-format for free oftentimes.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.960]   And actually I learned of a very cool,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.160]   I think it was a Chrome extension on your podcast. In fact, about this,
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.560]   the benefit to the consumer used to be they could save whatever it might be
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.800]   $5 on cover price with Amazon,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.120]   which is generally selling it almost often close to wholesale prices.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.600]   That benefit just no longer exists.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.800]   So for a marginal to non-existent benefit to the end reader,
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.520]   you are going to voluntarily cut your royalties in half,
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.040]   which means you have to sell twice as many books to earn the same amount per
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   year. That made no sense to me. So I've never done it.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.680]   And to their credit, my publishers early on,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.840]   we're open to this logic for staying in hard cover.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.920]   And it worked out really, really well.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.400]   I did not have a lot of leverage in the beginning, right?
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.280]   I did not have sort of Tim Ferriss and Mara Key lights as people,
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.840]   or some people perceive it today. I simply laid out the logic, right?
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.120]   So really question what you have to do,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.520]   because sometimes those best practices make no sense whatsoever.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.680]   Getting the crew together. Isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.440]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.240]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.320]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.280]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor drizzly,
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.720]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.800]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.320]   It doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.080]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.040]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week with
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.240]   drizzly. You can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.280]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.000]   leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.320]   drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine,
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.320]   and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.640]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.960]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.320]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   So whatever the occasion download the drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   That's D R I Z L Y.com today must be 21
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.600]   plus not available in all locations.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.960]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money,
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.160]   and so much more,
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.160]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.640]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.920]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor Long Angle.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.760]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.160]   manufacturing, and more. I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.720]   I've loved being a part of the community and I've even had one of the founders
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.600]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87,
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.200]   to talk about alternative investments. Now,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.920]   the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.840]   highly successful individuals who joined the community to share knowledge and
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.400]   learn from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting. On top of that,
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.880]   members also get access to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.960]   Like I said,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.200]   I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.520]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:52.080]   everything from your investment portfolio to your children's education,
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.920]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.880]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.720]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.280]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.440]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle and it's totally free to join.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.360]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more. And if you choose to apply,
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.800]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here. Again,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.240]   that's longangle.com.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:23.720]   We've talked about getting ready and all of that, but I'm curious.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.440]   I think the bulk of what goes into podcasting is finding guests,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.120]   prepping for the conversation and having the conversation.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.440]   And I'll tell everyone, even if you don't have a podcast,
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.000]   thinking about how to find interesting people and to have a better,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.320]   more informative, exciting conversation is probably valuable just in life.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.200]   I mean, you said the reason you got started, and if you never continued,
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.520]   you will have at least learned the skill that was really valuable.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.360]   So I'll start with finding people.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.920]   When you first wrote your original post,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.360]   there wasn't that much about finding people, you know,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.840]   look for people you're interested in.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.800]   The one thing that you said,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.960]   maybe not in that post that I thought was really interesting was don't put as
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.720]   much value as you think on how big of a name they are.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.920]   That maybe half of your top episodes are people that your listeners had never
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.760]   heard of before.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.800]   And so it just keeps coming back to content is really,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.640]   really important.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.000]   And people like good content more than they like bad content with a fancy name.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.480]   I can attest to some of the episodes where I thought people had the smallest
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.120]   names that no one had ever heard of have far outperformed conversations I've had
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.080]   with like Ramit Sethi, who, you know,
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.840]   we had a great conversation and lots of people know his name.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.400]   And that is something that I don't think I thought going in would ever be true.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.640]   Yes.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.800]   Why, yes, let's jump in.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.640]   So this comes back to the initial question of why do
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:58.320]   you want to do a podcast and maybe it should be framed differently.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.440]   What is so compelling about this that you're going to want to do a hundred
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.280]   episodes of this podcast? Maybe that's the question.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.920]   What is so compelling about this that you will be so thrilled about doing a
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.720]   hundred episodes of this podcast that you would pay,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.560]   not get paid, but you would pay to do this podcast?
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.760]   Chances are the answer is not banging your head against a
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.600]   wall,
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.640]   trying to get through a phalanx of publicists and lawyers and managers
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.920]   and getting the runaround from like Hollywood entourage for a
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.760]   year to get a guest. Chances are, you wouldn't pay to do that.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:43.920]   If you chase famous people, you are going to do that just to be clear.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.800]   So maybe you should focus on doing something that
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.640]   really satisfies you. And maybe in some niche,
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.200]   God knows where some way, somehow it's so fucking good
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.120]   that like a hundred people who might know famous people are like, wow,
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.800]   this is really smart. That's not guaranteed, but it's a possibility.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.840]   So for me,
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.720]   the answer is follow your interests
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.240]   and make it easy in the beginning. So in the first,
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.360]   I want to say five to 10, maybe 20 or 30 episodes,
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:26.520]   I only interviewed people I knew quite well because I
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.320]   didn't need the nerves of interviewing a stranger
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:36.360]   to add to what was already somewhat challenging. Does that make sense?
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.400]   And I remember, I think it was Ed Catmull,
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.000]   the former president of Pixar,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.840]   who was the first person I'd ever interviewed who I
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.160]   hadn't had a conversation with prior to the actual interview.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.000]   And it was nerve wracking ended up being a really fun
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.920]   interview, but it was very stressful for me. Why?
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.640]   I couldn't really pinpoint because I talked to strangers all the time.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:08.920]   And that's certainly true with the books, but it felt different.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.040]   So make it as easy as possible in the beginning,
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.760]   stack the decks so that you can win in the beginning.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.920]   And for me, that meant doing it with friends.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.600]   In terms of finding guests,
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:26.680]   there are as many ways as you could imagine and
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.440]   probably more than you could imagine,
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.560]   but the focus of the show will direct how you search.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.400]   So in my case, the Tim Ferriss show
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.960]   has always been about world-class performers in different
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   disciplines and trying to tease out the habits, routines, favorite books,
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:48.600]   et cetera,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:53.120]   that make them tick or that they think might contribute to making them good at
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:57.280]   what they do. Frameworks, decisions,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.440]   thought process, all of that. Turns out that's very, very broad.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.920]   So I have some people on the docket. Like there's a,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.800]   I think it's a violin assessor,
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.120]   like a valuator,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.640]   someone who assesses and rehabilitates, you know,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.560]   multi-million dollar violins.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.480]   I can tell you with great confidence that that does not have a large
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.720]   built-in audience,
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.600]   but it's interesting to me.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.960]   And I also think about which guests
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.720]   will care enough to bring their A game.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   It doesn't matter how famous your guest is.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   It doesn't matter how good your guest is. If they don't bring their A game,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.200]   Chris, one of the things you asked me,
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.360]   if I'd be willing to do is listen to a few episodes,
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.800]   your podcast and provide feedback.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.200]   And the first episode I listened to was actually the first episode you
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.000]   published, which I learned later was the fifth that you'd recorded,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.080]   which is smart on pro travel hacks with, is it Lee Rowan?
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.840]   Yep. Is that how you say the last name? Yeah. Rowan. And,
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.400]   and Lee is amazing.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.720]   Lee is like Sam Harris. If he didn't have a teleprompter or something,
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.120]   that man speaks and finished prose. It's ridiculous. Right? So,
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:21.960]   so Lee is one of those guests who clearly brought his A game.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.080]   And I thought you did a very good job in the interview.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.400]   And it's an area where you have a lot of domain expertise,
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:33.320]   but honestly you could have been making like zoo animal noises and he could have
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.200]   just run. And it would have been a incredible interview slash monologue.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.920]   Do you know what I mean? If you were just like, I'm going to give you words,
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.760]   that I pull out of this hat and I want you to riff for five minutes.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.080]   And you're like, uh, Arthropod, uh,
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.240]   tax optimization, uh, grizzly bears.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.920]   Like I'm sure it would have been a really fascinating conversation because Lee
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.680]   is just that good. You know what I mean? There are those guests.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.200]   Esther Perel is one who comes to mind immediately. Hugh Jackman was,
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.360]   was like that for me. There are many guests, including those,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.760]   you wouldn't recognize who are going to be really,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.840]   really, really good.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:21.200]   So a big part of guest selection is also
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.880]   improving as an interviewer in quotation marks.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.400]   Ultimately it is very hard to fix a bad guest.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.000]   It does not matter how good you are as an interviewer.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.360]   The only fix that I have found is if I generally budget 90 to 120 minutes for an
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.280]   interview, I'll usually say 90.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:44.040]   If I get 30 minutes in and I'm like, Oh my God, this is a stillborn.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.360]   Like this is a mess. This is, we're not getting anywhere, which by the way,
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.720]   it can happen with people who are very, very, very good conversationalists.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.160]   But as soon as you hit record,
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   once it's an interview and not a conversation over wine at dinner,
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.040]   they get really stilted and weird and can't be themselves.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.400]   That happens quite often. Then I will talk more.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.080]   This doesn't work for everyone. It won't work for everyone,
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.200]   but generally I'm going to come into the interview.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.800]   Having done a lot of homework, I'll have some domain familiarity,
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   if not expertise.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:21.240]   And I will then ask a question where I can reciprocate and give examples or by
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.560]   time by talking about something else. And in doing so,
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.840]   I will extend the time we might record for two to two and a half hours.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:35.320]   And then we can cut that down to say 30 to 60 minutes.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.560]   30 to 60 minutes. It will probably include a lot of me.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.880]   And the downside to that is people will be like, wow,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.840]   this guy really likes to hear himself talk. And it's like, no,
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.520]   I just saved this interview.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.480]   And at the end of the day,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:52.040]   there will be some actionable takeaways within that interview, right?
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.320]   So that's one way to save it.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   I will only try to save in an interview like that if someone is at least trying
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.560]   and they have done the prep work. So when I talk to people,
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   or I should say prior to ever interviewing people will have a list of
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.520]   commonly asked rapid fire questions, which I have right here.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:17.040]   People will recognize a lot of them from tribe of mentors and other places,
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.240]   but there are certain questions I ask a lot like the metaphorical billboard
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.800]   question, favorite failures, et cetera, right?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.600]   There's certain questions I ask frequently.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.800]   I send this to people in advance.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   I generally don't send other questions in advance and I always talk to people
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.560]   beforehand for five to 10 minutes before recording to loosen them up.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.040]   This is assuming they're not somebody who's got a publicist cracking the whip on
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.720]   my face. It's assuming they have a little bit of slack in the system.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.320]   We'll talk in the beginning. I will first say you,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.680]   like all of my guests have final cut. You can see a transcript beforehand.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.720]   You can listen to the audio, any edits you want to make. We can make,
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.640]   this is not a show about gotchas. So number one,
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.440]   there's that and I will say I've been screwed by journalists before I've been,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.040]   had my trust betrayed. I've had things cherry picked. I've been misquoted.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.120]   It sucks. I'm not going to do that. And you have final cut,
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.480]   which by the way is what inside the actors studio always did.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.040]   And what you might've seen on TV for those episodes,
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.200]   45 minutes an hour was actually several hours of recording.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   They would cut down substantially. So I'll do that first.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.760]   And in the say warmup calisthenics,
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.080]   I will always ask someone what would make this interview a home run?
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.440]   When you look back three, six months from now,
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.320]   what would make this an absolute home run where when people ask you,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.200]   what are your favorite two or three interviews?
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.720]   This is one of those two or three.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:53.760]   And people are always almost always surprised when I asked
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.320]   that because it's, it's never asked.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.840]   And I'll tell them because that can inform how I try to steer the
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.000]   conversation. It will also inform how we promote the episode.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.920]   So let me know if you have an answer. And if not, if you have an answer later,
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.160]   we can try to customize things. I will also ask them,
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.040]   is there anything you absolutely don't want to talk about
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.800]   or something that you're really sick of talking about that you just don't want
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.280]   to rehash? I will ask that.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.360]   And by the time you ask these questions or these types of questions,
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.960]   a, someone has warmed up a little bit B,
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.280]   they will think to themselves, okay, wow,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.200]   this guy's really put some thought into this is aware that I'm coming into this
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.800]   with certain goals and hopes or fears.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   And this is not his first rodeo.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.320]   And what I'll also then tell people is we can always cut things later,
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:56.360]   but we can't put interesting things in.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.520]   So feel free to curse, be yourself, like, let it all hang out.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.760]   We can always cut things later, but we can't put it in.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.280]   We can't put the fun in so go crazy.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.360]   And we can always cut, I would say out of whatever it is now,
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.080]   six to 700 episodes,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:21.560]   less than 3% of the guests ever ask to see the audio or
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.600]   transcript. It's very uncommon,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.680]   but I will take notes as we talk.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.480]   And if someone say mentioned something like a lawsuit,
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.200]   which might be legally complicated for them,
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.000]   it weren't broadcast to millions of people or just made public to
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.560]   honestly, an audience of a hundred people,
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.200]   or if they mentioned say details about their family or where they live,
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.720]   or they say, let me give out my email address.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.960]   I will flag all of those things and I will talk to them afterwards and say,
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.280]   do you want to keep this in? Are you sure you want to keep this in?
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:03.720]   I would suggest you cut this dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, to look out for them also.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.280]   And then my team will also listen to things and review transcripts to try to
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.720]   identify other things that should be cut.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.040]   Twitter is an excellent way to source guests to come back to that question.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.640]   You asked so long ago, Twitter's an excellent way to find guests.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.800]   Although part of my feedback to you on your podcast is you
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.960]   mentioned Twitter a lot and Twitter is a very, even though it's expanded a lot,
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.560]   and I'm sure it rankles Twitter to death that Donald Trump kind of saved
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.240]   Twitter. How funny is that?
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.040]   It's still a very tech-centric environment.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.760]   And so I would suggest to you that you drive people
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.800]   to the website and preferably some type of newsletter so
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:54.560]   that you have the ability to communicate directly with your listeners.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.680]   Podcasting is still largely a black box.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.960]   It's very difficult to get good analytics.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.040]   This is also why it's very difficult for me to give growth advice.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.480]   Because it's very difficult to confirm attribution
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.000]   for different types of organic or paid acquisition or
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.520]   PR. It's incredibly difficult. We can talk about growth.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.440]   I'm happy to talk about it,
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.320]   but the reason Twitter works specifically for guest
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.000]   recruitment is probably similar to how you could use other
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.720]   platforms, but my other platforms are completely deluged. For instance,
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.080]   maybe you could use Instagram DMs for this,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.120]   but because I'm flooded by DMs and anyone apparently can send me a
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.960]   DM on Instagram, I can't use it. There's too much noise, not enough signal.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.160]   So it's an unusable tool for me. But on Twitter,
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.000]   if you follow someone and then you like something of theirs,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.120]   and then you retweet, and it's a lot easier if you have a verified account,
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.480]   of course, to get someone's attention. But if you follow them, like something,
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.480]   retweet something, maybe reply to something of theirs and kind of do it all at
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.760]   once so that you occupy more of their timeline,
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.440]   if they're looking at replies and things like this, if they follow you,
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.200]   you can DM them. And if you DM them and connect with them,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.320]   you can do so without having any of their contact information.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.440]   You don't have their email address. You don't have their phone number.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.680]   If they dislike you, they can block you. In other words,
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.600]   they don't have the same fear factor associated with you having a
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.120]   direct line to them in any fashion. So for Tribe of Mentors, as an example,
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:39.960]   the book,
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.160]   there were a hundred maybe 120 people who answered many of the
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.280]   common questions for the podcast.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.760]   And the way I connected with Ben Stiller and dozens
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.360]   of the larger celebrities, better known figures was through Twitter.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.080]   That is how I made contact with them.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.600]   It is also a very good way to make contact with well-known people,
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.520]   or even if they're not well-known,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.480]   difficult to reach people and to circumvent around their
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.720]   multiple layers of entourage.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.920]   Because if you email an agent or a manager,
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.560]   just get ready for the merry-go-round of bullshit to start.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.960]   And there are some great agents and managers out there.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.880]   I don't want to imply that there aren't,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.640]   but if you're dealing with anything related to Hollywood, nine times out of 10,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.520]   you are just going to get this incredible runaround dance that
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.880]   can last forever.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.080]   There are some incredibly talented and hardworking and great
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.520]   agents and managers. So again,
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:47.360]   not to malign all of those people in those categories,
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.800]   but you run the risk of an incredible amount of hurry up and
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.680]   wait that can last years. Even at this point for me,
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.520]   by the way, that is true. Do you think if you had their email,
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.200]   you would use it over Twitter or is it, you think Twitter is a better medium?
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.400]   It might be better. It may be less crowded.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.120]   It depends entirely on how many people they follow.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.440]   So it depends a lot.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.280]   I will say that as someone who gets an
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:25.160]   incredible amount of bullshit sent to me through one means or
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.000]   another,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.040]   that if I have channels that are intended for people to get in touch
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.000]   with me and they disregard those channels and think they're clever by barraging
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.640]   me somehow, they're immediately blacklisted.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.600]   And most people, if they do get a random email from you,
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.400]   what I would suggest,
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.200]   if you're going to take that approach that you indicate in the email,
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.600]   how you got their email address,
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.800]   no one on my team will ever reply to someone who cold emails,
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.520]   or if they try to get a hold on like phones or anything like that immediate
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.080]   blacklist, but maybe via email, if they reach out,
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.800]   if they don't indicate how they found the email, no response,
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.960]   like they need to clarify that first.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.240]   But if they have channels for getting in touch with them,
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.760]   I would suggest that first, unless they're the, their agency.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.120]   It's not that you can't and should never reach out to an agent or
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.760]   a PR agency or a
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.160]   manager to try to reach say a celebrity
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:33.120]   or someone who's well-known it's that you should expect that to take a lot of
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.940]   time.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:39.200]   And an alternative or a compliment to that
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   would be Twitter with all of the time.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.360]   And this is true actually for a lot of optimizing in general, for me,
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.880]   even though I am fascinated by sort of,
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.120]   we can talk about what kind of what optimize means, right.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.080]   Optimize for what is a good question when thinking about a lot of these things.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:57.920]   But
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:04.040]   if I think about the number of pod casters or would be podcasters who ask
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.640]   me about guest recruitment,
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.880]   and they don't need my help to get 90% of the
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   people out there. So really the question is,
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.080]   how do I get guests who are hard to reach? That's the question.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.280]   If they completely avoided guests who are hard to reach and just
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.920]   focused on fucking recording another 10 episodes in the same
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.200]   amount of time,
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.840]   the same number of hours that they're going to blow trying to get Oprah on their
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   podcast. God bless Oprah. I wish I could have her on my podcast.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.560]   I don't think it's going to happen. I think they would be much further ahead.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:42.960]   At the end of the day,
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.800]   I'll say two things about that first episode I did with Lee one,
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.040]   Lee had never been on another podcast.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.200]   So Lee is not a celebrity name that I think anyone knows.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.560]   And that podcast,
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.960]   that first episode has had two and a half times more downloads than every other
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.320]   episode. Yeah. So it's content way over the name.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.080]   And the other thing, just cause I thought it was a funny example of technology
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.240]   failing. So in that episode, we actually recorded in person.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:16.000]   We used a zoom and we had a bad SD card, no backup.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.280]   And so that episode was actually three days
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.640]   later, re-recording the episodes. It was a little different than the original,
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.520]   but I will say going into that,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.680]   I had this huge fear that you'll never be able to recreate a good episode if you
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.200]   have to. And I'm not saying I would ever encourage it,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.320]   but that fear was kind of busted.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.720]   So I would rather have had the backup of the original because it's hard to try
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.400]   to, to keep it going. But if you have to, it's not always a bad outcome.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.920]   Not always bad outcome.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.520]   So I should actually modify my gear recommendation and say that I also have
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.480]   redundancy in person. So I have the H six, I've got that.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.880]   Usually I'll have another H six sitting out and
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.280]   recording, but without the, the XLR.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.520]   So it'll be sort of a field recording set up.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.440]   I may also have an iPhone with a
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:18.280]   lightning port connected shore microphone.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.040]   They make some really, really cool, smaller microphones.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.680]   I can't remember the exact model number,
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.320]   but I will have redundancy in person as well
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.200]   as backup options remotely. Now I want to come back to one thing.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.240]   And for those people who want to find this episode,
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.040]   we'll link to it in the show notes, obviously for the pro travel hacks,
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.600]   episode number one of all the hacks.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.080]   I have another piece of feedback there for you. Lee Rowan is L E I G H
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.120]   last name R O W A N. So two things I want to say,
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.440]   the first piece of feedback is that I would definitely transcribe all of your
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.760]   episodes and read them yourself in the beginning,
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.320]   especially and look for terms that you repeat a lot and try to
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.000]   trim those down. So for instance,
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.720]   as essential as the term is to the namesake of the
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.560]   podcast, all the hacks,
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:21.080]   I would suggest perhaps dialing down on the volume of using the word
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.000]   hack or hacks and thinking about it like a magazine article.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.440]   If that word came up over and over again, the editor would be like,
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.760]   here's thesaurus.com. Please come up with some other words.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.280]   So on the audio side, I think it's very similar.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.680]   And we all have these texts. We all have texts.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.240]   And I remember actually after the Ed Catmull episode, Oh, this is terrible.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:48.320]   I looked on social to see what type of feedback there might be.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.480]   And I saw many tweets with
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.960]   MMM dot, dot, dot, MMM, dot, dot, dot, MMM, dot, dot, dot.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.200]   You're driving me fucking crazy. And it turned out,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.640]   I was so nervous that every time he said something interesting about, Hmm, Hmm,
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   like some cave creature.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.600]   And it was just cringe worthy to listen to.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.400]   I had no awareness that I was doing it. And there are other words,
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.880]   pet phrases, et cetera, that in any given interview,
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.360]   I might repeat way too many times. So keep an eye out for that.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.800]   The other way that I used transcripts early on,
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.280]   and one of your questions for me has been,
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.120]   how have you honed your interviewing skills? Do you ask friends,
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.120]   mentors to listen to episodes and give feedback?
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.200]   Do you read, listen to your own episodes?
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.480]   Let me answer those specifically and then I'll come back to how I use the
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.800]   transcript. Do I read, listen to my own episodes? No, I don't.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.880]   I read the transcripts because it is more
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.840]   painfully obvious what you need to change.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.680]   You can get away with things in conversation that work and can work really
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.280]   well.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.840]   There is no one good style of interviewing or one great
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.920]   style of conversation. There are many,
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.480]   many ways to do this and many ways to play this game.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.760]   So I don't think it makes any sense for everyone to emulate one particular
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.280]   interviewer or style of interviewing. However,
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.120]   reading the transcript will make you
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:25.560]   acutely aware of any repetition, verbal tics,
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.280]   things like that.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.960]   So I do not listen to them unless I'm checking audio quality,
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.120]   which I used to do of course.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.720]   But these days I have a team to help with that. And by team, I need,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.440]   I mean a contracted post-production sound engineer.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.160]   I do not have,
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.360]   I have two full-time employees for everything that I do in my life.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.760]   Just to give people an idea of how small my team is.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.720]   Do I ask friends or mentors to listen? Sometimes I do,
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.960]   but in the beginning, if I did that,
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.880]   and this is true with asking friends for feedback
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.240]   on writing as well,
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.120]   I don't think it's very high yield, very helpful.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.040]   And certainly I think it's quite frustrating for the friends you're asking for
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.720]   advice. If you just say, give me feedback.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.120]   I don't think that's specific enough.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.840]   So in the case of writing what I would do and still do,
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.160]   if I'm writing a book, I split up chapters,
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.560]   which are intended to mostly be self-sufficient.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.800]   They're kind of modular in that way.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.680]   They're like feature magazine articles, the chapters.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:35.240]   And I will send say a single chapter to three or
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.080]   four friends.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.840]   Ideally they are writers or lawyers,
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.480]   or they've gone to law school. This is for writing,
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.120]   although it can apply to audio as well.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:53.240]   The reason for that is that both writers and people who have reviewed documents
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.840]   or learned to use a legal eye for reviewing
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.920]   text, have a keen eye for ambiguity.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.680]   They have a keen eye for anything superfluous that you just do not need that
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.400]   should be cut or can be cut. They have very,
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.560]   very sharp observation with respect to that.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.040]   So they make good proofreaders in my experience.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.880]   And I will say among other things, please read this.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.480]   And if anything is confusing, please note that
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:27.000]   you can love it. You can hate it. I'm fine with either of those,
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.080]   but if it's confusing, it's no good for anyone.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.480]   So if anything's confusing, please note, if your mind starts to wander,
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.040]   please note where that is.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.760]   If your mind starts to wander means it's dragging.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.800]   So I listened to a few of your episodes.
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.680]   There were a few points where I was going on a hike.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.720]   Like there were points when I was totally immersed in the audio.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.000]   And then there were points where I'm like a squirrel, trees, a bird,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.800]   a butterfly, which is fine because I'm on a hike.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.600]   But your intention I assume is to captivate me with the audio.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.640]   And there are points where my mind started to wander.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.440]   So you can ask someone to indicate, like if your mind starts to wander,
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.000]   indicate the time code,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.920]   make sure you use the same application for the time code,
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.000]   because it can vary from application to application.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.880]   So if you're using Overcast, use Overcast. If it's Pocket Cast, use Pocket Cast.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.400]   If it's Spotify, use Spotify, but have everyone use the same app. Okay.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.480]   In addition to that, I will say, if you could only keep 20%,
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   if I were going to cut 80% of this interview, which 20% should I keep?
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.200]   And would you cut it? Hold on one second. I'll get to that. Then conversely,
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.640]   and you don't have to use both of these, but I would say if I had to cut 20%,
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.520]   which 20% would I cut? I actually liked that question more,
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.960]   but I do ask both for different reasons, because if I give it to four people,
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.880]   if one person loves a section and three other people say, cut it, I will keep it.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.040]   If anyone loves something, I keep it. That's my rule.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.560]   But very often I wouldn't ask for feedback if I weren't
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.280]   planning on somehow using the feedback, if I found it valuable.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.800]   So the answer is yes, I very often make these cuts,
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:12.440]   but asking your friends to listen to audio and do this
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.800]   is really time consuming.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.280]   And it's actually very hard for them to specify things.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.360]   So what did I do with my transcripts?
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   One thing I did is I ended up reaching out and finding someone who did research
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.320]   and guest prep and everything for inside the actor studio.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.920]   And I asked them if they would be willing to read transcripts of some of my
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.960]   early episodes and to indicate where they thought I could improve what they
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.800]   think I should cut,
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.640]   where they think the sequence might be off in terms of questions.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.520]   And that's what we did.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.480]   I would send them word docs and they would add comments and red line and so on.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.480]   You could certainly use Google docs or something else.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.200]   I now use Google docs for this type of thing,
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:20:00.360]   but that is how I improved my interviewing.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:05.400]   And interviewing just as a, as an aside,
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.640]   but it's not really an aside.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.200]   This is sort of a core piece of the discussion is like anything else, right?
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.800]   It's like basketball, like what makes a good basketball player? Well,
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.160]   which position are they playing? What is the other team, right?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.080]   If they're boxers, like styles make fights, right? It's like, okay,
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:26.600]   just because a beats B and B beats C doesn't mean a is going to beat C.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.040]   It really depends on styles. And if you look at salespeople,
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.320]   what makes a good salesperson? Well, what are they selling?
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.040]   Some people are so charismatic and have this reality distortion field that people
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.040]   want to be friend them and they'll buy from them as a result of that.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.360]   Some people are super,
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.200]   super technical and kind of dispassionate in a way.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:49.680]   And others are really good at deal structure and figuring out conditional
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   purchase orders and kind of navigating the wants and needs of the other person
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:55.680]   and being very,
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.480]   very creative in how to structure a purchase, maybe finance a purchase, right?
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.000]   These are all different characteristics and different skill sets yet.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.080]   All of them could be exceptionally good salespeople.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.440]   The same thing is true in podcasting. You know,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.760]   if you want to grow your podcast,
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.200]   like turn yourself into a super hot woman and talk about blowjobs.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.160]   I've seen a few podcasts that have done that.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   I've seen a few podcasts that have done really well by doing that.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.200]   In addition to many other things that you have to get right.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.480]   That is sort of, it's not necessary, but not sufficient.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.520]   I wouldn't say it's necessary, but you can't do that. Chris, you could,
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.000]   I don't know. Maybe you'd find a market for it,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.040]   but that's not going to work for you.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:46.680]   If I tried to be Joe Rogan with his knack and talent and developed skill for
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.440]   comedy, it would fall flat. I'm not going to try to be Joe Rogan.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.960]   James Lipton,
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   when he ran inside the actor's studio never deviated from his questions.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.560]   He had his list of questions.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:06.040]   They were stacked in order on these blue cards and he would never deviate.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.360]   Even if there was a side door to a topic that could be more interesting,
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.560]   he would not take that side door.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.440]   Now some people might judge that harshly and say, well, that's stupid.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.440]   You should have taken the side door. Well, does anyone know your podcast?
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.360]   A lot of people know inside the actor's studio seems to have worked pretty well.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.760]   Maybe that format was exactly what he needed.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.600]   Then you have folks who come in with meticulous notes.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.720]   I come in with lots and lots and lots and lots of notes that works for me.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.080]   Larry King came in blind. Larry King,
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.080]   who also one could say was early to the radio game in the same way that some
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.480]   people were early to the podcast game.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.960]   So you have to take that into consideration and maybe discount things a little
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.160]   bit,
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:56.160]   but he would come in with beginner's eyes to ask the naive questions that a
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.960]   listener might want to ask.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.280]   He didn't want to know more than the listener or the viewer.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:09.160]   So this is all to say becoming a better interviewer is really becoming your best
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.360]   self as an interviewer.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.080]   But no matter what reviewing transcripts for me is a core piece of that and
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.120]   collecting questions.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.000]   I remember I would effectively have not a three ring binder,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.240]   but a collection of questions. I would take photographs of my phone pre COVID.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.680]   Certainly if you're taking flights,
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:33.480]   it'd be the only time that I read magazines and you look at these in-flight
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.160]   magazines, there are always interviews. And if I found a good question,
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.440]   I would take a photograph and I would test it.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.480]   If I listened to a podcast and I heard a good question,
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.720]   I would note it.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.200]   I've been interviewing people for hiring for a new position recently.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.520]   And someone I was interviewing, I solicited questions and they said,
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.120]   how do you give feedback?
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.120]   Could you give me a few examples of when people have disappointed you and how
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.520]   you've handled that? And I thought to myself, Holy shit, that's a good question.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   I might steal that one. So be a collector and a tester of questions.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.840]   Also.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.360]   So I have a bunch, I'm like going back to my man.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.880]   I have a bunch of follow-ups here. Yeah, let's do it.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.240]   Backing up to the prep. How long are you spending?
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.160]   Let's go back to if you were doing this all on your own, preparing for,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.080]   for an interview.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:32.320]   It depends on the interview, but I would say generally minimum a few hours.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.320]   So let's just call it minimum two to four hours.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.600]   And I have some approaches for that that I can share and
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.520]   maximum for instance,
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.680]   if there is a possible big break interview.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.040]   And one of those for me was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.680]   When that finally came together,
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:58.720]   I spent probably four or five days digesting everything about Arnold
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.240]   Schwarzenegger in watching interviews, watching movies, reading books,
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.520]   going through every past interview I could find.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.240]   I wanted to be the best prepared interviewer
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:16.400]   he had ever met basically. And therefore I took it very, very seriously.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.880]   But if we're talking about on the
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.720]   average side, let's just assume that's three to four hours.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.880]   Now I spend less time because I have help and I have
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.280]   cultivated a system and also improved the system with the input of team
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.080]   members, how to prepare research documents.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.640]   I would say two to four hours.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.560]   I will also ask guests to send their favorite
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.600]   two to three long form interviews.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.640]   I will ask them and not all guests are keen to do this,
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.680]   but some are very keen for exploratory
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.240]   topics or questions that they think could be fun
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:08.160]   for us and the audience and anything else that they would like to send.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.240]   So I opened that door and all of those things are received typically weeks
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.200]   or months in advance because the editorial calendar is built out quite far in
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.800]   advance. At least these days it is.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.560]   If you're doing prep from scratch,
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.840]   if the person has a Wikipedia page,
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.320]   I look for the strangest or most esoteric slash tiny
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.240]   unusual mention in Wikipedia. And I do a deep dive on that point.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.280]   And I go into these citations.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.400]   I will certainly look at social.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.360]   This is important because for instance,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.560]   in between the time that you book a guest and you record,
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.400]   they could have a family member die. They could have any number of things happen.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.320]   They could have some type of disaster in the press.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.880]   You want to be aware of what is going on.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.760]   So I don't spend a lot of time on social,
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.600]   but I will check in and go back at least a month or
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.520]   two to ensure that I have a basic understanding of what is on their minds and
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.440]   hearts. That doesn't take very long. I would say that's less than less than 30
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.520]   minutes. So you have Wikipedia and then long form interviews.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.480]   So I will look at print. I will start print, meaning text,
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.200]   long form text interviews.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.800]   I will look at the interviews that they've sent.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.960]   And that helps me in a number of different ways.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.320]   It shows me where they're good.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.640]   It shows me where they stall out or don't have answers.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.800]   It also helps me to gather what I consider
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.360]   greatest hits stories.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.840]   And here's what I mean by that.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.320]   We all have stories that we have told more than once,
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:02.120]   just like comedians who have worked on their material and refined over and over
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.360]   again, that 60 minutes special.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.480]   We all have stories that over time we have determined
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.680]   get a great response.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:18.880]   And I want to know what those are. And sometimes I'll ask them point blank.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.840]   Either in prep or while we're doing the warmup in the beginning, I'll say,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.880]   "Hey, is there a story that I can cue? I don't want to hear the story now,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.560]   but a story that's really funny or that always gets a response from audiences.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.440]   Maybe you've done a lot of speaking engagements.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.200]   It's something that people always come up to you and mention.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.520]   Is there any story or anecdote or metaphor?
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.280]   It could be anything, parable that comes to mind." And oftentimes they'll say,
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   "Let me think about that. Yeah, there is. Okay. Ask me about the time that X,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.960]   ask me about when I was in college and why it happened." Great.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.240]   I will plant one of those greatest hits stories within the first 10 minutes
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.800]   if I have one of those to pull people in and
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.640]   hopefully pass the driveway test,
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.840]   as I heard someone from NPR put it, which is,
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.600]   and this happens with podcasts too,
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.080]   when you're listening to it in the car and you've got 10 or 20 minutes left and
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.280]   you get home and you just have to finish it.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.360]   So you stay in the car in the driveway and you listen to the end.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.000]   I think it's helpful to plan that through.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.160]   So those are a few of the ways that I do research.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:32.880]   If we have any common friends
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:39.080]   or acquaintances, I will also ask them for topics and questions
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:44.000]   they think might be fun or that might take us
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.120]   on the road less traveled. And I used to do this more than I do now,
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.960]   but I will sometimes post it to social and ask what types of questions
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.480]   people would love me to ask.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:58.320]   Given the size of my audience on social now,
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.200]   that makes less and less sense because it's very hard to filter,
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.880]   very hard to gather them. I will sometimes do that, but not terribly often.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.160]   Have you ever done so much research that you kind of
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.200]   knew the entire conversation you would have in advance because you'd learned,
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.600]   you know, you'd read someone's book, you learned all this information.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.480]   It's like coming in Arnold Schwarzenegger so prepared, you know,
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.680]   there were probably things that you wanted to talk about that you knew the
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.040]   answers to, but how did that go?
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.680]   Because now it's not as engaging because you know the answers.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.280]   Yeah. I will always leave lots of virgin territory.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.000]   So I will have some familiarity, not with all guests,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.440]   but some with greatest hit stories. So I'll plant a few of those,
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.440]   but generally speaking, my interviews are going to be at least 90 minutes.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.640]   That will be maximum five to 20 minutes of the conversation.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:56.800]   There may also be things that they've talked about,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.720]   but there's some aspect that was left out and I'll ask about that.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:05.280]   So my rule or one of the fundamental
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:10.880]   precepts of how I approach podcasting is if it's
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.600]   interesting to you, it will be interesting to other people.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.760]   You can't fucking fake it. People can smell it out.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.240]   It's like dogs can smell fear.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:24.440]   Audiences know when you are stoked and audiences know when you're faking it.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.760]   So you got to make the interviews interesting for yourself.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:33.280]   Even if it gets into some really strange topics that are going to appeal to a
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.040]   very small percentage of your audience, doesn't matter. You got to include it.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.080]   And you can always cut it out later,
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.040]   but you got to make it interesting for yourself. So in the case of Schwarzenegger,
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:44.920]   yes,
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.360]   I had consumed vast quantities of interviews
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   and footage and commentary and so on related to
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.720]   Arnold, but he has decades of
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.200]   time on this planet and there is a lot that is not covered.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:09.480]   So it was easy for me to weave in questions that would take us
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:14.840]   to unexplored areas. That was very, very easy. I'll also say,
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.160]   do not get too attached to your research
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.880]   in the sense that 90 minutes goes very, very quickly. I mean,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.480]   we've been recording for more than 90 minutes now, 90 minutes goes very quickly.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.200]   So if you have tons of research in front of you,
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:39.320]   pick the five to seven questions you most want to get
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.720]   answered. That is for 90 minutes.
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:47.640]   Keep in mind because I want the freedom and the slack to explore
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.480]   side doors.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.600]   And we may end up scrapping all the research that I've done and save it for a
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.320]   round two, which is something I do quite a lot.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.560]   And then I'll circle the things that we didn't get to with a highlighter and put
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.200]   R2 on them, take photographs,
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.360]   put it into Evernote and I share that with my team. And I'm like,
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.640]   this is what we'll use for a round two.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.720]   Don't be attached to finishing all of your questions.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:12.880]   And very often what I will do to try to limit the impulse to
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:17.520]   do that is I will block an interview into sections.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.200]   I don't do this always, but sometimes to let a guest know what is coming,
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.080]   I will say for the first 30 minutes, we're going to bounce all over the place.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.200]   It's going to be background, personal story, et cetera.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:34.400]   And I always ask them for specifics and
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.280]   examples, high concept, abstract stuff,
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.080]   bores the shit out of audiences and bores the shit out of me.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.320]   There can be some high concept stuff, but we need real examples,
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.040]   real details and so on. If someone's not willing to do that, by the way,
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.200]   I will sometimes not publish the audio. So if they don't bring their A game,
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.080]   if they're not playing to win and really doing the prep,
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.480]   I don't feel obligated to publish. That happens very rarely,
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.160]   but I'd say about around a dozen interviews I haven't published.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.880]   Like if they're not actually trying,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.760]   if they're not attempting to do what will appeal to the audience,
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.160]   I'm not going to publish.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.080]   Are you direct with them and you're telling them why you didn't publish?
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.200]   Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Yeah.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.280]   Sometimes you just lose, lose the audio.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.240]   Yeah, exactly. I mean,
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:24.360]   I wish I could tell you that I'm always a hundred percent honest about that,
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.320]   but sometimes, especially in the early days,
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.000]   I was not confident or comfortable enough to do that.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.640]   So there was a lot of audio that just vanished into the cloud.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.760]   Hard to explain, but it happens.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.480]   And sometimes there would be a make good on that.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.480]   So let's say they have an excellent book,
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.800]   but the interview was just terrible.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:51.160]   Then I might offer to take an excerpt from the book from a particularly good
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.120]   chapter, put it on the blog,
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.400]   and then use that as a way to assist in some fashion.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.440]   One of the questions that you had and don't lose track of your follow-up
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.240]   questions, but one of the questions you had is, do I read the books these days?
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.920]   No. And in fact, I get sent and have been sent.
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.520]   There was a point where I was getting sent 50 plus books a week from
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.080]   publishers, by the way, never signed up for these lists, never asked for them.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.040]   So if any publishers are listening, please take me off your list.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.720]   Cause I I'm going to start putting specific names on the sort of public hall of
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.680]   shame for spamming me with physical books.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.080]   You're killing trees.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.160]   You're causing the decline of our earth unnecessarily
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.880]   with books that I'm just going to give away. Stop it. Stop it. Stop doing it.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.840]   Take me off your lists.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:46.080]   But the point is I was getting 50 plus books a week and that's just untenable.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.560]   I can't even the books from friends or acquaintances.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.360]   If you consider the hundreds of people I've had on the podcast and the many
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.400]   people that I know, and I've met over the years,
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.080]   it's physically impossible for me to read these books and I don't want to have to
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:02.040]   pick and choose. So I actually put up,
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.880]   people can see it at Tim dot blog slash new books.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.200]   It is the one decision that removes a thousand decisions.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.640]   There's a blog post about that.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.800]   And one of the policies is I will not read the books beforehand.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.720]   I'm only reading old books,
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.960]   meaning books that have not been published in this year. So I don't do that.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.760]   However,
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.800]   you can ask the publicist or the author to send
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.440]   you some high level concepts or a one or two
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.720]   page, or if they're using that for interviews and so on,
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.000]   you can have them do that. But I do not read books in advance.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.560]   There have been cases where I've read the book in preparation,
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.400]   like in Arnold Schwarzenegger's case,
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   or if the authors are authors I followed for a long time,
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.240]   like Walter Isaacson, for instance,
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.480]   who's written incredible biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Da Vinci and so
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.800]   on, then I will read the books, but it's quite rare,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.200]   especially in the last two years. But in the beginning, yes, look,
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.480]   you got to earn
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:10.400]   the quality of the output in your interviews.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.080]   And if reading is going to help, then do it. Because in the beginning,
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.160]   you're not going to be getting sent 50 books a week.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.480]   You may have slack in the system to do that.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.440]   But other questions or topics.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.720]   In the beginning, did you ever, as I've even found myself,
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.800]   as your interview skills get better and better, it's easier and easier.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.080]   But in the beginning, did you ever just take a pause in an interview and say,
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.960]   let me just take a minute to really like regroup and replan where this is going
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.120]   to go. Maybe you don't tell them exactly why,
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.560]   but what kind of things might we have found on the chopping floor?
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.400]   I will always tell people in advance that
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.800]   they should feel free to take a water break or a bathroom break,
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.880]   and that they can also restate anything.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:57.000]   So if they get two sentences into a story and they're like, ah,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.160]   this isn't that good. I want to start over. They can just say that, you know,
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.440]   let me just start that over, take two seconds of silence, start over.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.040]   Then we can clean it up. That also gives me the ability. And I'll say this,
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.560]   I may need a water break or a bathroom break. That gives me the ability.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:13.760]   If I need a breather, water, bathroom,
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.560]   or just to clear my head and figure out where's this going,
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.400]   where do I want to take this? Then I'll do that.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:24.240]   But my episodes are generally speaking,
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.560]   minimally edited, very minimally edited.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.040]   Although the number of ticks will determine how much editing it
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.160]   is incredible. How many smart people have atrocious
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.480]   verbal texts. They will say, like, like, like, like, like,
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.600]   literally a hundred plus times in a 90 minute interview.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.000]   I do not exaggerate, or someone will say, you know, you know what I'm saying?
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.520]   Which is actually a very, I've noticed some gender patterns.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.040]   I know it's very unfashionable to talk about such things,
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.720]   but men, the, you know, you know,
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.000]   tends to be more of a male thing across the board and
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.120]   like a lot of men say like,
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.680]   but it's especially noticeable for a lot of women, a lot of female guests.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.760]   It's kind of interesting that the ticks seem to skew in,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.440]   in different genders and different directions. So, so dot, dot, dot, so dot,
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:30.840]   dot, um, uh, uh, those are all very common.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.280]   There was one guest. I'm not going to name him by name,
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:38.400]   although I think he'd find it funny. He said, uh, he had a really good one. He,
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.800]   he said, and whatnot, and he'd be like, da, da, da, da, da, and whatnot,
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.320]   and whatnot. And he said it so often. And at the time,
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.040]   I just didn't want to deal with having to edit it.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.800]   So I left it in and he went into the office the day after the
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.280]   podcast had come out and all his coworkers started calling him Mr.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.100]   Whatnot.
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:05.040]   And you will absolutely notice that.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.680]   So I want my guests to sound as good as possible. If they're nervous,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.640]   I will tell them that like my job is to make you sound as good as possible.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.440]   If you're nervous, put that on me.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.760]   It is my responsibility as the interviewer to direct and
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:25.200]   shape and prompt in the best way possible. Just be yourself,
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.680]   take any nerves and just put it on me. It's all on me.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.680]   So I will also say that if people are nervous, so that'd be a good example.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.880]   Uh, dot, dot, dot. If you do it once or twice, it's fine and you can leave it in.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.480]   But if you hear that at the beginning of every answer, then it's a problem.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.520]   Another tick would be, that's a good question. That's a good question. Oh,
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.000]   that's a good question. That's a great question. Oh, that's a good question.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.040]   You might hear that literally 20 times in one interview.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.560]   You got to clip that. They just won't sound
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.640]   as good as they should otherwise. And that's part of your responsibility.
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.920]   But if you're just getting started,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.640]   there's a product that I've used called Descript or Descript.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.160]   I don't know exactly. Yeah.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   And it makes it really easy to find these filler words.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.640]   I still find it needs some tweaking around the edges cause they're not perfect,
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.320]   but it's a great tool for like running through a transcript that's auto
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.880]   generated, but certainly cheaper than if you were paying someone to, you know,
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.320]   word for word, transcribe everything.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.440]   Absolutely.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:33.200]   And looking at another question that you sent me because to lay out how this
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.840]   podcast came to be, you sent me a bunch of very good questions via email,
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.160]   which I requested after we had an initial conversation. And one of them,
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:48.040]   which I then asked to answer in this format so I could point people to it is you
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000]   seem to understand your audience. Well, how did you build that understanding?
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.120]   Did you survey them, ask for email feedback or something else? Okay.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.760]   I'll give you the tactical answer.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.680]   And then I'm going to give you the principle behind most of my thinking.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.880]   I have surveyed my audience,
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.200]   but I haven't done that at length in many, many years.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:12.240]   The reason I surveyed my audience also was to gather demographic data,
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.800]   average household income,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.760]   and many other things so that I could present that to sponsors.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.600]   Because at the time I had dozens of sponsors coming in and I could not answer
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.440]   those questions.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.600]   Now with Facebook analytics,
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.520]   assuming you are present on multiple platforms or your podcast is present on
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.360]   multiple platforms,
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.760]   you have many different ways that you can gather this data now.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.360]   Facebook would be one. There are many other options. I did survey,
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:44.480]   but I would say the way I've gotten to know my audience is,
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.840]   this is going to be very unsatisfying answer. Fortunately,
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.880]   I think there's a satisfying principle that comes after it is over more than a
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.080]   decade since four hour work week came out in 2007. I started the blog,
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.640]   I want to say in 2005 or 2006,
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:05.440]   I have been growing and learning alongside my audience for 13 plus years now.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.840]   And you really get to know your audience and your audience will change over
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:19.400]   time. So since launching the podcast, I would say my audience,
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:24.120]   my readership was 80/20,
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.240]   80% male, 20% female. Let's just keep it simple.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.320]   I know that gender is a sensitive topic and there are more options,
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.640]   but let's just keep it basic for now.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.400]   I would say as of a few years ago,
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.000]   it's more 60/40 female, male,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.960]   and I have changed over time somewhat. Blog, social,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.800]   blog, meaning blog comments, social media feedback.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.400]   These are all things that I pay some attention to,
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:59.480]   but that can quickly get overwhelming.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:04.880]   So I would suggest that people listen to what I say,
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.480]   listen to, I'll give you the upshot in a moment,
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.800]   but listen to my interview with Tim Urban,
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.040]   who has an incredible blog called Wait But Why.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:20.000]   And if he had followed any of the advice for how to create a popular blog,
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.400]   by the way, he would not have done what he did. I mean,
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.200]   some of his pieces I want to say are 30,000, 50,000 words. I mean,
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.040]   they're books.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:32.200]   Some of his multi-part blog posts are effectively books. They're long.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.000]   Not all of them are long. One of my favorites is the tail end.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.200]   It's not germane to what we're talking about with the tail end,
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.280]   just search the tail end by Tim Urban. Everyone should read it.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:44.320]   It will improve your life. It will improve how you relate to your family.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.960]   It's a must read. It'll take you 10 minutes, but he has talked,
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:53.640]   and I think he also talked about this in Tribe Mentors about writing for his
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:57.840]   audience. And he said, it's really easy. And I'm paraphrasing here,
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.240]   but basically he imagines a huge stadium and
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.200]   each seat is filled by another Tim Urban.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.560]   So an entire stadium filled of himself.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.560]   And he is just writing what he would want to read.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.720]   And it sounds so simplistic.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:22.800]   It sounds almost ridiculous.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.720]   And if it is incredibly simplistic,
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.600]   it is incredibly effective as well.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:36.000]   So if you know yourself and you pay attention to what excites you,
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.680]   you pay attention to your fears, you pay attention to the goals that you have,
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.560]   you pay attention to the things that you struggle with,
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.680]   even though you've tried to fix them before you pay attention to the things that
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.480]   bother you, you at least have a guaranteed market of one.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.680]   A lot of people fuck that up. They start speculating and, you know,
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.560]   they're like a 22 year old guy. And they're like, you know what?
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.440]   I went to Wharton and I figured out doing all of these financial models and
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.320]   management consulting.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.280]   There's this huge opportunity for new moms who need blah,
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.280]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah for their kids. And, you know,
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.600]   regenerative blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.080]   They don't know anything about any of these things,
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.280]   but they've identified a huge market opportunity.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:20.400]   And that is where they're going to focus their energies for building a company
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:21.680]   that can work.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.600]   I'm not saying it can't work in terms of good financial outcomes.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:27.800]   Are they going to have a lot of fun doing it? Probably not.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.000]   In the world of podcasting, in the world of writing,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.760]   don't assume you are somewhat of superhuman empathy
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.560]   and that you can guess what other people need. Just focus on yourself.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:47.560]   And the personal will end up being the most universal. If that makes sense.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.640]   I'll give you an example. This might screw up the audio for a second,
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:55.320]   but I'm holding up an AirPods case. All right.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:58.160]   Now who else has an AirPods case? My girlfriend.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.600]   And we mix up cases all the time.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:07.440]   And it's a huge pain in the ass because sometimes I'll pick up what I think are
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.280]   mine.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.960]   They're hers and the earbuds aren't even in the case.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:13.920]   They're upstairs somewhere.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.480]   And then I get to a coffee shop where I'm supposed to work or do something.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.640]   And I can't take a phone call.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.040]   And this problem has repeated itself over and over and over again.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.480]   I tried to say,
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.880]   use a Sharpie to write a name on the outside.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.240]   Anyone who has tried that knows that it immediately gets rubbed off.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.120]   It doesn't work.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.360]   So the solution that I figured out is you open the case and you
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.640]   just put your initials inside the divots at the very top.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:44.720]   So you can see T there at the top never gets worn off works every time.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.640]   And we have not mixed up our AirPods sets.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.120]   This is the first time I'm talking about that,
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.560]   but I suspect I'm not the only person who has had this problem.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:57.920]   There is a piece of blue masking tape on my wife's AirPods case,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.760]   which does not fall off like marker. Yeah. So you could do that as well.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.000]   You could use masking tape. I mean, there, there are multiple solutions here.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.600]   This is the one that worked for us. Great. Where to next?
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.280]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.520]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs codes,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.760]   deals, and discounts from our partners.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.040]   You can go to all the hacks.com/deals.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.480]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.280]   So the audience thing is interesting.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.600]   I know you're someone who likes stats and analyzing the data.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:39.400]   There is some interesting data that I'm not sure if it even makes sense to do
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.240]   anything with. So you've got your downloads per episode.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.760]   You've got these charts that Apple and Spotify give you of like,
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.080]   where do people drop off in a episode? Do you look at that data?
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.200]   Do you do anything with it? Do you completely ignore it?
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.600]   I do pay attention to downloads, not a lot of attention.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:00.520]   I haven't looked at my stats in weeks,
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.600]   but if an episode does unusually well,
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.720]   if it's several standard deviations, say away from other episodes,
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.440]   and there isn't an easy explanation for it. So if I have,
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:16.440]   LeBron James on the podcast as an example, which I did,
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.000]   then if that episode is a runaway hit,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.240]   I'm not going to be that surprised because some of what was featured in the
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.600]   episode is picked up by ESPN and different comments are quoted all over the
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.720]   place. So there's a lot of carry,
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.520]   but if there's an outlier that isn't easily explained,
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.280]   then I want to take a close look at that.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:42.160]   If there's an under performer that isn't easily explained,
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.520]   I also want to take a close look at that.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.920]   Determining any causality whatsoever is really difficult
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:53.440]   unless there's a technical problem. So very often,
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.040]   if there is an under performer,
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.200]   the first thing that we look for are technical problems.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.720]   Was there an issue with any of the major platforms?
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.960]   And that is important to keep an eye on.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:11.360]   But I have not found the vast majority of data
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.680]   that is easy to collect or to find to be that actionable.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.960]   But I'd be curious to hear your perspective because things have changed and the
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:19.960]   tools have become better,
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:24.880]   but still I think it is tempting to
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:30.400]   conclude causality with say an N of one with one episode
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.520]   that does something strange.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.480]   And it's very,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:37.320]   very hard with any conviction for me to say that that's going to be an
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.160]   accurate read.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:43.920]   I have not found anything super effective to use with kind of the
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.240]   standard platform analytics. Every now and then I'm like, wow,
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.480]   that episode did a little better.
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:51.840]   I haven't seen any major order of magnitude changes. You know,
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.920]   there's been this one's 10% up, 10% down.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:58.480]   I kind of attribute that to all kinds of randomness. Yeah.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:02.680]   The one thing that I will say, maybe this falls under analytics and it's a,
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.080]   another tip from Kevin Rose was Chartable is a
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.080]   platform that you can use for lots of analytics things.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.080]   But the one thing they do,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.600]   that's really cool is if you put their prefix in front of your feed,
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.080]   which means every episode just gets hosted on a platform,
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.320]   you can tell your hosting platform, Hey,
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:27.320]   make sure the URL include this other thing also so that someone else sees
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:32.160]   whenever that's requested. And so you can create a link. So, you know,
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:34.840]   if this were on my show, it'd be link.chartable.com/athtim.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:40.600]   And then Chartable will say what IP address went to the link
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:46.800]   and then look for whether that IP address actually requested an episode.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.240]   And so you can go and say, here's a link to promote an episode.
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.760]   You can put it on different social channels.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.880]   You could give it to a guest if they want to promote it.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.960]   And you could see which channels are actually converting to downloads,
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:03.440]   which I think is something that it's always easy to see who clicked what,
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.160]   but did they actually listen to the episode?
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.560]   Now you can't find out how many minutes they listened to or anything like that,
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.080]   but it's at least one piece of evidence to support what to do.
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:16.320]   And I used it to make a decision, which was interesting.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.240]   When you are promoting an episode, you basically have two choices.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.840]   You can send a link to every platform out there, which some people do.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.560]   They go on Twitter and they're like, check out my new episode here.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.520]   It is on iTunes and here it is on Google. And here it is on Spotify.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:33.600]   And here it is here, here, here, or you can link to a site,
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.080]   like your own website where it's click here.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.200]   And now there's like seven player buttons where the individual listener could
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:42.680]   jump off to, or Chartable will let you say,
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.320]   if someone opens on an iPhone, just directly take them to the podcast app,
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.320]   which is great. If they use that,
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:51.120]   it's probably a terrible experience if they're a Spotify or an overcast
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.920]   listener. So I actually tested out one episode. I did one way,
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.800]   one I did the other way when I did the next way.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:59.520]   And I just looked at which one of those links converted better.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.400]   And the best conversion was sending them to my website with the player
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:08.480]   links on it, then trying to guess or listing multiple things.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:14.760]   What success is depends on how you define success and what metrics
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:19.960]   constitute success for you. So one could be increasing downloads.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:26.440]   Another could be increasing plays,
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:27.920]   which is a lot trickier,
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:33.040]   although different platforms count downloads
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.040]   and plays differently.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:39.080]   So you might have automatic downloads in the background
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:42.560]   on Apple things may have changed, but at least a few years ago,
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.640]   that was the case. And that would count as a download,
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.000]   even if it were never touched,
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.560]   never seen by the person who owns that iPhone versus say on Spotify,
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:52.360]   if someone clicks play that counts,
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:55.400]   and then people might look at their analytics and conclude, Oh,
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:00.360]   Spotify is only 5% of my downloads and quotation marks.
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:04.520]   Therefore I really don't need to pay attention to it. Whereas in reality,
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:08.240]   maybe it's 20 or 30% or more of your actual plays.
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:11.960]   So it's important to understand the limitations and the
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.640]   mechanics of some of these platforms.
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.360]   I would also say an additional benefit of sending people to your website is that
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.720]   you can offer or incentivize
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:29.400]   them to sign up for something like a newsletter, because as it stands,
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.960]   if you are publishing through an RSS feed in the way that most people do,
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:39.040]   you do not have a direct relationship, or I should say,
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:44.040]   you don't have the ability to communicate effectively directly with the people
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.200]   who listen to your podcast.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:50.200]   And I view that as a problem in the same way that I view any business based on a
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:53.720]   single platform as highly vulnerable.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.240]   I remember talking to somebody who had, it was, it was a semi, I don't know,
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:03.240]   $10 million a year business built on a Facebook page of some type Facebook
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:08.640]   pages. And I, and I asked them how that was going for them. And they said, well,
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.560]   it's going great,
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.600]   but it feels like I have the most profitable McDonald's in the world built on
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.120]   top of an active volcano.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.960]   Any moment at any moment, the algorithm could be changed suddenly.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.640]   Oh, you're a business page. Okay.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:30.000]   Now we're going to throttle your organic reach to like 10% of your audience.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.120]   And you're going to have to pay to reach the people you thought or guaranteed to
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.760]   see your message. I don't like that. I don't like that risk.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:40.440]   And therefore for me,
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:45.440]   at least one of the core drivers for using the newsletter,
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.160]   as I have, you know, five bullet Fridays is the most popular aspect of the
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.680]   newsletter, which is free. So listeners,
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.520]   you can find that at Tim dot blog slash Friday.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:02.040]   I've been doing that for a long time now is to establish a direct line of
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:08.640]   communication with my listeners and readers. And quite frankly,
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.400]   also because text is my native language,
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.400]   everything started with books. And so in the same way that Rogan is really,
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:21.600]   really, really good on video, it's also quite clever via text. I mean,
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:22.680]   I think his, his, there,
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:26.760]   there are many good reasons why he is incredibly popular on Instagram. I mean,
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:30.640]   some of his, some of his captions and so on are exceptional and they're long.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.360]   Some of them, for me, that translates to feeling very comfortable,
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.480]   very competent, very good about the newsletter.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.320]   Writing five bullet Friday is therapeutic for me.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:47.560]   So it is in a way a diary and self therapy and quote,
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:51.560]   unquote marketing all in one, which is great.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.560]   So those are a few thoughts,
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.880]   but I don't pay a lot of attention to data,
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.840]   but I will look at trend lines over time.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.520]   And if there's some type of catalyzing event or concern,
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:09.240]   especially due to technical problems or new policies on platforms,
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:12.440]   then I'll take a quick look at that. But the fact of the matter is,
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.880]   I wouldn't pay too much attention to data or specific data sets until you've
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.080]   asked yourself,
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:23.520]   what action will I take or not take,
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.000]   or what behavioral will change based on looking at this data set.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.960]   And if the answer is none and none do something else,
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.720]   unless you're just,
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:37.800]   it nurtures your soul and kind of tickles your nuts to
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.960]   chew on data. If that's just your fun, that's your recreation. Great.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.080]   Have fun. But otherwise I wouldn't pay too much attention to it.
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.320]   So one of the most common things I think people look at data for,
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.960]   and it's not clear, like you said,
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:56.720]   that they would do anything about it is to try to see if their audience is
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:59.360]   growing. Yep. So I know you said, don't think about growth,
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.480]   but we can come back to growth.
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.440]   I think one of the interesting things is a lot of people have podcasts,
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.920]   good content. And, you know,
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.160]   I've been asked to go on some podcasts where they get a hundred,
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:15.080]   200 downloads an episode, and they're just not breaking out,
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.600]   but it's not because they don't have good content.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.680]   You obviously came into this.
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:20.880]   I remember you said that when you launched your podcast,
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.160]   it was the number one podcast in iTunes. Yep.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.720]   I know you get a boost when you launch, but not everyone has that.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.440]   Do you think other than good content is growth,
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.840]   something you think people should spend any time on because people have to find
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.200]   that good content? Sure. I think growth,
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:43.920]   I think awareness is perfectly valid to
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.080]   focus on. And I do pay attention to growth.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.560]   I do track,
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:54.360]   I'm very well aware of like the average number of downloads at week two at week
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.920]   six per episode and total number of downloads.
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.600]   And I do pay attention to a handful of key metrics.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.920]   I just don't,
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:09.040]   I don't pay attention to them to the extent that they become a
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:12.360]   distraction from things that I think are more important.
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:15.800]   But in the beginning for sure, I launched, like I said,
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:19.640]   2014 and the ecosystem has exploded since
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:24.000]   competition is, I mean, probably a million X, what it was. I mean,
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.200]   at least a few thousand X, what it was. Although I would say just,
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.440]   just because there are a lot of podcasts doesn't mean automatically that you
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:34.480]   have competition competition for what,
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:38.400]   what is the scarce resource that you are competing for? If not,
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:41.720]   why is it a competition? It's an ego thing. What is the competition?
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:45.440]   I think these are questions worth asking, but let's come back to growth.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.040]   So when I launched in 2014, I should also say,
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:52.880]   there were people who said to me that ship has sailed.
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:57.920]   It's too late. There's no point doing a podcast in 2014.
[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:01.880]   So I think they were wrong then.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:05.240]   And the people who say that now, I also think are wrong.
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:10.360]   It's still very, very early. Think about it. I mean,
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:15.400]   Amazon has only come into this space in a big way, very recently,
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:19.800]   and they're very quietly, I suspect doing lots of interesting things,
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.040]   but they have not thrown all their weight behind this.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.840]   And they have a lot of weight to throw. That is just one example.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.160]   We are so early still, I think,
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.880]   but with respect to what has helped
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:38.120]   increase downloads,
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:42.760]   I would say being on other podcasts,
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:47.240]   first and foremost, helped drive subscribers.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.960]   You need to be explicit about asking people to go to the podcast and being
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:55.200]   explicit with the host that that is why you are coming on the podcast.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.160]   Otherwise, I don't think there's automatically a high conversion rate.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.960]   People who listen to podcasts probably listen to more than one podcast.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:09.440]   So I do think that there is a fair amount of transference when you're on other
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:14.160]   podcasts and it makes you a better podcaster to be on other well-run
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.000]   podcasts. So you can take notes on process, how they prep you,
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.480]   what technology they use,
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.840]   what did they do or not do that you could adapt or not adapt?
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.000]   What are you doing that you might want to discard?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.640]   So there is an educational part also to being on other podcasts that you might
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.080]   not get from pursuing growth through other channels.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:38.160]   I think that newsletters are also very powerful.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.360]   Email and newsletters,
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:44.120]   they're powerful for everything because they are one link click
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.320]   away from whatever the desired action is.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:50.400]   So those would be two that come to mind.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.200]   And there are other ways to increase
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:00.680]   downloads and subscribers. Certainly big names don't hurt,
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:04.040]   but it's one thing to get somebody to your podcast.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:08.280]   It's another to have them stick around and be an active listener.
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.400]   So if you get a celebrity on and they are
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.160]   mediocre at best, is someone going to listen to a second episode?
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.480]   I would guess not. They might have an automatic download,
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.080]   but what is it that you actually care about?
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:24.920]   The download number or the number of active listeners?
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.200]   I care about the number of active listeners for a lot of reasons.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.960]   Hard to confirm what the active listenership is,
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:33.640]   but big names definitely help, right?
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.920]   The Arnold Schwarzenegger episode and the amount of promotion that I then did
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.800]   behind it, right? So I do use paid acquisition,
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:43.880]   advertising, things of this type,
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.200]   having a name to really put
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.960]   a lot of the machine behind and muscle behind,
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.760]   which could be as simple as a basic campaign on your
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:59.040]   platform of choice.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.760]   That doesn't necessitate having a blog and so on like I do.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:05.200]   I think that is certainly helpful,
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.280]   but it's a temptation that needs to be tempered because you could spend all your
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.200]   time chasing big names. And I think it's a fool's errand, as I mentioned earlier,
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:15.400]   certainly video.
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:20.560]   I think YouTube TikTok to some extent, certainly,
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.040]   although I think Andrew Chen has written some very interesting pieces about
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.800]   TikTok and its effects on virality and some perhaps unintended or unknown
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.520]   consequences of sudden influx. So people can, can Google that and find it.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:39.400]   YouTube can be extremely helpful. And I've seen that with many podcasts.
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.280]   Now it's, it's not just limited to Joe Rogan.
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:46.440]   You have many examples. I mean, Jordan Peterson would be another example.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:49.120]   There are probably thousands of examples,
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.320]   but I could certainly think of a dozen offhand who use video very, very well.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.240]   Those are a few and PR, PR.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:02.560]   If you want to practice your chops with getting out in other types of media
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.200]   outside of podcasting, then knock yourself out.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.280]   You could do that as well.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.120]   When you said video,
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:13.600]   I noticed you have two kinds of podcast videos on your YouTube channel.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:18.480]   You've got the static image of the cover art and the guest and just
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:23.200]   playing the audio. And then the actual interview are both of those
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.920]   effective, or do you really think the real boost comes when you have video
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:28.760]   content?
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.440]   The real boost comes from video content for sure. Yeah.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:35.840]   The static images are placeholders from audio only interviews.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.040]   Yeah. So to put them on YouTube,
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:43.520]   we choose a cover page of some type and that is what people
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:46.880]   see, but for sure, actual video,
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:52.560]   moving images makes the biggest difference. And I will say, you know,
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.560]   that I suspect a lot of people are going to be very disappointed with my answers
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:00.240]   on growth here. And I will say,
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.000]   and this is such an old man thing to say, but I'll say it anyway,
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:09.040]   there is no magic bullet for growth and the tools
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:09.680]   change.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.640]   So I would suggest getting a book like the 22 immutable
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:19.360]   laws of marketing, reading a short chapter called the law of category.
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.120]   I believe I put an updated slash edited version of that in either tools of
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:28.640]   Titans or tribe mentors, because I think it's that valuable read the law of
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:32.240]   category, read 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly,
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:37.000]   which you can find on KK.org. These will give you principles,
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.960]   adaptable principles that will allow you to build a unique
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:46.520]   position in the minds of people who will become diehard
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.600]   evangelists. If you do that,
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:54.160]   which takes consistency over time and it takes focus more than anything else.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:59.920]   A lot of the other dominoes will tip over without any
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:04.800]   additional effort. But if instead of learning how to
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:06.760]   draw as an analogy,
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:10.440]   you're focused on whether you should use a ballpoint pen or a fountain pen or
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.400]   pastels or crayons or watercolors,
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:18.800]   meaning the different technologies and tools clubhouse versus
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.480]   Tik TOK versus Instagram versus Oh, vine. Remember that? Oops. Oh,
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.880]   if your promotional engine was based on that, Oh, Facebook business pages. Oh,
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:32.720]   yeah. You're going to need to boost to reach your audience. Now.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:33.720]   Sorry about that.
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:38.600]   There's too much fragility in a tactics or tools based approach.
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.440]   So I think the principles are most important,
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:45.760]   but I recognize also that perhaps I am just too far from
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:50.160]   the nascent years in which I built my blog following
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:54.920]   to provide a good answer. I will say though, that I built a very, very, very,
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:59.000]   very popular blog when practically no one knew who the hell I was.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.800]   And I did that by writing posts that I hoped 10%
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:08.200]   of my then very small audience would love.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:12.840]   I did not write posts that I wanted a hundred percent of my audience to
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:17.160]   like. And I do the same thing with podcasting. I think it works really well.
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:21.520]   So I do not expect my entire audience to love any episode.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:24.080]   And if I tried to do that, I think I would shoot myself in the foot.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:29.600]   I expect that my active audience will be in a rotation
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.520]   in every fourth or fifth, or maybe 10th episode.
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:37.440]   They will love so much that they will send it to 10 of their friends.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:42.600]   That is how I think about it. And I, I believe at least so far,
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.160]   it has been extremely, extremely effective.
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:49.240]   One of the pieces of feedback someone gave me on my show was that not every
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:50.680]   episode is relevant to them.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:54.800]   I did an episode where I interviewed a professional car buyer and they were
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:57.040]   like, I don't have a car. So this episode is pointless. They're like,
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:01.680]   maybe you should change the show so that everything's always relevant to
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:05.680]   everyone. And my answer was, I don't know, I'm going to buy a car.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.880]   I wanted to talk to someone that professionally does this.
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.720]   And that's super interesting to me. So just skip it and go to the next one.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.800]   Do you feel similarly? You said, you know,
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.640]   one in five to 10 people love that episode. Do you care?
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.800]   Or do you think they're listening to the other five to nine episodes?
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:26.080]   I don't care. I literally spend zero time thinking about it
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.800]   because, and this, this might sound strange,
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.880]   but for me to be, for me to have fun,
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.560]   for this to be a joyful experience that I look forward to,
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:43.560]   the podcast needs to have a certain essence,
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:48.560]   a certain pull for me, and it has to have a certain dosage.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:52.920]   So I have a very infrequent podcast. I do it on average,
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.960]   four times per month, or I publish four long form episodes per month.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:01.520]   We didn't really talk about recording cadence, which we could talk about,
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.120]   but on average, I publish four long form interviews per month.
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:07.040]   At one point it was six episodes.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.560]   And then I noticed a few months into doing that,
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:15.840]   I was starting to drag my feet a little bit and it began to
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:20.680]   feel like a job, like an obligation. And I noted that quickly,
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.440]   thankfully, and I said, this is no good. If I keep this up,
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:25.920]   I'm going to stop doing the podcast,
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:30.440]   or I'm just going to be unhappy doing it. In which case,
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.360]   what the fuck am I doing? Cause I don't need to do it.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:38.080]   And I then ratcheted back the frequency of the podcast to the point where it
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.600]   felt good. There's a dosage question,
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:46.800]   i.e. frequency. There's also an essence poll question. So for me,
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.880]   I have to follow my own interest and to be of a good steward of my own self
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:57.640]   care, but to also be of greatest service to the people who are listening,
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:01.520]   I need to keep doing this, or at least I hope to keep doing it.
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:02.520]   Maybe I don't need to,
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:07.520]   but I would like to keep doing this and to be able to grow over time and share
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.400]   those lessons.
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:13.400]   The only way I'm going to do that is if I am drawn to continue doing this
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.320]   because I enjoy it.
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:20.320]   So if I decide to do an episode with a violin appraiser and it gets 10
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:25.960]   listeners, I don't fucking care at all. As long as I enjoy the episode,
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:29.880]   I do not care. And I will say that over time,
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:36.320]   that not caring is the ultimate form of caring because you can cultivate
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:42.320]   an audience who is interested in stepping into weird,
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:47.320]   strange corners of the world into interests and professions and lives they
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:53.400]   perhaps otherwise would have ignored or avoided.
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:59.120]   So your audience will also change in how they relate to you over time.
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:03.080]   And at least in my experience,
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:08.200]   they I hope have realized that sometimes it is the absolute best way to
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:13.200]   get to the episode they least would have expected to want to listen to that
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:18.200]   they end up liking the most of perhaps the last 20 episodes I've done.
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:23.320]   So I think my listeners are more and more willing to give me the benefit of the
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:25.160]   doubt and try something strange.
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:28.920]   Yeah. I got some feedback from Joe Saul Chi,
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:31.200]   who runs a podcast called the stacking Benjamins,
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.400]   which is a funny like kind of different style podcast. But he said,
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:39.360]   the only thing you have to realize with guests is someone might listen to the
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.160]   episode for the guest, but at the end of the day,
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.360]   they're subscribing and coming back for you.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:47.400]   And so the nature of interviews though,
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:52.400]   often is we're trying to highlight the guest and hear their stories,
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.160]   which inherently if done well, is them talking more than you.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:59.240]   You mentioned earlier, if it's a bad guest,
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:00.960]   it might be you talking much more than them.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:06.040]   How do you make sure you interject enough of Tim into the podcast that new
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:10.760]   listeners and recurring listeners get that when the focus of each episode is,
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.120]   is always on someone else?
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.920]   That is a really good question.
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.400]   And the answer is I don't think about it at all,
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:25.520]   but there are some times when I will interject and it has a strategic purpose or
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:28.840]   a practical purpose.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.640]   There are interviews where I basically don't talk at all.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:37.640]   And if someone is just,
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:43.400]   you know, a woman or a man possessed and they are in flow, I will let them riff.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:47.840]   It'll just be an audio book of that person for an hour or two hours.
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:51.560]   You can listen to Tim Ferriss and Bology.
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.240]   That's an example of that. The four hour,
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:01.320]   every topic under the sun covered podcast,
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:06.400]   which was quite an experience to be on the receiving end of also great episode.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:08.800]   Very unusual.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:12.960]   And one of the best performing podcasts probably of the last year for me,
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:13.760]   which is saying a lot.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.160]   So if people look up my name or just go to tim.blog and search Bology,
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.520]   B-A-L-A-J-I. Yeah.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.480]   Put in a mouth guard and drink a few cups of coffee and prepare yourself for the
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:26.840]   onslaught. It's quite something,
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:32.160]   but I will interject in a few
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.000]   instances.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:39.000]   One is where I know I'm asking a question or I suspect I'm
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:39.760]   asking a question.
[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.880]   The guest is going to have trouble answering unless they have some time to think
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:47.040]   about it. So for instance,
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:53.040]   if I ask them, what is one of the best investments you've ever made,
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:57.200]   which by the way is better than what's the best investment you've ever made in
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.800]   the same way that what is one of the books you have gifted the most for other
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:05.840]   people is better than what's the best book you've ever read.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.280]   The search function is a lot harder.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.600]   It's going to take them much longer to try to come up with a single answer.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:15.720]   And they will generally default to recency.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:17.560]   They'll come up with something that happened recent.
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.920]   So you don't get the best answers. If I ask someone,
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:26.160]   for instance, what is one of the best investments you've ever made?
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.720]   And then I might buy them time by giving some examples. I'll say,
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:33.480]   let me give you a few examples and give you a second to think about it.
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:38.560]   It could be an investment of money like so-and-so say Warren Buffett
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:42.880]   who invested in Dale Carnegie speaking classes for public speaking.
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:47.000]   And he always cites that as his best ever investment because it is multiplied
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.120]   and magnified his ability to do everything else.
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:54.480]   It has been a supercharger for all of his other skills and talents.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:00.200]   It could be buying an entrance ticket to a competition
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.800]   that allowed you to prove yourself that then led to
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:09.640]   X. It could be an investment of energy. It could be anything. Okay.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:14.320]   I just gave everyone listening and you 45 to 60
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:18.960]   seconds to think about an answer as opposed to off the cuff,
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.680]   coming up with something as quickly as possible. Fortunately,
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.440]   you can take that approach. Or if you're not recording live,
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:31.760]   you can just say, take your time. We're not recording this live.
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:34.360]   You can take 30 seconds in silence to think about it.
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:39.440]   And then we can talk, but that feels strange to a lot of people,
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.520]   even though you can do that for a production standpoint,
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.280]   sitting in a conversation in silence,
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.720]   waiting for a minute for someone to answer feels unnatural and weird.
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:56.360]   So I will interject in a case like that very frequently when I
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:57.280]   speak up,
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.320]   it is to buy time for the interviewee and to give them a
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:07.120]   few examples to act as like auxiliary search
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:08.600]   functions in their own brains.
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:10.400]   They can come up with the best possible answer.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.640]   Yeah. I was thinking the whole time about my, my best investment.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:16.680]   Well, what is one of your best investments?
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:20.640]   Well, it's funny when I moved out to the Bay area, I didn't know anyone.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.560]   And I had recently been laid off. And so I didn't have any money,
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.240]   but I invested in a membership at the climbing gym down the street.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.480]   And at the time I thought this is climbing gyms are not cheap gyms.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:34.640]   There's cheaper gyms. But through the climbing gym,
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.520]   I met a guy named Daniel Berka who was at day through Daniel.
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:39.480]   I met Kevin through Kevin.
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:39.760]   I was like,
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:43.040]   it's literally probably the investment that ended up building out my entire
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:46.840]   network, including being here. But at the time it seemed, you know,
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.440]   it was like a hundred and 120 bucks a month. It seemed crazy, but yeah.
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.920]   Yeah. That's amazing. Was that mission cliffs or where were you?
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:54.080]   It was mission cliffs.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.840]   Yeah. Yeah. That's a great gym. I remember mission cliffs back at,
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:01.280]   back in the day. So that's a fun question to ask.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.560]   If I ask someone about favorite failures,
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:06.600]   just the phrasing of the question is very confusing for a lot of people.
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:07.920]   So then I'll give them an example.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:13.400]   And the other time that I'll chime in as if the interview
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.440]   is drowning in boredom
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:20.720]   as a rescue attempt.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:23.040]   So that's a lot about, about Tim.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.240]   So I want to talk a little bit about the transition early.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:28.920]   Tim was really just the four hour guy, right?
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:31.520]   You had three books in a row where that was the theme.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:33.800]   Someone told me once they said, Hey, you know,
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:36.880]   your cover art for an episode of podcasts, everything,
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:41.120]   nothing has anything about you on it. So I took a similar early on approach,
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:46.040]   where this story of the show is all about what the show's about all the
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:49.720]   hacks. It's not about me at all. And people are like, well, who are you?
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.280]   And you made a transition. Now your podcast is, you know, the Tim Ferriss show.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:54.720]   It's nothing to do with four hour.
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:58.280]   I get the sense that you're trying to run away from being the four hour guy,
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.440]   but how have you thought about that transition and making it and
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:08.320]   making a brand that is really about you instead of something
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.160]   else?
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.160]   I'm going to tackle this from oblique angle
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:19.440]   and I'll couch it under the umbrella
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:24.000]   of identity diversification and also
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.880]   optionality. So flashing back to the four hour work week,
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:32.720]   four hour work week was this huge, unexpected hit.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.000]   It stayed on the New York times list for four to five years straight every week.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.040]   And it created in a,
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:45.400]   an abundance of inbound opportunity.
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:51.560]   Almost all the requests were expectedly related to the four hour work week.
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:52.960]   So I was the four hour work week guy.
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:55.440]   We want you to give a talk on the principles of the four hour work week.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.840]   You want me to do consulting to help us improve efficiency and
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.360]   per hour yield within this organization. We want you to do this workshop.
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.240]   We want you to license the name so we can develop
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:14.320]   ABCD&E. We want to option it for a movie,
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.120]   which is almost always a dead end, by the way, if people are wondering,
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:21.160]   we want to talk to you about a musical. We want to do this. We want to do that.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:24.040]   Most of those things all came to zero,
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:29.360]   but all of the external pressures were to
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:33.640]   milk that for everything that it was worth. In other words,
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.960]   I would write the four hour work week volume two,
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:40.360]   or I would write the three hour work week.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.800]   I would continue to beat that drum until
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:50.200]   I had shaggy gray eyebrows and could
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.440]   bang the drum no more, right? That was going to be me.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:57.840]   And I saw many authors around me who I
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:01.840]   met on the speaking circuit early on. When I did that, I no longer,
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:05.240]   and for many years have done no paid speaking,
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:10.320]   which was a categorical decision and policy that was one of those
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:12.320]   decisions that removes a thousand decisions.
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.240]   For many reasons we could talk about.
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:20.960]   The short answer is I was repeating myself. And when you repeat yourself,
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:22.800]   this is relevant to my point.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:27.480]   When you repeat the same messages, as my friend,
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:30.560]   Josh Waits can point out to me, you begin to calcify your thinking.
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:37.080]   And you're also repeating it because you are being paid for
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.440]   this perishable product,
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:43.160]   which is speaking to audiences over and over again about the same
[02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:44.000]   thing.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:49.800]   And I recognized I did not want to be many of the
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:53.880]   people I met who had been milking the same thing for a very long time.
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:55.880]   They didn't seem particularly happy about it.
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:58.360]   They didn't seem energized by it.
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:03.160]   They seemed drained and they seemed to feel trapped to
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:06.320]   me, which is why given the success of the book,
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:11.440]   I decided to maintain preserve the brand
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:12.760]   recognition of four hour,
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.200]   but move it into physical performance with the four hour body,
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:20.480]   because I recognized I might never have this chance again
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.920]   to step out, to have licensed,
[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:25.520]   to go to a completely different section of the bookstore,
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:26.880]   completely different subject matter,
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:30.760]   but I could always go back to the four hour work week.
[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:35.280]   So I could always return to that comfortable, familiar,
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:38.640]   well-worn path of these principles outlined in the four hour work week.
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:42.280]   So this is, I think, an important part of the backstory.
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:47.240]   So I decided to go to four hour body. Four hour body does extremely well.
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:51.120]   Four hour body hits number one, New York times still sells extremely well.
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:56.520]   And that then bought me the license to
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:59.360]   write the four hour chef where I'm taking these principles,
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:03.040]   which also come up in your podcast a fair amount with Andy Ratcliffe recently
[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:06.520]   of Wealthfront, the 80/20 principle.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:10.880]   So Pareto's law and many different
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:15.840]   principles that you could apply to deconstructing entrepreneurship and
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:18.680]   testing assumptions apply equally to physical performance.
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:22.640]   They apply equally to accelerated learning, language acquisition,
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:23.800]   cooking doesn't matter.
[02:22:23.800 --> 02:22:29.360]   So now I had proven to the people who pay me
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:31.320]   at least upfront, the publishers,
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:36.360]   and also proven to my audience that what was interesting
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:42.000]   was the adventures and the principles, not any specific subject matter.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.240]   It's hard for me to overstate how important that is.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.200]   I was no longer trapped in one section of the bookstore.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:52.360]   I could write about anything I wanted. Now I had license to do that. Okay.
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:56.960]   The four hour chef almost killed me.
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:00.640]   It was an incredibly complex, extremely difficult project.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:04.000]   It was the first major acquisition by Amazon publishing when they were really
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.680]   stepping into publishing in a big way. The entire publishing world freaked out.
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:10.440]   Barnes and Noble wouldn't carry the book. I mean,
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.600]   it was exciting and also a huge mess on many levels.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.600]   And each book launch,
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:23.480]   I would talk to bestselling authors who had
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:26.800]   launched in the preceding, say 12 months. And I would ask them,
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.680]   which channels tools and outlets did less than they expected or were
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:36.560]   waning in importance and impact and which did more than they
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:40.600]   expected and seemed to be in, in a scent. So for the,
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:44.560]   for our work week blogs were neglected largely. I mean,
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:49.560]   blogs were incredibly powerful neglected. That's where I focused with the,
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:51.160]   for our body.
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:55.440]   I asked the same questions and I explored a bunch of different channels for the
[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:58.640]   four hour chef, the medium and the tool,
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:03.680]   the channel that was most undervalued, but most impactful was podcasting.
[02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:07.760]   So I focused on podcasting for the launch of the four hour chef and these
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.080]   podcasts had incredible impact,
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:14.440]   much more impact than huge television shows.
[02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:18.640]   And in the process of doing that,
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:23.680]   I really realized how much I enjoyed the long form conversations where you
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.800]   could be yourself. You could drop an F bomb if need be, or if,
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:31.600]   if that was your, your penchant for just speaking casually and comfortably,
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.920]   versus say being on morning television, which can have some impact,
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:40.800]   but we seem to have less and less of an impact where someone is staring over
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:44.880]   your shoulder at a teleprompter and you literally have 30 seconds to talk after
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:49.120]   spending like an hour waiting in the green room after having your face spray
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:52.360]   painted with makeup. And you woke up at 5:00 AM to get there.
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.120]   It's not that enjoyable an experience. So I saw the impact.
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:00.080]   I enjoyed the podcasting and decided then at that point,
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:02.120]   I'm going to take a big break from books.
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:05.440]   Not sure I'm ever going to write another book, but in the meantime,
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:10.800]   I'd like to experiment with this podcasting format and see what it's like to be
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:12.740]   in the director's seat, so to speak.
[02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:18.840]   And the only reason the podcast ended up with the Tim Ferriss show is the name
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.840]   is I couldn't come up with a name and Kevin called it Tim Tim talk talk in the
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:27.980]   first episode, which long-term listeners still joke about. And I still joke,
[02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:29.780]   Kevin and I still joke about,
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:33.980]   but came up with all of these different names for it.
[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:37.220]   And the fact of the matter was at that time,
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:41.500]   there were only two things that had a lot of brand recognition,
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:46.820]   the four hour stick, which I didn't want to extend.
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:51.500]   I wanted to retire that Jersey or my name.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:56.820]   And that is the reason that I decided to use the name.
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:01.540]   But if you're just starting a podcast and you don't have any name recognition,
[02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:06.100]   I don't think that the logic automatically follows that you should use your name.
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.020]   Now it's been a wonderful trip.
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:14.060]   I will say that there are drawbacks to launching a podcast with your name in the
[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:20.140]   same way that their drawbacks to founding a company that can only be run by you.
[02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.780]   As we've seen in the news,
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:27.800]   there are a lot of big deals by podcast standards happening at the moment.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.460]   There is a land grab for talent and big shows and audience.
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:36.380]   So you have Joe Rogan purportedly a hundred million dollar deal.
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:38.740]   I actually think if I had to guess, I don't know this,
[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:42.100]   but I would suspect it is substantially larger than that over time with earn
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:46.100]   outs and so on and performance bonuses. I would guess it's much larger than that.
[02:26:46.100 --> 02:26:50.460]   I think there was somewhere between 60 and a hundred million dollar deal for
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:55.460]   Dax Shepard, something like a $60 million deal for call her daddy.
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:57.940]   I think that's a three year deal.
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:03.260]   You will notice that the deal terms appear to be getting more and more
[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:06.620]   onerous. Now, those are not all comparable deals.
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.860]   Those are different people, different properties and so on.
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:12.020]   But I believe as part of the deal with call her daddy,
[02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:17.500]   that Spotify has a first look or write a first refusal or automatic ownership of
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:25.140]   future properties and creations, not just current Joe Rogan has a licensing deal.
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:29.340]   It's just very different from an IP purchase agreement.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:34.060]   But this is all to say that if I had,
[02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.700]   let's just say, who knows the four hour podcast,
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:43.300]   if I'd called it the four hour podcast and I owned that trademark and slowly
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:48.380]   brought in other hosts or co-hosts to help,
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:54.220]   one could foresee an option of building that up into a four hour podcast.
[02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:59.220]   Building that up into a property with many different personalities and selling
[02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:03.980]   that property after which I,
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:09.180]   as the initial builder of that brand could be free and clear to go on and do
[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:10.020]   other things.
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:15.220]   It is not possible to do that simply with a podcast called the Tim Ferriss show.
[02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:20.300]   So there are drawbacks, but net net, that's the story of how I got there.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:23.180]   And I don't think about building a personal brand to be clear.
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:27.820]   You have a personal brand already. Everyone has a personal brand.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.900]   Guess what your personal brand is.
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:33.900]   Your personal brand is what your closest friends and family and coworkers think
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:36.500]   of you. That's it. What do they associate you with, right?
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:39.420]   If they had to pull four or five adjectives out of the air,
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:42.300]   how would they describe you? Whatever comes to mind,
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:46.420]   most naturally when people think about you, that is your personal brand.
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:48.500]   So we all already have a personal brand.
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:53.500]   If you want to create a personal facade or a stage persona,
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:57.420]   I'm not saying you Chris, but just in general, you can do that,
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:58.820]   but you should be very careful of that.
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:04.460]   And I remember I was told and I'm paraphrasing here,
[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:08.740]   but by Andrew Zimmern, who is an amazing television host,
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.700]   who is very smart and very, very thoughtful.
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:16.420]   He's been on the podcast. His story is incredible. I mean, he was,
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:21.420]   I think sleeping on a mattress under an overpass at one point as an addict and
[02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:25.460]   now is who he is. It's a really remarkable story,
[02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:29.780]   but when he was just getting started in television and he and I spoke when I was
[02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:31.500]   doing some television, not too long ago,
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:37.020]   he had some choices to make in that first episode about who he wanted to be and
[02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:38.780]   how did he want to deliver his lines?
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:42.380]   Were they going to incorporate any particular types of sticks?
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:44.820]   Were they going to be funny?
[02:29:44.820 --> 02:29:47.700]   Were they going to make fun of certain things?
[02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:51.180]   Were they going to use the cheesy jokes?
[02:29:51.180 --> 02:29:56.620]   And he made a lot of decisions early on that ended up being critical to the
[02:29:56.620 --> 02:30:01.060]   future of his career because he said, in effect,
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:03.500]   be very careful of who you are in episode one,
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:06.620]   because that's who you have to be for the rest of the time you're on television.
[02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.940]   And I think that's true podcasting.
[02:30:09.220 --> 02:30:13.980]   So be really careful about what you pretend to be because you will have to
[02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:17.220]   maintain that. And you may actually become whatever you pretend to be.
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:22.140]   So I don't, I don't think a whole lot about personal brand,
[02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:25.660]   although I do think about what I want to stand for.
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:30.540]   And if I were really true to myself,
[02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:34.540]   like if I were really true to myself, what would I do? Who would I interview?
[02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:37.500]   If I were just doing this for me, what would I do?
[02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:41.020]   And I always get the best results when I do that.
[02:30:41.020 --> 02:30:44.380]   When I try to predict the movement of
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:49.860]   the masses of some potential audience, like this, you know,
[02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:53.060]   flock of birds where I'm trying to guess which direction they're going to fly.
[02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:57.620]   It never turns out well for me, especially it's not fun.
[02:30:57.620 --> 02:30:59.260]   And it's not particularly effective.
[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:03.180]   One of the things you mentioned in that story was about these podcasts,
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:05.460]   getting these licensing deals or different things,
[02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:08.940]   a common thing that I know happens with podcasts,
[02:31:08.940 --> 02:31:12.420]   especially as they start to gain traction and has happened to me in the last
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:16.100]   couple of weeks is some podcast network will reach out and say, Hey,
[02:31:16.100 --> 02:31:18.740]   do you want to join our network? Do you want to be an iHeartRadio podcast?
[02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:22.900]   Do you want to, and usually get to keep all your IP, but they basically say,
[02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:26.300]   Hey, we'll sell ads. We'll keep 50%. We'll help you grow your show.
[02:31:26.300 --> 02:31:28.700]   We'll do all this stuff. You don't have to do it. Think about it.
[02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:30.500]   We'll just give you the money we make.
[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:34.260]   And it seems to your point about monetization,
[02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:37.260]   don't spend any time on it, spend time honing your craft,
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:38.820]   spend time making a good show.
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:44.140]   Is that a good way to kind of take all of that off your plate from thinking
[02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:44.660]   about it?
[02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:49.380]   Would you encourage people to take those calls because they don't result in
[02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:54.220]   having to spend time selling ads though you lose upside for whatever
[02:31:54.220 --> 02:31:55.380]   term that deal is?
[02:31:55.380 --> 02:32:00.340]   This is a worthwhile topic to explore. So clearly, or maybe it's not clear,
[02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:04.260]   but I do not work with a network or a partner of that type.
[02:32:04.580 --> 02:32:07.180]   A lot of people do. A lot of people do.
[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:11.780]   And I think it depends a lot on what you
[02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:15.300]   are trying to accomplish.
[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:18.220]   So a question everyone should ask is three years from now,
[02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:22.260]   your podcast is successful. What does that mean to you? What does it look like?
[02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:23.140]   Exactly.
[02:32:23.140 --> 02:32:26.940]   What does a month in your life look like with respect to the podcast?
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:30.460]   It's successful. What does that mean? What does it look like?
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:34.180]   So it depends on that. It also depends on your competencies,
[02:32:34.180 --> 02:32:38.820]   your willingness to hire or work with
[02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:43.380]   contractors or commissioned salespeople to sell ads
[02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:47.980]   or sponsorships or find sponsors. If that is something that you want to do,
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:51.860]   is it worthwhile to take the calls? It's always worthwhile to take the calls.
[02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:54.340]   Just don't promise anything. Yeah, definitely take the calls.
[02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:57.820]   And the question that I would ask myself in preparation for those calls is how
[02:32:57.820 --> 02:33:02.180]   can I learn as much as possible from this call so that even if I never end up
[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:06.140]   talking to this person again, I get a lot out of this.
[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:09.380]   Can you ask about best practices of other podcasts?
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:14.460]   Can you ask about common mistakes that highly competent
[02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:18.860]   but novice or new to the game podcasters make in their experience?
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:23.220]   Can you ask them or indicate as a policy,
[02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:24.540]   when you have these types of conversations,
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:29.460]   you always ask if I couldn't work with you, who would you recommend I work with?
[02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:32.340]   Can you start to get a better understanding of the ecosystem?
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:37.900]   Can you ask them about other players in the system?
[02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:39.500]   In other words,
[02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:44.660]   further your education and give yourself more and more of an
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:49.540]   informational advantage, even if you never do a deal with these people.
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:53.780]   If you're willing to prepare in that way, come up with good questions,
[02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:55.420]   absolutely take the call.
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:34:00.380]   If you're just going to fly off the cuff and see what happens,
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:02.220]   maybe it's still worth taking the call,
[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:04.300]   although you won't get as much out of it, but yes,
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:08.620]   it's absolutely worth taking the call and listening to their value proposition.
[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:13.020]   There are a number of different ways that you can sell ads.
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:18.020]   You can publish on a platform that inserts ads
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:22.580]   automatically. And there are platforms, I believe Spotify has this ability.
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:26.980]   There are platforms that can do this. There are also hosting companies,
[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:32.020]   I believe that will use dynamic ad insertion to fill ad
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:36.660]   inventory for you, your revenue from that,
[02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:40.980]   your income from that, your CPM,
[02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:46.060]   the cost per thousand downloads that you get paid will be quite low for that.
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:46.940]   Generally speaking,
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:52.780]   you can work with a network and that network may have people in-house,
[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:56.220]   but the network could be a network,
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:59.220]   just like you and I back in the day could print a business card,
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:01.140]   which is like Christian associates.
[02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:03.460]   And in fact,
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:08.260]   all they're doing is partnering with yet another company and then they're
[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:13.220]   splitting the commission or the VIG between them.
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:16.940]   So that's another thing that you would want to ask.
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:20.700]   Although I would ask it at the end of the conversation in case it pisses them
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:23.460]   off, are these full-time employees of yours?
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:24.980]   Do you partner with other companies?
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:28.100]   Do you subcontract out pieces of this to get an idea of how things are
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:31.620]   architected? So you could partner with a network.
[02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:35.780]   And if they say we will help grow your show,
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:40.060]   I would find out exactly how they do that. Gimlet, of course,
[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:43.820]   does a good job of this as do many of the NPR shows,
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:48.460]   because they cross promote new shows on existing properties.
[02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:51.500]   If they're going to do that, find out what the reach is,
[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:54.980]   find out if that's going to be for all geographies,
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:58.060]   or is it going to be a geo limited? Is it time limited? Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:00.820]   All the specifics, right? That's probably for a second conversation.
[02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:04.180]   It's not that important compared to other questions you could ask.
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:05.860]   That's a network.
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:11.140]   You could work with companies who
[02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:15.900]   sell ads. That's it. That's all they do. They're not a network,
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:20.700]   but they will put sponsors in front of you and put your show in
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:23.540]   front of sponsors. And there are many,
[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:25.780]   many different agencies that do this,
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:29.300]   just like ad agencies for other types of media.
[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:32.460]   And the economics will look slightly different depending on who you talk to.
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:34.700]   And they'll be different probably from the networks.
[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:36.340]   Then there are very,
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:40.540]   very small shops with maybe a handful of people and they
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.940]   handle ads for larger shows.
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:46.220]   So I will not mention them by name just because I don't want them to get
[02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:50.580]   deluged. But if you're diligent, you can figure it out. Joe Rogan,
[02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:54.140]   Dax, This American Life all work with the same small outfit
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:37:00.140]   who only work with a handful of premium properties and they sell ads
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.100]   for those outlets.
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:06.580]   Then you can have a contractor or hire someone full-time as
[02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:09.500]   I did to handle all of your ad inventory.
[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:13.820]   I am comfortable as an operator. I'm very, very, very,
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:15.940]   very comfortable with sales.
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:20.940]   And I'm very, very comfortable with waiting until
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:22.740]   in this case,
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:27.260]   my podcast had enough of an audience and not just a large
[02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:29.260]   audience in terms of size,
[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:34.140]   but a powerful audience in terms of influence such
[02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:38.500]   that I would be able to say no very easily and
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:40.980]   still have takers. Does that make sense?
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:45.620]   And then to set terms like no payment terms,
[02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:50.660]   you need to pay upfront so that we can keep our process extremely,
[02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:54.900]   extremely simple. And in that case, I looked at it and I was like, okay,
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:38:00.020]   let's just take, I mean, you can do some back of the napkin stuff,
[02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:02.580]   but it's like, all right, if I won't use Joe as an example,
[02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:04.740]   I'll let people try to figure that out on their own.
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:08.580]   But for him to do a deal of several years at a hundred million dollars,
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:11.340]   that would have to be a multiple of what he was making.
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:15.980]   He was making, I am sure a lot,
[02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:20.700]   but let's say that you get to the point where you are making a small fraction of
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:24.900]   that and you make a million dollars in total ad revenue,
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:29.860]   which assuming you don't have much staff is almost pure profit.
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:33.980]   If you outsource your ad sales,
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:39.300]   I would say you should expect generally that at least
[02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:42.500]   30% of that is going to go away. Okay.
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:45.180]   So I'm no mathematician,
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:49.020]   but that is more than $300,000.
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:53.300]   So then the question is for less than $300,000,
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:59.060]   could you hire someone who is absolutely excellent to do it for
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.300]   you? And are, this is just as critical.
[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:06.900]   Are you willing to have staff manage,
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:12.660]   do the calls, do the data analytics and so on everything necessary
[02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:17.020]   to ensure that those operations are extremely smooth?
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:21.420]   And the answer for a lot of people is no, even if you have the money,
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:27.060]   they would rather spend the $300,000
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:30.940]   plus in this case. Now, keep in mind, you know,
[02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:35.420]   if you're making 10 million a year, then now we're talking 3 million plus,
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:41.300]   it can be very, very expensive, but it's worth it for a lot of people.
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:44.860]   For me, I decided I had enough entrepreneurial experience.
[02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:50.260]   I am comfortable enough with operations and process and management that
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:55.260]   I am totally happy to hire someone
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:58.060]   full-time to handle that for me. So that is what I decided.
[02:39:58.060 --> 02:40:01.540]   Okay. So we've hit a lot of things. We have,
[02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:03.980]   here's a great question about a question,
[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:08.620]   which is if you're interviewing someone about a topic and you realize well
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:10.700]   past the point that you've talked about something,
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:14.380]   that there's a great followup, but you're now, you know,
[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:16.420]   three turns down on a different highway.
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:21.340]   Do you ask it still? And if you do,
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:25.140]   do you try to edit it back so it fits or do you just save it for next time?
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:26.900]   I've done all of the above.
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:30.300]   So if we're down this road and there's something I really want to ask,
[02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:33.580]   you have many, many options for me.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:36.780]   One option would be you write down on a piece of paper.
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:37.900]   This is why I like to have notes.
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:41.780]   I take a lot of notes as I'm writing on things that I want to come back to also,
[02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:44.820]   or things that I want to ensure I don't forget. So I'll take that.
[02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:48.700]   I'll circle it on a piece of paper and I'll say, if you don't mind,
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:50.100]   I want to interrupt for just a second.
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:54.340]   This is going to be a complete left turn. And for all my listeners, sorry,
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:58.460]   that's just how my mind works. I really want to just put a bookmark in this.
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:01.020]   So please remember where you are. I'm going to write it down.
[02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:06.060]   I want to ask you about X, and then we're going to come back to Y and Z.
[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:07.300]   And so you can do that.
[02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:13.020]   You could take a note of it and then use a teaser at the end of the episode and
[02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:13.860]   say,
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:17.180]   we could easily keep talking for many hours.
[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:22.220]   We might have to do a round two if you'd be open to it and simply circle that
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:24.220]   and highlighter R2 like I do. I mean,
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:27.300]   there are different ways to approach this and save it for next time.
[02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:32.700]   You could try to edit and splice somewhere else and kind of Frank and
[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:37.220]   clip your way into some type of narrative that tends to be,
[02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:42.620]   or can be very clumsy and labor intensive. So I, I tend not to do that.
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:46.660]   Well, then I'll just throw it out here. Cause it's a, it's about a guest.
[02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:48.860]   One of the things I found,
[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:53.060]   I heard you say that you got a lot of guests by asking people, Hey,
[02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:56.580]   you are a guest. Are there other interesting people I should have on this show?
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:59.740]   In recruiting, I've learned that when you go to people and say, Hey,
[02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:02.820]   are there interesting engineers I should hire? Everyone has nothing.
[02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:05.980]   They have to use that search function. But if you go look at their LinkedIn and
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:08.380]   say, Hey, here are four people that you know,
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:11.540]   that I think could be good for this job. If you think any of them are,
[02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:13.460]   would you introduce me to them? That works well.
[02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:18.460]   Is there a tactic you've used to find guests from your
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:23.060]   network of either friends or guests that helps them kind of jog the memory
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:24.900]   to find the people that might be interesting?
[02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:31.100]   No, it's a short answer. I don't have any particular tricks here.
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:35.500]   I will mention to people, I'll say, you know,
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:38.420]   I really enjoyed speaking with you. You're excellent at what you do.
[02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:41.300]   And this was outstanding.
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:46.380]   If you ever think of anybody who you think would really enjoy being on the show,
[02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:49.220]   who I would also really enjoy speaking to, please let me know.
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:52.300]   And I just leave it at that. I would say at this point,
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:56.860]   probably 80% plus of my guests come as referrals from past guests.
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:01.820]   And it will become easier and easier over time.
[02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:05.500]   When you have 15 episodes, it's harder. It's just a smaller sample size.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:08.100]   When you have 30, 50, there is a,
[02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:12.820]   there's a non-linear kind of growth in the
[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:17.580]   connectivity of the map that you're creating this constellation of guests and
[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:21.300]   the types of people they can reach. So it gets,
[02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:25.740]   I would say exponentially easier over time to get
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:30.140]   referrals. And I will also say just as a side note,
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:35.820]   a question that you can ask to also improve
[02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:40.900]   your interviewing and podcasting is one that
[02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:43.940]   Adam Grant asked me when he was a guest on the podcast,
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.220]   after we stopped recording and you need to be insistent,
[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:51.740]   but he said, or he asked rather,
[02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:53.620]   what can I do to improve?
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:59.220]   And I gave him some throwaway answer because it's an uncomfortable
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:04.020]   question. So I said something like, it was great. It was really fantastic.
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:05.780]   And it was, he was really, really, really good.
[02:44:06.140 --> 02:44:11.020]   And I'm pretty sure he responded with, I appreciate that.
[02:44:11.020 --> 02:44:15.460]   I appreciate the kind of feedback and I'm not going to let you go until you give
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:16.900]   me one thing, just one thing,
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:21.260]   anything could be small that I could do to improve as a guest.
[02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:26.340]   And I think he had a habit of, I don't want to say nervous,
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:30.540]   but laughing a lot after certain questions or answers.
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:31.380]   And I said,
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:35.540]   that might be something that you could take a look at if it was one thing.
[02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:37.660]   And I had to pick one thing you're outstanding.
[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:41.740]   It was absolutely wonderful as is, but if I had to pick one thing,
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:44.460]   that would probably be it. And he was like, awesome. Great. Thank you so much.
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:47.700]   And he was stoked. Yeah.
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:51.900]   If you want to get that type of feedback, you have to be insistent,
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:53.540]   I think because it's uncomfortable.
[02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:56.820]   You're putting someone in an uncomfortable position right after you've done this
[02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:57.580]   thing.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:02.420]   You're feeling good probably to deliver news that you might not like.
[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:04.860]   And so you have to just say, look, I love this stuff.
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:08.860]   I'm not going to let you go. Just give you one thing. Could be anything,
[02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:13.620]   tiny thing, something that I could do to improve and that gets results.
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:19.060]   And that is my dog barking because I have a delivery coming to the
[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:19.820]   door.
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:23.860]   So I think we should probably wrap up in a few minutes since we're almost at
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:28.260]   three hours, but I know you have prepared more.
[02:45:28.260 --> 02:45:32.300]   And so who knows, maybe there is around two in our future,
[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:36.660]   but what other boxes do you think we should check?
[02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:39.580]   I have a good kind of wrap up question.
[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:44.420]   At least is you launched your show and you said you'd commit to six episodes.
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:47.460]   And I've seen you say you'd reassess then.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:51.020]   And then after deciding to continue, I saw you say you'd reassess again at a
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:55.500]   hundred. What kind of a process do you go through when you reassess?
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:56.420]   Is it just a gut?
[02:45:56.420 --> 02:46:00.860]   Do I want to keep going or was there more going on each time you hit that
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:02.980]   milestone? It's a pretty simple check-in.
[02:46:02.980 --> 02:46:07.820]   I think most things can be boiled down to how do you feel when you first wake up
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:10.220]   and how easily do you go to sleep?
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:14.500]   Like how do different decisions affect that? Certainly true.
[02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:17.380]   And investing big time, like you could have on paper,
[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:18.700]   the best investment of all time.
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:21.140]   But if you're waking up anxious and having trouble going to sleep,
[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:23.180]   it's probably not a good investment for you.
[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:25.980]   And this is true for podcasting too.
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:30.100]   How do you feel when you look at your calendar and you see that you have a
[02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:34.580]   podcast at 10 AM or 2 PM or whenever it is, what happens internally?
[02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:38.620]   Is it a whole body? Yes. I mean, how do you feel mentally?
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:40.060]   How do you feel kind of in your chest?
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:44.420]   How do you feel in your gut and really paying attention to that?
[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:49.420]   It's a full body check-in for me. Imagine,
[02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:51.540]   okay, it's Tuesday,
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:56.900]   you're tired and all you want to do is call it quits.
[02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:01.420]   But you realize you've got 90 to 120 minutes ahead of you for a podcast.
[02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:06.300]   How do you feel? What do you do? What is your self-talk? What does it look like?
[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:07.740]   What has it been?
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:11.940]   Those are the types of questions that I ask myself.
[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:17.020]   And I want podcasting to be something that
[02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:20.780]   nourishes me and refills me, not something that pleats me.
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:26.700]   And I think many, if not most of my decisions these days,
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:31.980]   with respect to just about anything are framed in that way.
[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:36.660]   And it's simple,
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:41.380]   but the implications are pretty far reaching. It has nothing to do with revenue.
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:45.300]   It has nothing to do with how big the names are. It's really,
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:47.620]   how do I feel when I see it on the calendar?
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:53.020]   How do I feel when I'm recording? How do I feel when it comes out?
[02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:57.420]   Is it net positive energy or net negative energy?
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:01.740]   And if it's net positive and keep feeding the dragon,
[02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:07.660]   that's how I feel. And also you can build in the ability to take breaks.
[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:12.180]   So for instance, to touch on one thing that I dropped a long time ago,
[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:14.940]   which was recording cadence. And by the way,
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:16.780]   your brain is really incredibly trainable.
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:19.460]   You get better at doing this as you record more and more podcasts,
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:23.500]   just like mentally bookmarking things to come back to recording cadence.
[02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:28.580]   So I will very often once per quarter, do a content creation week,
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:34.020]   which includes all of any social needs and all of my podcast needs for the next
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:35.980]   three months.
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:40.980]   And I will record all of them in perhaps one week,
[02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:42.220]   Monday to Friday,
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:46.500]   or I may tag on an extra Monday, Tuesday and the following week.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:51.580]   And I will record all, which for me means 12 say episodes for the next three
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:54.660]   months. And then if I want to do more episodes,
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:58.460]   if I feel compelled, if there are things that pop up like this episode,
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:00.380]   for instance, I don't need to record this episode.
[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:02.740]   We're recording this early September.
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:07.060]   I have all of my episodes until probably December covered already they're done.
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:10.420]   I don't have to do a thing. I can sit back and chill,
[02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:14.220]   but I wanted to record this episode because I get so many questions about
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:16.420]   podcasts. And I also wanted to answer your questions.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:20.340]   So you can batch recording in that way.
[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:26.100]   I batch any sponsor recording in a similar way so that I'm not doing,
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:30.900]   by the way, like refreshes people who want a live read every time,
[02:49:30.900 --> 02:49:34.780]   not going to do it. If you have an ad that is working,
[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:39.820]   do you keep using it until it stops working in terms of your sort of return on
[02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:44.660]   invested capital, right? Your multiple, whatever it might be.
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:47.420]   And their answer is, Oh, we keep using, I'm like, that's exactly what we do.
[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:49.460]   So once we have a good read, we keep using it.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:54.060]   And for that reason, I'll batch recording for sponsors in a similar way.
[02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:59.300]   And any review of guests with one person on my team,
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:04.340]   we will know more than once a week for a very short period of time,
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:06.500]   maybe five or 10 minutes review,
[02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:11.500]   potential guests who have come in typically from past guests and decide how I
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:14.420]   feel about them. It doesn't matter how interesting they are,
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:19.060]   how good they are, what they do at the end of the day, like zero to 10,
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.460]   no seven allowed. What's my stoke level.
[02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:25.940]   If it's not an eight, nine or 10, we do not press go.
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:31.740]   And that is also some of how I systematize the production and the editing and so
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:40.220]   on such that the tasks and the responsibilities of the podcast are going to be
[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:43.660]   kind of willy nilly all over my calendar,
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:48.700]   which is very would be, I think, stressful and ultimately a net negative
[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:53.740]   energetically. So batching also helps to make things much more fun,
[02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:58.260]   much easier, much more streamlined and much less expensive.
[02:50:58.260 --> 02:51:01.340]   And ultimately coming back to the very beginning,
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:05.460]   much more sustainable and
[02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:08.260]   for all of those reasons and more,
[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:13.260]   I don't have a set time to check in with myself about the podcast.
[02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:18.260]   I batch and I expect if you check in with me five years from now,
[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:20.940]   unless something really strange has happened,
[02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:22.220]   I'll probably still be doing the podcast.
[02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:26.620]   But was the batching always there or, you know,
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:29.060]   you only committed to six episodes at the gate.
[02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:32.940]   That means in episode seven, you needed to find a way to do it.
[02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:37.940]   How long did it take to get to that batching versus just in time like I need to
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:41.220]   go set up an interview so that I can release an episode next week?
[02:51:41.220 --> 02:51:43.860]   Well, the batching is as needed.
[02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:48.860]   So they're batching has some practical utility in the sense that you finish
[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:52.140]   everything in one week as necessary for the next two to three months.
[02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:55.020]   But I also get energized by the podcast.
[02:51:55.020 --> 02:52:00.060]   So I will sometimes do an interview and I will do an interview and I will do
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:04.100]   energized by the podcast. So I will sometimes decide, you know what?
[02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:06.940]   I'm not going to batch all of my recording,
[02:52:06.940 --> 02:52:11.300]   but I'm going to do one recording per week or every other week because I find
[02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:16.140]   that it refills my tank. So it's not a burden to be lightened.
[02:52:16.140 --> 02:52:19.980]   It is also something that gives me more fuel for everything else that I'm doing.
[02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:23.980]   Therefore, I'm not going to record everything in the batching session,
[02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:29.100]   but I will record enough so that I don't feel like I have a gun against my head
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:30.260]   and oh shit,
[02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:34.860]   it's Tuesday and I need to put out an episode on Thursday. Fuck.
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:36.900]   Now I need to rejig my whole schedule.
[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:40.460]   That's not an experience I want to have and it's one that I can very easily
[02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:41.300]   avoid.
[02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:45.500]   So the batching and the systematizing comes in my experience later,
[02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:49.040]   you got to throw a lot against the wall and figure out what works and what works
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:49.880]   for you.
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:53.780]   And then you can establish policies and rules so that you're making very few
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:58.660]   decisions instead of a death by a million paper
[02:52:58.660 --> 02:52:59.500]   cuts.
[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:04.140]   And I do think that striving for
[02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:09.420]   what excites you and striving for what nourishes you goes a really
[02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:12.620]   long way. And to come back to a couple of recommendations,
[02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:16.980]   the 22 immutable laws of marketing, the law of category, read that chapter,
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:20.860]   even if the examples are outdated, read it, get the older copy,
[02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:22.460]   not the for the internet.
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:26.780]   Cause I think the for the internet was written like 98 or 99 and the examples are
[02:53:26.780 --> 02:53:31.420]   really funny, but get the older version positioning by the same authors,
[02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:37.060]   Reese, R I E S not Eric, but an older Reese and
[02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:41.940]   trout, I believe are the names as well as 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly
[02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:45.020]   at kk.org. Kevin Kelly, honestly, maybe the, the,
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:48.900]   the real life most interesting man in the world. And if you want proof of that,
[02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:51.420]   you can listen to my first podcast episode with him.
[02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:54.740]   Stuart brand might be a also a close contender.
[02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:58.100]   I think Kevin would probably say Stuart brand is the one who wins that title,
[02:53:58.100 --> 02:54:01.860]   but it's a fun game. I encourage everyone to try it.
[02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:04.540]   You'll learn a lot about yourself at the very least.
[02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:06.700]   I definitely have.
[02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:12.140]   And with that, my friend, I think we can bring this to a close.
[02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:14.380]   We will link to everything in the show notes,
[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:17.820]   all of these various things we've talked about, including the article,
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:22.500]   the very, very extensive article I wrote in 2016 and the link to the podcast
[02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:26.700]   with Rolf Potts, we'll link to all of those things and more in the show notes,
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:30.140]   but I don't want to omit one very important thing.
[02:54:30.140 --> 02:54:34.060]   And that is to mention Chris's podcast.
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:38.020]   And we didn't get to go into lessons from different guests,
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:40.860]   which I asked you to prepare. So maybe another time we'll do that,
[02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:44.460]   but I've listened to a couple of episodes, really enjoyed the,
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:49.220]   I listened to your first and your last. So at least on overcast,
[02:54:49.260 --> 02:54:53.380]   I listened to the first episode, which was with Lee Rowan,
[02:54:53.380 --> 02:54:55.660]   which was outstanding, really enjoyed it.
[02:54:55.660 --> 02:55:00.700]   Even though I'm not hugely obsessed with points and optimizing on that side,
[02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:02.980]   there were a lot of really good points.
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:05.140]   So I'm going to go refer to the show notes on that.
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:09.820]   And I listened to Andy Radcliffe, who's incredible.
[02:55:09.820 --> 02:55:12.900]   One of the co-founders of Benchmark Capital also,
[02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:16.700]   which is one of the most successful venture capital firms of all time.
[02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:21.500]   I think their initial fund, I learned this from the podcast had what 92 X returns.
[02:55:21.500 --> 02:55:24.980]   It's just bananas. And that's, that's an episode on investing,
[02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:25.940]   as you might imagine.
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:31.700]   And I'm listening currently to episode six on the psychology of money with
[02:55:31.700 --> 02:55:35.740]   Morgan household and enjoying that quite a lot. So the podcast is good.
[02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:39.380]   It's super solid. And I think you're off to the races, man.
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:42.660]   I don't have tons of critical feedback for you.
[02:55:42.660 --> 02:55:46.060]   I think you're doing a good job and it's really about keeping it interesting for
[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:47.140]   you and staying the course.
[02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:51.420]   But what else would you like to say about your podcast and where people can find
[02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:52.060]   it?
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:54.700]   I would just say, give it a listen and wherever you listen podcasts,
[02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:55.900]   which you're obviously doing right now.
[02:55:55.900 --> 02:56:00.140]   So just search for all the hacks and reach out if you have feedback and there's
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:01.540]   topics you want me to explore.
[02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:05.780]   All the hacks.com. Is that right? Yep. All the hacks.com.
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:10.060]   All the hacks.com. And this man knows of what he speaks.
[02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:14.540]   Chris is optimizer Supreme. And I don't say that lightly. It's,
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:19.140]   it's kind of mind boggling to me how methodical you are with optimizing so many
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:19.940]   areas of your life.
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:24.900]   So this is a person who walks the walk and I've
[02:56:24.900 --> 02:56:29.260]   seen it firsthand in many, many areas.
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:32.420]   So I encourage people to check it out. All the hacks.com we'll link to it in the
[02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:36.900]   show notes. And it is a good to spend time with you, Christopher.
[02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:40.900]   Yeah. Thank you for, thank you for co-hosting slash hosting this episode.
[02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:44.060]   Yeah. I can now, I guess I can put on my resume host of the Tim Ferriss show.
[02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:46.340]   You said it had to be you, but here we go.
[02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:52.660]   Tim, Tim, Chris, Chris, volume two. Thanks for tuning in everybody.
[02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:57.260]   All right. If you're still here,
[02:56:57.260 --> 02:57:01.180]   thank you so much for joining this really unique episode of all the hacks.
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:04.860]   I know I learned a ton from Tim and I'm already putting those learnings to good
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:08.220]   use to find some amazing guests to bring on all the hacks.
[02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:11.420]   I'll keep this outro short because this show was long.
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:14.500]   So if you haven't left a rating and review in the Apple podcast app,
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:17.580]   it would mean so much to me if you could. And if you want to get in touch,
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:20.860]   I'm Chris at all the hacks.com and at Hutchins on Twitter.
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:22.180]   Thank you so much.
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:26.540]   And see you next week for a conversation about travel points and miles with the
[02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:28.620]   points guy himself, Brian Kelly.
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:31.200]   (upbeat music)
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:39.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
