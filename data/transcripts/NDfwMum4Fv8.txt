[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   When we say gift cards, when you go into a store, you're buying a physical gift card.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.320]   But when you're, we talk about online deals, you're not necessarily
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.660]   buying a physical gift card.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.760]   So in the case of these apps, what you're really just getting are numbers and pins.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.380]   So if it's something that you can do just by copying and pasting numbers, then
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.020]   like, that's really appealing to people.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.480]   So pepper, as you mentioned, like that's been huge.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.700]   I sort of hesitate to talk too much about it just because like, you have to spend a
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.060]   lot of money in a short amount of time to get the really good deals from pepper.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.160]   And also who knows for how long pepper will continue to be like a
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.700]   really great place to get gift cards.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.460]   But yeah, it seems like every year or two, an app comes around where they're,
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.580]   they're losing money selling gift cards because they want to increase revenue.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.460]   They want to increase users, things like that.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.020]   And if somebody is willing to subsidize the product, you should always buy
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.700]   as much of that product as you can.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580]   And if it's a gift card, all the better.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.340]   Cause it's, it's like they're selling dollars for 50 cents.
