[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:14.880]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in chapter 6, and reading from verse 5 to verse 9.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.120]   Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:30.240]   and trembling, in singleness of your heart as unto Christ, not with eye service as men
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.640]   pleases, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with good
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.140]   will, doing service as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatsoever good thing
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.080]   any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:59.120]   And ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:08.520]   master also is in heaven; neither is there any respect of persons with him.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.440]   We come back to a further consideration of this most important and interesting statement.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   We began considering it last Sunday morning. It is this third example, which is given us
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.640]   by the apostle, of how we are to put into practice the general injunction of the twenty-first
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.520]   verse of the fifth chapter, where he says, "Submitting yourselves one to another in
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.960]   the fear of God." This is how people who are filled with the Spirit are to live. They
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.280]   are to live thus, submitting themselves one to another. Wives are to submit to husbands,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.880]   as we have seen. Children are to obey their parents. And here now, he tells those who
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.640]   are servants that they are to be obedient to them that are their masters according to
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.240]   the flesh. But, as we have been indicating, the apostle
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   always gives the other side as well. He has told husbands what their duties are to their
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   wives. He has told parents their duties and responsibilities as regards their children.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:24.560]   And here, he is very careful to have a word for the masters. You get this perfect balance
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   of the scripture. Now here, as we look at this particular injunction
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.240]   or application of the truth, we find ourselves, as I was indicating last Sunday morning, face
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   to face with a very great question, a very great problem. Because the apostle is here
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.560]   dealing with the condition of slaves. Servants means, literally, slaves. So we are looking
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.280]   at the great problem of slavery. But it is not only that, of course. In dealing with
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.200]   it in principle, as he does, the apostle obviously raises the whole question of these relationships
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.960]   of men one to another in terms of economics, working conditions, trade unionism. Yes, it
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.600]   even includes politics, social conditions in general, and, indeed, one's whole relationship
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.040]   to the state. Because the principle involved is that of a man who is in any position of
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.000]   subordination to another. And as the state is the employer of so many at the present
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.960]   time, the whole question of our relationship to the state is involved, all of us. So that
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   in the last analysis, the apostle is raising here in principle even the question of rebellion
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.800]   or revolution. Now, I need not take any of your time in reminding
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.960]   you again this morning that these problems are very practical and are vital to all of
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.000]   us. And certainly there are many Christians in many parts of the world this morning who
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   are having to face this very matter most acutely. There are countries where there are actual
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.880]   rebellions taking place, and about to take place. Where do the Christians come into all
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:28.360]   this? What is the governing principle which is to rule the attitude of a Christian to
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.800]   all these involved and complicated situations? Well, fortunately for us, the great apostle
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.680]   has troubled to work it out here in principle. And we have noticed this, that the approach
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.680]   is quite unique. You'll never find what you read here anywhere else. It's unlike every
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.920]   other teaching. And that is because, of course, it's Christian. It is written to people who
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.200]   are to be filled with the Spirit. It is written on the assumption that these people have been
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.760]   born again. But they are not like everybody else. They wear sometimes darkness. They are
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.560]   now light in the Lord. It assumes all that. This is not a letter written to the world.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.640]   It's not a newspaper article for everybody. It is a teaching that only Christian people
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   can understand, and obviously they are the only people, therefore, who can ever hope
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.520]   to put it into practice. It is peculiar and special and unique.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.960]   Well now, what have we seen? Well, the big thing that we find is this, that it is astonishing
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   to notice that comparatively little space is given to these great questions in the whole
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.560]   of the Bible. I reminded you of the passages in which you find these references, but there
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.800]   are comparatively few. Now, that is the most interesting and significant thing in and of
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:03.840]   itself, that this great big book should give such comparatively little space and attention
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.600]   to this problem that is constantly arising in the daily life of all people. And from
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.440]   that we drew two main deductions, and these are they. I'm saying all this because we can't
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.480]   follow the rest of the argument without holding this in our minds as background.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:32.120]   The Bible's primary concern is with our relationship to God. That doesn't mean that it isn't
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.040]   interested in our relationship to one another, but its primary interest, its essential emphasis
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.680]   always is in our relationship to God. Render, therefore, unto Caesar the things that are
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:54.520]   Caesar's and the thing that men forget, and to God the things that are God's. Now, everywhere
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.480]   the Bible puts its great emphasis just there. And the second principle is this, that the
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:10.400]   Bible views our life in this world as being but of secondary importance. The Bible teaches
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   us that we are but strangers and pilgrims here. Our home, our citizenship is in heaven,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.160]   so that everything that happens to us here, from the biblical standpoint, takes a secondary
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   place. Now, there, I say, are these two great controlling
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:35.680]   principles. And it is because of this that the Bible gives so little space and time and
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.300]   attention to the consideration of these many problems that are always crowding round and
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.900]   about us in our daily lives as Christians. The very fact that it gives such little attention
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.440]   is a vital part of the teaching. You see, all its emphasis is there. It is God. It is
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.760]   eternity. And this life and world and all its problems must always be viewed in the
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.880]   light of that. And from that I do this deduction. This, therefore, is the business and the preaching
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:14.000]   of the business and to be the practice of the Church. The business of the Church is
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.200]   not to deal directly, therefore, with these problems. She only deals with them indirectly.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.720]   The Church and her preaching are to do exactly what the Bible does itself. It must not spend
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.760]   the whole of its time in entering into these problems in detail. No, the business of the
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:42.480]   Church is to deal with the great general principles and to help men, therefore, in the light of
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.000]   them, to meet their particular problems and perplexities.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.680]   I can put it like this as a principle. The business of the Church is not to deal with
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:02.320]   conditions as such, but it is with the Christian's relationship to these conditions, which is
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.400]   a very different matter. Now, you see the importance of this great principle at the
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:16.000]   present time. But some people object at this point and say, "But what about your Old Testament
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.960]   prophets? Weren't they always dealing with these practical problems and conditions?"
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:31.080]   But the answer to that is quite simple. The nation of Israel was also the Church. There
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.600]   was no division between the State and the Church. The State and the Church were one.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.480]   The nation was the Church. So, as the prophets addressed their remarks to the nation, they
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:50.200]   are addressing their remarks to God's people, to the believers. So, the answer is perfectly
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:57.640]   simple and perfectly plain. The business of the Church always is to deal with conditions
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.720]   in the Church. And as the Church and State were one, it was their business to do so.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.240]   But the moment you come to the New Testament, you find an entirely different position. Here
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.320]   is the Church separated out of the world, bearing a relationship to the States, but
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.400]   not one with the States. And therefore, we must be guided by this great principle. There
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.960]   is no contradiction between the Old and the New. The attention is always given to the
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:34.840]   Church, to God's people, and to God's people in their relationship to him and as pilgrims
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:43.440]   of eternity. Now, the deduction we therefore draw is this,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:52.600]   that the Church's task primarily is to evangelize, is to bring people to a knowledge of God,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.360]   and then, having done that, to teach them how to live their life under God as his people.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:05.000]   Now that is the great task of the Church. But remember, her primary task with regard
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.600]   to the world that is outside is that of evangelism. The Church is not here to reform the world
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.160]   because the world cannot be reformed. The business of the Church is to evangelize, is
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.460]   to preach a gospel of salvation to men who are blinded by sin and under the dominion
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:29.120]   and the power of the devil. That is her primary task. And she must never do anything that
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:36.160]   militates against that primary task. Now I am suggesting to you that the moment
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.240]   the Church begins to enter into the details of politics and economics and so on, she is
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.520]   doing something that militates against her primary task of evangelism. Let me take one
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:55.480]   obvious instance. Take the case of the Church and Communism at the present time. Now my
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   contention is that it is not the business of the Christian Church to be denouncing Communism.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   She is spending a great deal of her time in doing that very thing. Why do I say it is
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.960]   wrong? Well, I say it is wrong for this reason, that the primary task of the Church is to
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:21.120]   evangelize Communists. It is to open their eyes, to bring them to conviction and to conversion.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.920]   We are to regard all men, whatever their position, whether they are Communists or Capitalists
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.240]   or anything you may like to call them, we regard them all as sinners and equally as
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:37.120]   sinners. They are all lost, they are all damned, they all need to be converted, they all need
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.520]   to be born again. So the Church looks on at all this in an entirely different way from
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.680]   everybody else. And therefore I suggest to you that if the Church spends the whole of
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:55.440]   her time in denouncing Communism, she is more or less shutting the door of evangelism amongst
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.480]   Communists as firmly as she can possibly do. The Communists say, "Oh, your Christianity
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   is just anti-Communist. I am not going to listen to that message, and therefore you
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.320]   can't evangelize it." No, no, the Church is not meant to deal with these positions
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:18.760]   directly. Her task is to preach her gospel to all and sundry, whatever they are, to bring
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.560]   them to a knowledge of Christ. She is to keep from interfering in details and in conditions,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.880]   lest her primary task of evangelism be impeded and hindered. And she herself is shutting
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.000]   the door against the very thing that she claims that she should be doing.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.200]   Well, now that, I say, is what one deduces in general from this teaching. And we are
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.520]   always to do what the apostle does here, what we saw our Lord himself did, and what all
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.200]   the writers and teachers in the Bible do, whether it is the Old Testament or the New.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.280]   Now then, what are the principles, therefore, that we deduce from all this? Well, let me
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.040]   put them to you. And again, let me ask you to be patient, because the whole truth is
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.800]   not going to be in any one of these principles. If I could have put it all into one, I would
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.600]   have done so. But it can't be done. I've got to give you a series of points, therefore.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.480]   And some of them at first may appear to contradict others. But be patient. Don't allow your
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.440]   prejudices to govern you. Don't be in too much of a hurry. Let's look at them one
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   by one.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.200]   Here's the first principle. Christianity, obviously, does not abolish our relationship
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:40.120]   to social, political, and economic conditions. It doesn't abolish them. Now, why is it
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.160]   necessary to say that? Well, because many of the early Christians thought that the fact
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.080]   that they had become Christian abolished all that. And there are many people who still
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:57.320]   think the same thing. There are many people who seem to think that, and as the early Christians
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:03.000]   did, that when a man becomes a Christian, he no longer is bound to his wife, who is
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.880]   still not a Christian. That's why Paul had to write the seventh chapter of the first
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.560]   epistle to the Corinthians. It was happening on both sides. They were arguing like this.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.920]   They said, "We got married when we were pagans in unbelief. But now, of course, we're
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.960]   Christians. We see everything differently. My wife isn't a Christian. Well, I can't
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.720]   be bound any longer. It's injuring my Christian life." They were tending to walk out and
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:33.640]   to leave the unconverted wife. And many converted wives were doing exactly the same thing. But
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.480]   the apostle has to write to them and tell them not to do that. There were children who
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.280]   were doing the same thing. They'd been converted. Their parents hadn't. They said, "Of course,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.600]   our parents no longer have any control over us. They don't understand. They're pagans.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.240]   They're not Christians. And therefore, of course, we now don't submit to them any longer."
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:57.360]   But you do, says Paul. And so it was with this question of service in their relationship
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.240]   to masters. And indeed, we find in the second epistle to the Thessalonians in the third
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.280]   chapter that there were some Christians who even stopped working. They said, "Now, of
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.760]   course, we are in a new realm and we are looking for the return of the Savior." So they stopped
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.640]   working and they were just looking to the heavens and waiting for the appearance of
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.320]   the Lord. And the apostle has to tell them quite plainly that if a man will not work,
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:33.440]   neither shall he eat. But that's a complete misunderstanding of Christianity. And it all
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.240]   comes up in the same way in connection with this relationship of servants and masters.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.160]   You see, the tendency is to say at once, "We're all equal now." Doesn't the apostle Paul
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.640]   say, "There is neither Jew, nor Gentile, barbarian, nor Scythian, bond, nor free, nor
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   male, nor female. We're all equal. There's no difference between men and women any longer.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.560]   Let them be ministers and preach. Let them be this and that in the church. There's no
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.960]   difference," doesn't Paul say, "no longer male nor female." Now, that's a complete
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.240]   misunderstanding, of course. What the apostle is saying is that there is no difference from
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.200]   the standpoint of the possibility of salvation. But that doesn't do away with the orders
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:23.880]   of society. It doesn't abolish the inherent, essential difference between a man and a woman,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.960]   or between these various other relationships. Now, you will find in the most interesting
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.160]   way, in the history of the church, how people have constantly dropped into this error. Take
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   the sect known as the Anabaptists, that arose in the 16th century. The Anabaptists fell
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.240]   into this trap, you see. They said, "We're all equal now. We have nothing to do with
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.200]   the state." So they tried to cut themselves right off, to segregate themselves from the
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   world in every respect. There are still people who tend to do that. They think it's wrong
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   for a Christian to pay rates and taxes. As I indicated last Sunday, they think it's wrong
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.600]   for a Christian to take part in politics and things like that. And they don't vote at the
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:11.160]   elections and so on. Now, all that is just a failure to see this first principle, that
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:18.620]   the fact that we have become Christian does not dissolve nor abolish our relationship
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:25.880]   to the state, and to masters, and to social, political, and economic conditions.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.560]   Well, no, there's no need to argue about this. It's all here. You see, what the Apostle is
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:38.920]   saying here is this, that our becoming Christian does not even change the whole question of
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:46.040]   slavery. It doesn't abolish slavery, according to what he says here. He doesn't tell these
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.680]   slaves that now they're Christians that the former conditions are abolished. He says the
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:58.880]   exact opposite. The slaves are to go on as they were before, but with this new standpoint
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:06.540]   which he teaches them. And you remember the epistle to Philemon, obviously teaches exactly
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.360]   the same thing. But let me give you what is perhaps the classical
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:19.480]   statement on all this from 1 Corinthians 7. Let me read verses 20 to 24. "Let every man
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:30.080]   abide in the same calling wherein he was called. Art thou called being a slave, a servant?
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:38.320]   Care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. For he that is called
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:47.240]   in the Lord being a servant, a slave, is the Lord's freeman. Likewise also he that is called
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:56.580]   being free is Christ's slave, servant. Ye are bought with a price. Be not ye the servant's
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:06.560]   slaves of men. Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with God."
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.640]   Now that is the classical statement in a way on this whole matter. "Art thou called being
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:20.360]   a slave? Care not for it. Don't let that be the big thing in your life. Don't become anxious
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.440]   over that. Don't let that absorb all your attention. Don't let that come into the center.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:32.280]   Care not for it. But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather."
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.920]   Now then, that is why I start by laying down that first great general principle, that the
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:48.960]   fact that we have become Christian does not abolish our relationship to social, political,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:59.280]   and economic conditions. But now let me go on to a second principle which is most astonishing.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.760]   Christianity not only does not change our relationship to these conditions, it does
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:14.440]   not even condemn such things as slavery directly as being sinful.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.240]   Now you realize at once that this has been a great stumbling block to many people, and
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.960]   particularly during this last century. But it is our business to expand the Scriptures.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.400]   People say slavery is patently wrong and sinful. Christianity must of necessity denounce that.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.600]   They are saying the same thing about various other things at the present time, which I
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.760]   needn't mention. They say, "But it's obvious. Everybody can see that, even a man who isn't
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.040]   a Christian, a man who's got a grain of a sense of fairness and righteousness and a
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.880]   view of men and the dignity of men, he must see at once that it's altogether wrong."
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.560]   And yet, you know, the plain fact is that the Bible does not condemn slavery as such
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:02.360]   directly. It doesn't do it. If it ever did do it, Paul would do it here. But he doesn't
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:09.680]   do it. He doesn't do it in writing to Philemon. He doesn't do it anywhere. Our Lord didn't
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   do it.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:17.280]   Now, this is something that the natural men simply cannot understand at all. And the rationalists
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.400]   of today, these critics of Christianity, they think that they have here an unanswerable
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:29.920]   point. Of course, the simple answer to them is this, that they've never even begun to
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:39.080]   see the two great controlling principles we've already laid down. They cannot see that it
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:46.960]   is a man's relationship to God that matters fundamentally, and that once a man has seen
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.880]   that, everything else becomes different to him, even slavery. Though he be a slave, he
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.920]   doesn't see it as he did before. He is Christ's free man.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.040]   You see, it is because these men are blind to the supernatural, blind to the spiritual.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.720]   They see nothing but this world. They see nothing but this life. And, of course, they're
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   bound by that. And it vitiates the whole of their thinking. Christian thinking is unlike
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:24.080]   natural thinking at every point. And that is why, to me, there is nothing which is more
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.760]   tragic in the world this morning as the way in which men calling themselves Christians
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:37.360]   can join in and participate in the activities of these rationalist non-Christians of the
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:46.080]   present time. The whole approach, the whole thinking, is entirely different. Now, we must
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:56.640]   note this. Christianity does not even condemn such a thing as slavery, directly, as being
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.360]   sinful. And that is why, no doubt, slavery persisted throughout the centuries.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:09.640]   Well, it's a very important matter for us to hold a firm grasp on, in order that we
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:16.040]   may understand this teaching. But now let me go on to my third principle, which is this.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.280]   Christianity, I say, in the second principle, does not even condemn such a thing as slavery.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   But thirdly, it does not condone slavery either. Neither does it justify it. Now, this is equally
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:37.280]   important. Here again has been a very frequent source of misunderstanding. There have been
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.760]   people who have thought that Christianity is nothing but a kind of justification of
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:49.440]   the status quo. I am amazed at the blindness of people who are falling into the Roman Catholic
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:56.160]   trap at the present time. Roman Catholicism is fighting Communism and is inviting all
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.360]   Protestants to come and join with her, all who use the name of Christian, against that.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.960]   And so many Christians are falling into the trap. They don't see, you see, that Roman
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:14.200]   Catholicism is mainly concerned to defend her own particular form of totalitarianism.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:20.680]   It's simply one totalitarian system against another. It is defending the status quo. Christianity
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.920]   never does that. It doesn't condemn slavery, but it doesn't condone slavery. There's
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:36.720]   no word here of condonation. It doesn't justify slavery. What is its attitude, then,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.320]   you say? Well, I've already told you. What Christianity is interested in is the way in
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.080]   which a Christian slave behaves himself towards his master, and how the man who owns a slave
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.480]   treats his slave. That's what it does. It doesn't deal with the question of slavery
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.200]   per se. Now, you've got your principle, I trust. I don't want to mention some of the
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.360]   modern applications of this at the present time. But, you see, the tragedy is today the
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.640]   Christian church is spending the whole of her time in dealing with these things directly.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.800]   They're always preaching about them and talking, interfering and organizing their processions
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:17.280]   in this and in other lands, dealing with the problem directly. The Bible never does that.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.840]   But what it is very concerned about is how the Christians on the two sides of the problem
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.360]   and the situation conduct themselves. Now, this is really very vital teaching. So let
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.960]   me put it to you like this. Christianity, I say, is not concerned to condone this. It
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.000]   isn't here merely as a defense of the status quo. We hear such a lot today about defending
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.520]   Western civilization against this attack. It's all wrong. I'm not interested in Western
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.840]   civilization. I'm interested in the kingdom of God. And I'm as anxious that men behind
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.120]   the Iron Curtain should be saved this morning as men on this side of the Iron Curtain. We
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.720]   must not take up a position of antagonism against men whom we want to win for Christ.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.280]   If you spend the whole of your time attacking, you'll never win. That's why I never preach
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.680]   a temperance sermon. I want to see drunkards converted. Our business isn't to denounce
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.400]   drink. It is to get the poor drunkard to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that will deliver
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.760]   him. But the church so constantly is mistaking the teaching and going into these things in
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.440]   need. So I put it like this. It isn't the business of the Christian church to preach
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:39.400]   the divine right of kings. There was a time when the church did that, you know. James
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.520]   I was a very astute man. He said, "No bishop, no king." So they stood together, and the
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:53.700]   church became a defense of the divine right of kings. But she'd abrogated her whole position.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.520]   She was being false to her teaching. That isn't the business of the Christian church.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.420]   The business of the Christian church is not to defend any system, masters or men or anybody
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:15.660]   else. Christianity, I say, while it doesn't condemn slavery, it doesn't condone slavery.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:21.720]   Its attitude is this detached one, which looks on and is concerned about the principles,
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:28.840]   which leads me to my fourth principle, which is this one. The Bible is concerned, Christianity
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:37.600]   is concerned, is as to how the Christian should react to these things, and how he is to live
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:44.400]   in the midst of all this. Now that is the essence of the teaching. Here it is here.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   Paul, when he comes to servants and masters, doesn't now begin to give his views as a Christian
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.020]   on the question of slavery. No, no. Servants, he says, be obedient to them that are your
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.420]   masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:06.600]   as unto Christ, not with eyes of... and so on. In other words, his one interest is, how
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.740]   are you to conduct yourself as a Christian slave? How are you to behave? And likewise
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:19.860]   with the master. You masters do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening. Doesn't
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.780]   tell them to give them all up, but he tells, don't threaten them, don't be unkind, don't
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:30.660]   be cruel, neither knowing that your master also is in heaven, and neither is there respect
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:38.100]   of persons with him. There it is. And did you notice it in the first epistle of Peter
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:45.980]   chapter 2? Servants, obey your masters, and you notice, not only to the good and gentle,
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:53.980]   but also to the frail. He doesn't tell them to rise up and to agitate against... he isn't
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:00.340]   interested in that. The Bible never does that. But it is very interested in the fact that
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.060]   this Christian man is not going to abuse his position. Not using your liberty, he says,
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:13.420]   as a cloak for maliciousness. That's the danger. That the Christian may use his Christian position
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:20.300]   as a cloak for malice that is in his own heart. It's often been done. Things have been done
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.100]   in the name of Christianity that should never have been done at all. And the tragedy is
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:30.660]   this, it does harm to Christianity. It's been done on both sides. It is because men and
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:36.340]   masters forget that their duty is to God, their master who is in heaven, that the problems
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:45.700]   have always arisen. Now, we could easily dilate on all this. There are many people today who
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:56.020]   say that the working classes, so-called, are outside the church, because the Victorian
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:05.900]   church was a church of the masters. It said very frequently, "You go to the mining valleys
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:10.940]   of any part of this Great Britain of ours, and you'll find you'll be told that regularly."
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:19.140]   They say, "You know, last century, it was the same boss in the works and in the chapel.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.820]   Your head deacon was the manager of the works." And they say, "That's why we rebelled against
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:33.700]   all this." Now, you know that that happened more or less in Russia. The monarchy in Russia
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:41.740]   had got under the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, with that evil man Rasputin.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:49.460]   And the Russian people identified that horrible abuse with Christianity, and they threw what
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:54.540]   they thought was Christianity overboard. But they were doing nothing of the sort. They
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.980]   were throwing overboard a horrible perversion of Christianity that isn't Christianity at
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:08.040]   all. But it's so often been done. It's been done on both sides. And it is very largely
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.340]   because both sides have failed to implement and to understand the principle that the Apostle
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:21.580]   is enunciating here. Our business, I say, is to relate ourselves correctly, primarily,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:27.420]   to the positions in which we find ourselves. And of course, in Romans 13, you've got exactly
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:32.180]   the same thing. There, the Apostle tells them to be subject to the powers that be. "For
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.500]   the powers that be," he says, "are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.300]   power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist shall receive to themselves
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.460]   damnation." Now, that was written to people who were under the power of the Emperor Nero
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:55.420]   of all men. But that's exactly what the Christian is to do. His primary concern is to be a servant
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:03.140]   of God and of Christ, whatever his position, whatever his circumstances and conditions.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.940]   Whether he is master or servant, whether he's king or subject, doesn't matter. They're all
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:13.860]   to submit themselves together and to see that in every way they are behaving as Christian
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:21.180]   people. They are not to be primarily concerned about the situations and the conditions as
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:31.500]   such. Their concern is, as pilgrims of eternity, as strangers and pilgrims, to be true to their
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   Master, to be preparing for their everlasting hope.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.580]   Well, now I say that that is true on the two sides, which brings me to my fifth and last
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:51.740]   principle, which is this one. Somebody may ask, "Well, then, what about improving conditions?"
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:59.020]   Somebody may say, "Are you not, by saying all that, simply taking up, after all, a defense
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:05.900]   of the status quo?" You say you're not doing that, but in effect you are doing that. You
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:12.140]   are saying that the Christian is not to be concerned about the conditions, but that his
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:19.180]   interest is to be in his behavior in the conditions. How do we answer that question? Well, the answer,
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:26.060]   it seems to me, is quite plain. It's this, that it is never the business of the Church
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:35.780]   to be concerned about improving conditions. Her business always is to be laying down these
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:45.100]   particular principles. She should never attack directly the circumstances and conditions.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:53.460]   I say that, as I am reminding you, because that is the attitude of the Bible itself.
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:59.860]   But at the same time, that does not mean that the individual Christian, as a citizen of
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:07.940]   a country, should not be concerned about improving conditions. Now, there, it seems to me, is
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:16.220]   the dividing line. The individual Christian is never to take the law into his own hands.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:22.020]   He is never to act as an individual. But that does not mean that, as a citizen of the country
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:30.260]   to which he belongs, he is not entitled to take part in improving the circumstances and
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.260]   conditions.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:42.820]   So, you see, it works like this. This great Christian message is primarily concerned to
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   produce Christians. It preaches its gospel. It convicts men of sin. It calls them to Jesus'
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:36:00.100]   blood. It brings them to this Word by which they can be born again by the power of the
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:07.860]   Spirit. It changes men. Then, having changed them in that way, it then goes on to teach
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:15.500]   them these great principles. Now, that is the direct task and business of the Church.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.660]   But as she does that, she is indirectly doing something else. She is obviously influencing
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:30.140]   the whole personality of such people. She is influencing their mind, their thinking,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:37.620]   their understanding, and their everything. And the moment that begins to happen to men,
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.180]   they begin to see things in a different way, and they begin to act.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:48.300]   Now, let me show, by means of an illustration, what I am saying. Take the effect, for instance,
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:55.700]   of the evangelical awakening of two hundred years ago. Prior to that, the common people
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:04.340]   of this country were ignorant. They were illiterate. They were living a life of sin and of squalor.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.460]   You can read in the secular history books and get the facts for yourself. There were
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:20.380]   no schools, comparatively speaking. It was ignorance, illiteracy, gross and foul sin.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:27.940]   What happened? What produced the change? Why were things different last century and still
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:36.020]   more so this century? Was it because the Christian Church set out in a great social and political
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:44.420]   campaign? And the answer is that it wasn't. That isn't what happened at all. There were
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:49.020]   always men in the Church who were trying to do such things, but it never led to anything
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:56.940]   at all. Well, what produced the change? Oh, I can tell you what produced the change. The
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:07.220]   acclaiming, passionate evangelism of men like George Whitefield and the Westleys and others
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:13.260]   was the thing that transformed the situation. What did they preach about? What did Whitefield
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:21.140]   preach about when he began to preach to those miners outside Bristol? What was his preaching
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:28.260]   to them? Did he talk to them about their social conditions, about their wages, about the hours
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:35.780]   of their work? Did he agitate amongst them to change all this and to rise up? Of course,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:44.900]   he did nothing of the kind. What Whitefield preached to those men was this. He brought
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:52.140]   them to see that they were sinners in the sight of an angry God. He preached to them
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.900]   about their souls, not about their bodies, not about their circumstances and conditions.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:04.820]   He preached to them about their souls, and that led to their conversion. And the same
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.340]   thing happened everywhere where these men went and preached. They were always dealing
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:14.260]   with men as men, men as souls, and these men were changed. They became Christians. They
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.620]   were born again. What was the result of that? Well, they began to use their minds. They
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:26.700]   hadn't used them before. They lived to drink, to gamble, to indulge in their cruel sports,
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.060]   cockfighting and things like that. But now, having been awakened spiritually, the whole
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.460]   men became awakened, and they found they'd got minds. The first thing they wanted was
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.140]   to read the Bible, but they couldn't read, so they asked if they might be taught how
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:45.420]   to read. Not in order that they might set up political societies and associations, but
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:51.980]   that they might read the Bible. And so they were taught to read. And thus, you see, they
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   were awakened and enlightened, and they began to realize the truth about men and men's
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.780]   personality and his dignity. And of course, having gone that far, they went further. They
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.340]   began then to look at their circumstances and conditions. They began to say, "Are
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.620]   the conditions in which we're living fair and just and right?" And they came to the
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.220]   conclusion that they were not. And they proceeded to take measures to change them. And that's
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.140]   perfectly all right. That's entirely within the bounds of the scriptural teaching. You
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.100]   see, this teaching doesn't denounce slavery, but it doesn't condone it. It doesn't say
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.740]   rise up and change. It doesn't say maintain the status quo. It doesn't say either. It
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:39.220]   deals with a man. And then the man, under the influence of this teaching, and with this
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:50.620]   new understanding, he himself begins to examine the position and to deal with it.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:41:00.820]   In other words, let me sum it up like this. The Church does not commend any of these changes.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:09.220]   It's never done so. There is not a word in the Bible which tells men to abolish slavery,
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:15.420]   and yet we know that it was Christian men who did that eventually. That's exactly how
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:20.740]   it happened. That is exactly in accordance with this teaching. There's no commend to
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.820]   do it. It doesn't deal with these things directly. And yet, when men become Christians,
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.620]   they begin to think. And they think on both sides. I've given you an example of how the
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:36.220]   men began to think, but look on the other side. William Wilberforce, a wealthy man born
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:44.100]   in the lap of luxury. Why did he become concerned about the question of slavery? There's only
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:51.180]   one answer to the question. It was his conversion. Because William Wilberforce underwent a conversion
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:42:00.420]   that was as radical as that of the drunken miners outside Bristol. Same thing exactly.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:10.460]   Here was a man who was entirely changed. And from being a society fop, became a great reformer.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.140]   And as his mind became Christian, he began to look. And he said, "This is not right.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:20.700]   I must deal with this." Not because he'd got to commend, but because of his general
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.820]   thinking and his general Christian outlook. That is the way.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:33.340]   Exactly the same with the Earl of Shaftesbury and the factory acts of the last century.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:40.300]   There was another man who underwent an evangelical conversion. An aristocrat of the aristocrats,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:47.860]   born in the lap of luxury. But because his mind had been renewed in Christ, he began
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:53.700]   to see everything differently. And he developed a concern. The same with Dr. Barnardo. It's
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:59.740]   the same with all these men. Well, now, if only we could see this. That is how it's done.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:05.460]   It isn't the task of the Church. And you see, the tragedy is that while the Church is talking
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:11.340]   about these particular problems, and is dealing directly with politics and economics and social
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:19.540]   conditions, what is happening? No Christians are being produced. And because no Christians
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:25.300]   are being produced, the conditions and the problems are not being dealt with. It is as
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.660]   the Church produces Christians that she changes the position.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.460]   Now, in a most interesting way, I came across a very fascinating illustration of this very
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:42.340]   point I'm making only last Friday morning. I read in an article a thing that I had known
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:51.380]   before, but which had escaped my memory. The great Charles Simeon, Anglican clergyman in
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:44:01.380]   Cambridge, as you know, from about 1790 to the early 1830s. I suppose in many ways the
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:13.240]   biggest influence upon the Anglican Church up until 1860 of any single man. A man whose
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:19.380]   influence has persisted even well beyond that. Now, the thing that I was reminded of in the
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:28.280]   article was this. Charles Simeon was preaching in Cambridge throughout the entire period
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:39.540]   of the Napoleonic War, from about 1790 to 1815. And during the whole of that 25 years,
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:49.200]   with all the crises and the alarms and fears, Charles Simeon didn't preach once on the
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:55.100]   Napoleonic Wars, not a single occasion. And he was criticized bitterly and severely. Why
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.980]   wasn't he dealing with the facts? Why wasn't he dealing with things that were relevant?
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:04.940]   Why wasn't he taking up current affairs and dealing with them as he should be doing?
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.980]   There were many others who were doing that. Who were they? Nobody knows. Their names are
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:17.300]   long since forgotten. These topical preachers, they were popular in their age. Nobody knows
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:22.620]   about them now. Nobody even knows their names. They had no effect upon the conditions at
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:27.680]   all. They made not the slightest difference to Napoleon or to the Napoleonic Wars or to
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.460]   anybody else. But they were preaching topical sermons, dealing with the situation. And their
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:41.600]   names were in the papers and in the headlines. Marvelous. It led to nothing.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:47.780]   The man who really influenced the life of the nation was Charles Simeon. He did it in
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:55.700]   the biblical way, which is indirect. He did it by preaching the gospel and changing men.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.500]   The church can't change conditions. She's not meant to change conditions. And the moment
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:06.380]   she tries to, she's shutting the door of evangelism. If I attack communism, the communists are
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.540]   on defense and are not going to listen to my gospel. They won't even give it a hearing.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:15.580]   I mustn't do that. I mustn't attack any of these things. I don't care what they are.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:21.300]   My concern is with the souls of men, to produce Christians. The larger the number of Christians,
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.900]   the greater will be the volume of Christian thinking. And it is the business of individual
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:31.980]   Christians, then, to enter Parliament, if you like, with Wilberforce, or to speak in
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:38.060]   the House of Lords with the Earl of Shaftesbury, to go on to a local council, to act as citizens.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:43.580]   You are still citizens. Act accordingly. Don't let this absorb you. Don't let this be the
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.260]   great thing. That's been the curse.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:54.140]   I believe the state of our churches today, as I have said, has been largely responsible
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:47:03.900]   for that. I'm old enough to remember a time in this country when the essential difference
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:13.460]   between church and chapel was the difference between Toryism and liberalism. It was the
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:19.940]   one difference. Toryism, defending the status quo, that's the Church of England, we were
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:26.940]   told. And on the other side, non-conformity, liberalism. What's this? Changing the rule
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:33.540]   condition, getting better conditions. You are preacher politicians. Oh, how much those
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:41.980]   men will have to answer for. As I put it last Sunday, the preacher politician is as reprehensible
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.140]   as your bishops and archbishops in the House of Lords, who are intervening directly in
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:52.660]   politics and economics and social affairs. They are sidetracking the people's attention
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:59.660]   from the message of the Word of God. They are not producing Christians. And it is because
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:05.420]   there are so few Christians in the world that things are as they are.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:13.780]   Now, there are the five principles, it seems to me, controlling this great matter. And
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:20.860]   what we must go on to do next Sunday, God willing, is this, is to see how the Scripture
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:32.260]   gives us further guidance yet on implementing these five principles. We need guidance even
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:41.180]   about them. And thank God it is here for us. But if we miss the main thing, the central
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:47.100]   matter, any further consideration will be a pure waste of time.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:55.300]   My friend, I ask you again in the name of God, what is your primary concern this morning?
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:07.180]   Is it the condition that you are in, or is it your relationship to God and eternity?
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:12.140]   If you are consumed by your present conditions, if you are agitated and excited and feeling
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:18.100]   passionately and speaking strongly and condemning others on one side or the other, I say you
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:29.060]   are already outside the New Testament position. The Christian's one burning concern is his
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:38.060]   relationship to God and to heaven and eternity. And because that is his burning concern, he
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:45.940]   looks on at everything else as being secondary. He looks on at it coolly and quietly, realising
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:52.740]   that his first business is to be related to it all as a Christian, different from all
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:50:02.380]   the others, and then and then only. Does he begin to consider whether, as a citizen involved
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:10.820]   in all these, he should be doing something about them directly, changing, improving,
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.020]   maintaining, whatever his point of view may chance to be?
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:26.500]   But the final and the ultimate question is always this. My Master who is in heaven, whether
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:34.900]   I am servant, slave, or whether I am master, whether I am owner, are we submitting and
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:45.940]   bowing before him? Amen. We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin
