[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.240]   - All right, what do we have next?
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.840]   - Okay, our next question is about weekend planning.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.040]   - Weekend planning, okay.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.520]   - Hi, Cal, my name is Lucia.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.480]   I'm a law student from Spain.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.000]   Thank you for your writing on your student advice.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.640]   It has helped me a lot.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   My question is this,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.520]   you recommend that people don't time block their weekends
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.360]   because it may lead to burnout.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.080]   However, we students often need to work on weekends
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.360]   in order to live up to the study load.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720]   How do you recommend that we approach weekend planning?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.820]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.720]   - For a student, what I would rely on
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.320]   is my autopilot schedule philosophy,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.580]   which is where you figure out all the work
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.100]   that regularly needs to be done,
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.160]   and you get the days and times
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.840]   in which that work is actually accomplished.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.960]   So I always use whatever Thursday mornings
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.080]   is when I do the problem set that's due on Friday,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   and I do my lab write-up right after my lab on Monday.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.120]   I have a two-hour window
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.960]   where I just stay in the science library right there,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.280]   and I do the lab write-up that's due every week.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.040]   And so you just have fixed on your schedule,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.760]   here's the times when this work gets done,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.600]   this work I know that always has to happen.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.180]   So that gives you a realistic vision
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.640]   of how much do I really have to do,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000]   and where does it fit?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.280]   And now if you're already filling that up,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.000]   autopilot the weekends.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.840]   So you might have autopilot things scheduled
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.880]   on the weekends, right?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.320]   So I don't have to think about it,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.440]   I'm working on the weekend,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   but I don't have to think about when or how I do it,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.040]   this is just what I do on Sunday afternoon,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   this is what I do on Saturday morning.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.600]   So when you're building your autopilot schedule as a student,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.480]   feel free to just use the weekends as well.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.200]   And this is different than time blocking.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.100]   Autopilot scheduling is different than time blocking
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.000]   because you just get used to,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.540]   I always do this work on this point.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.020]   And that's very different than I'm wrangling a whole day,
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.460]   beat by beat what I'm doing,
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.500]   I have to keep turning my attention
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.340]   from one thing to another,
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.740]   a complicated intricate schedule
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.940]   where you're locked in until you're done.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.040]   Now on the weekend, it's like, look,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.020]   I do Sunday mornings and Saturday afternoons,
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.580]   I just always do that, I go to the library,
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.700]   I don't have to think about it,
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.060]   it's not gonna burn you out the same way.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.840]   So you're right to note that students often
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.300]   do make use of the weekends,
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.660]   but let your autopilot schedule do a lot of that work.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.200]   Now, what about the one-time things, papers and exams,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680]   studying for exams, writing papers?
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.240]   For that, what I used to recommend in my books on this,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.880]   and also my writing on the Study Hacks blog,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.760]   is that you are going to create a plan for prep
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.200]   and execution for these one-time big things
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.020]   at least a month in advance.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.640]   And you figure out what really needs to be done
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.040]   to study for an exam,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.900]   what is gonna be involved in writing this paper?
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160]   And you get that work onto your calendar far in advance.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   And I would even suggest,
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   when I used to talk about this to students,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   I would say at the beginning of every semester,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.460]   go through your syllabus for each class,
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.040]   find a major one-time things,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.160]   find the exams, find the papers,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.760]   go back one month from each
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.240]   and put a note on your calendar that says,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.720]   make a plan for this.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.920]   So you do that at the beginning of the semester.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.040]   Now, as you're going through your semester,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.280]   executing your autopilot schedule, everything's fine,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   you're not time blocking every minute of your day,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.760]   you're just executing the schedule
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.120]   that's the same every day, every week.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.400]   And when you get to this note that says,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.280]   hey, time to start thinking about the midterm,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.920]   then you make a plan and you put that work on your calendar
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.980]   like doctor's appointments or other classes.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.680]   And now you're back to just say, I'm executing.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.840]   Autopilot schedule, oh, my autopilot schedule plus today,
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.360]   I have a block of time on my calendar, so let me do that.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.920]   Oh, today I only have it Saturday,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.800]   I have my Saturday afternoon
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.920]   where I always work on my CS problem set,
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.740]   but you know what?
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.920]   This Saturday I have a study session in the morning
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.320]   on my calendar because I have a midterm coming up,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.680]   so let me just do that too.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   And when you're starting a month out
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.120]   and really spreading this stuff out,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   what you avoid is this thing is due on Monday,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.240]   it's Saturday morning,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.060]   I now have to work all day and all night
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.720]   and all day the next day and all day the next night
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.680]   to try to get something done
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   because you're spreading work out.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.860]   So you have plenty of breathing time,
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.260]   plenty of time to recharge.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.160]   And it does not feel the same.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   An autopilot schedule augmented
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   with these pre-planned sessions for papers and exams
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.880]   does not feel the same as let's say my situation
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.480]   where I will say, okay, I have eight hours I'm working today
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.800]   and I need to get everything out of those minutes.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.440]   Let's go.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   Because as a student,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.120]   you do not have that chronic overload issue
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.020]   of people are just piling work on you,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.860]   you have more in your plate
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.240]   than you could ever imagine actually doing.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.800]   No, you can actually wrap your arms
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   around your work as a student.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   You autopilot schedule the regular stuff,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.160]   you pre-plan the one-time stuff.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.600]   If that's too crowded, get an easier schedule,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.000]   make sure you don't have too many extracurriculars,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.440]   you can control this.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.120]   And it's not gonna be nearly as stressful
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.000]   as time-block planning,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.500]   even if this work is happening on weekdays
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   and weekends.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.840]   The good news about that question,
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.240]   that caller we should say,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.640]   is that she's thinking about this.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.280]   That's the biggest issue with college kids in these issues
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.040]   and with student stress in college
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.760]   is that most students that are doing the traditional
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.020]   I'm 19 doing a four-year residential college,
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.600]   those type of students is they don't wanna hear it.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.320]   I don't wanna hear study advice.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.420]   It's gonna make me uncool or something like that.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.220]   I'm fine, I can just do it.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.220]   And it's so needlessly stressful and overwhelming.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.260]   College, if you do it right,
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.380]   if you keep your schedule reasonable
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.060]   and don't do the 70 extracurricular nonsense
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.660]   and don't do the triple major nonsense
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.580]   and you autopilot schedule and pre-plan your exams
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.220]   and papers, you don't have to work at night.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.780]   And you rarely have a busy day.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.860]   It's not that much work.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.820]   It all changes when you get out there in the real world
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.800]   if you follow and have an ambitious, difficult job.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.720]   So it doesn't have to be that hard.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.380]   But the main thing is thinking,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.320]   I'm actually going to be systematic
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.920]   about how I approach my job as a student.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.940]   That's the zero to one binary for college life
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.440]   that makes all the difference.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.280]   (upbeat music)
