[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.640]   the fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.320]   The epistle to the Ephesians chapter six and the first part of verse fourteen.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.440]   Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.840]   Stand therefore having girded about your loins with truth.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.600]   We've reached this stage at which we are now beginning to consider the particular separate
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:44.240]   portions of this whole armor of God which the apostle has been telling us we must put
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:53.240]   on in the strength which the Lord supplies if we are truly to stand against the viles
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.240]   of the devil and wrestle successfully against the principalities and the powers and the
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:07.120]   rulers of the darkness of this world and the spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.520]   Now we looked at this exhortation, this particular exhortation, in a general manner last Sunday
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.960]   morning, the girdle of truth.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.080]   He starts with this because this is the vital thing in getting ready for action.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.480]   We gird ourselves for action.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.240]   That's become a proverbial expression reminding us that there is nothing more vital in preparing
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.920]   for action and especially for warfare than to put on the girdle.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.960]   We've seen how it is quite foundational in that respect.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.000]   And then we went on to begin our consideration of what is meant by girding on the truth.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.320]   This is of course obviously the very essence of this matter.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   And we suggested that it stands here for the truth in general, the Christian faith, the
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.320]   Christian outlook.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   So what the apostle is really telling us is that we must be governed by the truth.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.760]   We must know it, we must possess it, and it must possess us.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.280]   So that all our thinking, all our reasoning, our whole outlook, all our actions, are governed
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   and determined by the truth.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.160]   That is what makes us Christians of course, that we are in that position, that unlike
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.480]   those who are not Christian, we are governed by this particular outlook, by this particular
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.280]   teaching.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.360]   And what girding on the truth means is that we make certain of it, that we know what it
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.880]   is, careful always to be guided by it.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.760]   Now this is the most important matter.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.880]   It's a lesson we all find so difficult to learn.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   The danger is to live our lives in compartments.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.120]   That you believe in Christ for salvation and you accept that, then you may go on and live
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   the rest of your life as if you didn't believe that at all.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.960]   You may face every problem that comes in the typical worldly manner as everybody else faces
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   it.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.600]   Now that's the kind of thing we are told we mustn't do.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.480]   The whole of our thinking must become Christian.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.640]   Everything must be looked at from this particular angle and from this particular standpoint.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   In other words, that is, I say, the thing that differentiates the Christian from everybody
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.320]   else, and it is, as he says here, something which is an absolute essential in this fight
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   against the devil.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.840]   And I adduced evidence to show you that that is not only taught and taught very plainly
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   in the scriptures.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.080]   It's something that the Church has always realized in every period when she has truly
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.700]   functioned as the Church and has not become just a human institution.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.320]   That is why, as I indicated, you had all those great councils in the early centuries.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   That's the whole explanation of the origin of the creeds and the confessions of the Christian
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   Church.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.280]   They all came into being simply because the Church realized that if she didn't put on
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.840]   the girdle of truth and realized that this was the only way to fight, that the whole
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.800]   life of the Church would be lost and everything would be shipwrecked.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.920]   Now, there is something, then, that we've seen throughout the long history of the Christian
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.580]   Church.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.240]   The fundamental reason behind all this is that phrase that the apostle uses in 1 Corinthians
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.720]   15, "Evil communications corrupt good manners."
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.560]   If there is one text in the Bible which has been forgotten in this present century, it's
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.020]   that one.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.180]   The whole tendency of this century has been to say that you can preserve good manners
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.960]   without truth, but it's impossible.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   Evil communications corrupt good manners.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.300]   There's no greater fallacy than to think that you can hold on to the morals and the ethics
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.320]   and shed the truth.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.880]   The whole Bible testifies against that.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.760]   This is something which is, as I say, an utter impossibility.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.120]   They are indissolubly linked.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.960]   And therefore, there is no hope at all apart from a firm grasping of the truth and living
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.760]   our lives in terms of it.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.060]   Well, now then, the question that arises, therefore, at this point is this.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.580]   One may say, and say very rightly and very fairly, "You stand there and you say to us,
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.620]   'Stand therefore,' having your lines girt about with truth."
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.500]   Yes, but what does it mean?
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.580]   What have I got to do?
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.580]   What does it mean in practice?
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.940]   Somebody may say, "I admit, I confess that my life is a life of defeat.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.460]   The devil gets me down constantly.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.740]   I'm a defeated Christian."
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.900]   And you say that the antidote is that, "Having made sure that I'm strong in the Lord and
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.780]   in the power of his might, that I put on the whole armor of God, and especially that I
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.020]   start by girting my lines about with truth."
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.980]   But what is this truth?
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.500]   What are you talking about?
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.620]   What do you mean?
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.180]   Such a person, in other words, is putting, not in the spirit in which Pilate put it,
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.700]   but the same question.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700]   What is truth?
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:45.740]   It's a perfectly fair question to ask, and it's the question to which we must, of necessity,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.100]   address ourselves this morning.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.200]   But alas, unfortunately, it is the question about which surely there is the greatest confusion
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.940]   in the Christian church at this present hour.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.180]   I speak in a spirit of sadness, almost of despair.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.900]   Good to God that it were not necessary to say such things, nor indeed to say the kind
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   of things that I shall have to say this morning.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.340]   But alas, it is essential that we should do so.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.640]   We see the state of the Christian church in this country.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.460]   Would anybody like to call this country a Christian country today?
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.180]   Look at the state of the church herself.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.620]   The statistics are speaking eloquently.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.820]   She doesn't count.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.180]   Compare the church today with the church depicted in the New Testament, or the church that you
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:51.140]   can read of at certain periods and eras in her long history.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.500]   The church is in a pathetic and a powerless condition.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   And why?
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.100]   Well, there's only one answer, it seems to me.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.660]   It is because she does not accept this teaching.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:10.100]   It's because this exhortation of the great apostle is so thoroughly unpopular today,
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.180]   being argued against.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.980]   What I mean is this.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:23.660]   The modern attitude, the modern attitude in the church, I mean, is almost the exact opposite
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.660]   of this exhortation.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.460]   Here is the apostle's first principle.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.120]   "Gird your loins about with truth."
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.160]   He says if the church is to function as a body, if you were to function successfully
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.580]   as an individual Christian, the first thing you've got to do is to put this truth about
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.580]   your loins.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:47.780]   Let this bind and bend you together and set you on your feet and energize you.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.020]   But what is this truth?
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.320]   How may I know what truth is?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.140]   And it's just there, I say, that you get this pathetic, tragic confusion at this present
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.140]   time.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.140]   Now, I don't arrange these things.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.340]   I had no idea even three weeks ago what I would be preaching on this morning.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.780]   But to me, it's an extraordinary thing that we should happen to come to this point after
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.980]   this last week, which has been devoted, as you all know, to prayer for reunion and union
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.980]   in the church.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.980]   They like the term "active."
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:27.700]   We're going back to these old terms, these Roman Catholic terms.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.460]   This eight days that has been spent in prayer for reunion, and you've heard the talks
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.860]   and the addresses, you've read the articles.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.940]   Now then, the question is, what have we been told?
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.940]   What's it all about?
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.740]   Well, isn't this the truth?
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.980]   This is the essence of the modern attitude.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.580]   Look at it generally for a moment.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:55.420]   Is not the whole emphasis today put upon some general spirit rather than upon particular
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   truth?
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.660]   A general spirit of attitude and of friendship and of love and of worshipping together.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.260]   Now, of course, that's an excellent thing.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.580]   We should love one another.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.900]   There should be a unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.700]   Yes, but the whole question is, what is that?
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.260]   You can't put on a vague spirit.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.980]   But the apostle says there is something here, it's a piece of the armor that you can take
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.460]   hold of, you can take it up and you can put it on.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.980]   But you can't put on a spirit, it's impossible.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.380]   You can't put on something that is vague and indefinite and general.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.460]   Yet that is the great emphasis at the present time.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   We are told the hope for the church and the hope for the individual is this general spirit.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:50.340]   Or another way in which it's put is this, that the life is more important than the belief.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.940]   I suppose that sums it up more perfectly than anything else.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:01.180]   The whole tendency today is to say that whatever a man may say in words, whatever he may say
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:07.140]   about what he believes and what he doesn't believe, if he lives a good life, well, he's
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.140]   a Christian.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.180]   Now, we are constantly meeting these statements.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.540]   I read one only this past week again.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.100]   "Lo, they said about this man, he was a great man, of course he was a great man, and he
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   did great good.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.100]   They said, though he of course would have said that he wasn't a Christian, his life
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.860]   proves that he was a Christian."
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.300]   Now, that's said in the name of the Christian church.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.260]   So I say that it's not surprising that the average Christian says, "I'm told to gird
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.540]   my lines with truth, but what is truth?
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.940]   What am I to gird myself with?"
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.060]   Is belief of any value at all?
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.940]   Does it matter at all?
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.460]   If we are going to meet atheists in heaven, well then, is it, does it matter to the slightest
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.260]   extent what I believe?
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.260]   What is truth?
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.820]   Does truth count at all?
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.060]   Is it possible to know what it is?
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:10.140]   No, I'm not here, as I say, to imagine things.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.220]   Would to God I say once more that I hadn't to say these things.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.780]   But my dear friends, I have to stand before the judgment throne of Christ and give an
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.660]   account of the deeds done in the body.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.460]   And I cannot be silent in the midst of all this terrible confusion.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.100]   I believe that these things which are being said are not only confusing people, they are
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.900]   undoubtedly driving people to hell.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.380]   For to tell people that it doesn't matter what you believe, as long as you live a good
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:46.820]   life and do good, is to me not only a denial of the gospel, it is to encourage people not
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.220]   to believe in the only truth that can save them.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.100]   And not only that, I am concerned as a pastor.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.220]   If I accept this modern attitude, what am I to say to people who come to me asking for
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.260]   my advice and my help?
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.820]   As they do, because life is difficult and trying.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.820]   What am I to say to people?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.580]   I am to say to them, "Well, just try to think thoughts of love.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.780]   Just try to go on doing as much good as you can, and let's all be friendly together."
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.340]   That doesn't help people.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.140]   It patently doesn't help them.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.180]   And the more this kind of vague, nebulous teaching is given, the more people turn their
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.020]   backs upon the Church, and I don't blame them.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.620]   There's much more definite teaching in the cults than there is very often in the Christian
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.900]   Church herself.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.100]   And we have no right to complain that the people are turning their backs.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.300]   I know how our lines are to be girded about with truth.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.540]   Well, now, there it is in general, but let's look at it in particular.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:55.620]   What is being actively, seriously taught is this, that truth cannot be defined.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.980]   That is the essence of this modern attitude.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.100]   You see, it's the whole basis of this appeal.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.300]   They say, "Yes, the Church divided and separated."
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.300]   Why?
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.940]   Because people have been standing on particular doctrines, and that always divides.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   What do we do?
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.220]   Well, we must just agree that truth is so great and so wonderful and so glorious that
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.100]   it cannot be defined.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.700]   Truth you see is something we are told which is caught, not taught.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.340]   Now that's actually being said and taught.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.940]   Truth is caught, it's felt, not thought.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.340]   You can't put it, they say, into definitions.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.300]   You can't put it down as a series of propositions.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   It's just something that you're aware of.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:46.940]   Now let me give you one illustration of a man putting this in a book, in a book that
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:55.460]   is meant to be Christian, by a Christian leader, actually with the title "Ultimate Christian."
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.020]   He was concerned in dealing with fundamentals.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.180]   Yet this is how he puts it.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.220]   He says the whole trouble in the past has been that people have been trying to define
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.100]   what is right and what is wrong.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.980]   He says that can't be done.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.300]   What is Christianity?
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   What is this truth?
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   Well, he gives a great picture.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.380]   I think I've mentioned it before to you, of a man hearing that if he only climbs to
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.140]   the top of a mountain that he'll have a wonderful view, see a great panorama.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.380]   And he wants to see that.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.380]   He's dissatisfied.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.140]   So one day he sets out to climb to the top of the mountain, and after much effort and
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.980]   striving and sweating and cutting his knees and his hands, he gets to the summit, and
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.820]   there he looks at the great panorama.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.340]   What does he do, asks this man?
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:45.100]   Does he go home and now write all that he's seen in propositions and definitions, one,
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.100]   two, three, four?
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.900]   Of course, he says, he doesn't.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.700]   You can't describe a glorious view like that, he says, in such terms.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.020]   No, no, he says, there's only one thing to do.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.620]   He just stands there in utter amazement.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.820]   He can't, he's speechless.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.980]   He says, I can imagine him dancing, I can imagine him singing, but what he cannot imagine
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:11.380]   the man doing is writing down what he's seen, dissecting it, analyzing it, defining it,
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.900]   and contrasting it with something else.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.340]   He said, that's to ruin it.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.660]   You can't analyze a flower, you can't analyze an aroma.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.020]   You can sense it, you can feel it, you can be thrilled by it, but you can't analyze it.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.580]   The moment you bring these rough hands of yours and try to analyze, you've lost the
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.580]   thing.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.580]   That's truth.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.780]   Well, now, that's the modality.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:39.700]   And following that, of course, you get this, that to express criticism is something which
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.620]   is terribly wrong.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.980]   And if you venture to criticize or to say that some teaching is wrong, well, you're
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.140]   just dismissed as a contentious person.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.340]   It's said that your spirit isn't Christian any longer.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.740]   You've become narrow.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.260]   You say that you alone are right.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.340]   No, no, you mustn't.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.860]   Who can define truth?
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.300]   He sees it like that, I see it like this.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.220]   Doesn't matter, we're all concerned about the same thing.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.140]   You mustn't criticize that.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.940]   And you mustn't say about any teaching that it's wrong.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.900]   If the man really is doing his best and trying to uplift himself and humanity, well, what
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.140]   right have you to say that he's wrong?
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.780]   You can't define truth.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.100]   Truth eludes this.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.380]   So your critical faculties got to be thrown overboard, and you must let anybody say anything
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.900]   he likes, believe what you like, as long as you're out to do good and so on.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.580]   In other words, unity is put before doctrine.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.820]   There is only one truth, it seems to me, which is believed by the majority today, and that
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.220]   is unity.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.180]   That's their only article of belief.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:47.380]   We must all come together, at all costs, believe what you like.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:53.300]   You see, it's come to this, and it's rapidly going in this direction.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.460]   Rome and ourselves must be one.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.820]   The reformers were wrong.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.300]   The Roman Catholics are Christians, very well, we must all come together.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.340]   Who's to say that they are wrong and that we are right?
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.940]   What right have they to say that we are wrong and that they are right?
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.820]   No, no, you can't define this.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.500]   So anybody who says he's a Christian, well, he's my brother.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   We are all one.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.300]   And so they're all concerned about bringing together again.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.660]   Roman Catholicism and Protestantism into one great world church.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.260]   Now, my friends, let's be perfectly clear about this.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.060]   That is the end of that argument.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.580]   You have no right to stop short at merely the unification of the different sections
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.140]   of Protestantism.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.820]   You must follow your own argument.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.860]   If the argument is that you cannot define truth, and that if a man claims to be a Christian,
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.220]   well, then you must be one with him, whatever he says or believes.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.540]   The end of that is we must all go back to Rome.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.900]   You can't stop short of it.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.940]   You must be consistent.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.700]   And it therefore means that the Reformation was a disaster.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   And they say so.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.860]   They're saying so quite openly.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.060]   And it's the logical end of this argument that you cannot define truth, that you mustn't
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.860]   criticize, that you mustn't ask questions.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:12.100]   You must take every man at his face value and in a spirit of charity and in a spirit
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   of friendship.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.700]   You must be ready to work with him.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:22.220]   And of course, at the back of all this is this, that the ultimate standard and test
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.360]   of everything is modern knowledge.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.380]   This is being taught quite plainly.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:35.340]   I read in a religious journal only this past week that specific statement that the Bible
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.940]   was of great value, but of course it would be foolish to expect it to help us at the
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.020]   present time.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.860]   It was written in days when society was primitive and simple.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.220]   And the problems of those times, of course, were dealt with and dealt with very adequately.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.060]   Not only that, the article went on to say, it's got insights.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.520]   That's the word, insights, which are of great help to us today.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.300]   But obviously in the complexity of modern civilization and modern society, it would
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.340]   be foolish and ridiculous to expect the Bible to be adequate.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.020]   No, no, we've gone beyond.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.260]   So we rest upon our modern knowledge, our modern understanding, and our modern learning.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:26.860]   Very well then, there's the teaching that has been poured out during this past week.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:34.300]   I ask the question in the light of it all, how am I to put on the girdle of truth?
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.900]   The apostle tells me that it's absolutely essential.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.040]   It's the first thing I've got to do.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.620]   If I don't do this, I can't put on the whole armor of God.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.580]   Without the whole armor of God, I'm already defeated.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.940]   I must know what it is.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.240]   The apostle says it's something that I can take up and I can put it on.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.380]   But I'm being told, you cannot define it.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.500]   Now, there's only one answer to all this, my dear friends.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.660]   Let me say it once more.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:12.360]   In this book, truth is defined, error is condemned.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.340]   I gave you an illustration this morning in that second chapter of the second epistle
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.340]   to Timothy.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.340]   What's happening there?
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.860]   Well, doesn't the apostle, right through the whole chapter, virtually say the one and
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:28.380]   the same thing, that we must hold on to the truth?
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.540]   There were some who were denying it, saying that the resurrection was past already.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.940]   The apostle Paul calls that sort of teaching a canker.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:44.560]   But if I called it a canker today, I'd be vilified as a kind of arrogant person, a contentious
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   person.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.180]   Fancy saying that if a man says the resurrection is past already, that he's teaching a cancerous
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.180]   teaching.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.900]   You mustn't do that, you've got spirits wrong.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.740]   The apostle Paul says that.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.740]   He defines doctrine.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.740]   Did you notice his phrase?
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:06.100]   Remember, he says that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.420]   to my gospel.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   My gospel.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.420]   Oh, sheer arrogance.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.900]   He'd be dismissed as a contentious, arrogant fellow.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.380]   And they're saying that about him, of course.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.140]   There are many who don't hesitate to say that.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.020]   They don't like the apostle Paul.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.660]   They like what they call the simple gospel of Jesus.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.100]   This gospel of love.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.980]   But Paul came along with his legalistic mind and feisted.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.660]   That's the kind of thing that's being said, my friends.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.380]   And it's not surprising the Christian church is as she is.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.180]   He talks about my gospel, but did you notice another thing he said?
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.500]   He says, "Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.740]   the things that thou hast heard of me."
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.660]   The things that thou hast heard of me.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.500]   The particular things.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.700]   The specific portions of the teaching.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.340]   Because the apostle Paul, obviously from the Acts and the Epistles, didn't just always
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.860]   get up and say, "It's all right.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.260]   Let's all be friends together.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.460]   The love of God will cover anything.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.060]   Believe anything you like, as long as we're all nice and kind and friendly, and we're
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.300]   all one, and making a common front."
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:18.220]   "The things which thou hast heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:24.380]   to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also."
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.380]   What are these things?
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.380]   Well, they're particulars.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.260]   They're always particulars.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.660]   And he takes up one particular thing, the resurrection.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.940]   Now today we are told it doesn't matter whether a man believes in the literal, physical resurrection
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   or not.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.940]   Doesn't matter at all.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.500]   Doesn't matter whether he believes in the resurrection of the body at the end.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   Doesn't matter.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   What's it matter?
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   As long as he's a good man.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.540]   As long as he's doing good.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.060]   Let him deny the resurrection and anything else.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:55.620]   "Thou knowest," says the apostle, "the foundation of God standeth sure."
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.780]   And then you notice what he says at the end.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.820]   He says, "The servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men, apt to
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.020]   teach, patient in meekness, instructing those that oppose themselves."
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.860]   You've got to instruct them.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.700]   And you can't instruct them unless you can say that they're wrong and you are right.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.060]   Why do you instruct them?
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:21.100]   If God, peradventure, will give them repentance through the acknowledging of the truth, these
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.420]   men have gone wrong at particular points in their doctrine.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.420]   What are we to do about them?
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.860]   Well, we are to be very patient with them.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.180]   And we are to see that they're in error and we must instruct them.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:37.260]   We must put the truth to them in order that they may come back to the truth and that they
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:44.220]   may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who were taken captive by him at
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.220]   his will.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.220]   It means this.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.420]   He says, "These men, let's feel sorry for them," he says.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.420]   What's happened to them?
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.340]   Oh, well, they've fallen into the snare of the devil.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.660]   The devil, like a trapper of animals, is setting his snares everywhere to catch ignorant people,
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.500]   people who don't believe in teaching and who say it doesn't matter what you believe
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.900]   as long as you're living a good life and are a good and a nice fellow, and so on.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.220]   You mustn't define your doctrine.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.660]   The devil has set the snares for them, and they drop into the snare, and the snare suddenly
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.100]   cramps down upon them, and they can't get free.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.940]   Now he says, "You and I are to set them free."
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.220]   And that is why I'm calling your attention to this thing this morning.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:32.820]   My dear friend, if this is true, you will never know true peace, you will never know
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.740]   the joy of the Lord, you will never know true Christian living until you believe the Christian
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.740]   doctrine.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.980]   It is impossible.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.940]   You can persuade yourself that all is well, yes, but the devil is able to put upon people
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.780]   what are called strong delusions.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.860]   Like a poor man who's mad may feel that everything's perfect in the world, or a man under the influence
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.420]   of alcohol says everything's all right.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.460]   So the devil can make people think that all is right with his delusions.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.460]   Believe not every spirit, says the New Testament, but test the spirits, whether they are of
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.460]   God.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:16.260]   Now, you see, the New Testament is perfectly clear about all these things.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.580]   The truth can be defined, it can be stated in propositions, that's what we've got in
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.120]   these epistles.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.800]   You must therefore say that other teaching is wrong, you must condemn it.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.880]   The New Testament argues, the New Testament is polemical.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.160]   The Apostle Paul uses very strong language.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:42.360]   He says that people are believing a lie, that they're false teachers, and he warns people
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.960]   to flee from them, as from the very plague itself.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.320]   He says, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.080]   which we have preached.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.640]   Let him be accursed."
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.840]   Now, he wasn't saying that to people outside in the world, he was saying that about false
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.240]   teachers in the church.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.400]   And yet, you see, today, if you say things like that, if you even repeat them, you're
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.600]   contentious, you're narrow, you're negative, you think that you alone are right, you're
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   opinionated.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.960]   Is it surprising that the Christian church is as she is at the present time?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:25.480]   And as I was indicating to you last Sunday, all this modern teaching is not only a denial
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.000]   of the New Testament, it is a denial of what the church itself has taught throughout the
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.480]   centuries.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.320]   If you can't define truth, if you can't state it in propositions, well then, scrap
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.040]   your Apostle's Creed.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.400]   Stop repeating it.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   Drop your Athanasian Creed.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.320]   Throw your Nicene Creed into the waste paper basket.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.920]   Burn up all the great confessions of the faith.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.640]   They were wrong in principle.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   Leave alone in details.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.800]   It's a denial.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.880]   It's a going back upon what the people of God have done under the guidance and the power
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.720]   and the leading of the Holy Spirit in all the greatest and the most wonderful periods
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   in the history of the Christian church.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.440]   But my dear friends, I'm not concerned about it so much in that general aspect as in the
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.600]   personal.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.800]   How am I to put on the girdle of truth?
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   What is it?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.400]   Don't you want to ask that question?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.440]   Don't you come to church in order to ask that question?
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.000]   How can I put on this girdle of truth?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.080]   What is truth?
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.440]   Can anybody tell me?
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.760]   Is it possible to answer the question?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:40.440]   Is there any sense in the Apostle's exaltation?
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.200]   And the answer, of course, is perfectly clear.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   How am I to know what is truth?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   What is my authority?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   That's the question.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.240]   The great question of today is the question of authority.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.760]   What am I to believe?
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.080]   What am I to say amidst these Babel voices?
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:05.000]   Well, the first answer is that my authority must not be reason.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.200]   That's the authority today, human reason.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.800]   Based upon modern knowledge.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:19.480]   We are told that because we are living in a scientific age that it's different.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.360]   But you see, that's no authority for this reason.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.640]   That are clearly and patently it's quite inadequate.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.440]   I can't trust my own reason as my ultimate authority.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   Why?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.840]   Well, for this very good cause that I know that there is so much I don't know, there's
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.480]   so much I don't understand.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.520]   My mind is too finite, it's too small.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.000]   And then when I'm told that it's dependent upon modern knowledge and that I mustn't
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.840]   accept knowledge from the past, well, then that leaves me in this position.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.360]   If I say today in the light of my knowledge that everything in the past was wrong, I know
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.280]   perfectly well that people in fifty and a hundred years time will be saying exactly
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.360]   the same about what I know now.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.700]   So what I know now must be wrong.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:08.700]   What can I do therefore?
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   Well, I can do nothing.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.700]   I've got nothing.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.840]   It's a shifting sand, it's a sort of sliding scale.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   But apart from all that, what is my reason or the reason of any man when put up against
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.520]   the reason and the knowledge and the cleverness and the subtlety of the devil?
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.160]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.320]   We are not merely arguing with men.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.360]   We are arguing with the subtlest mind in the whole universe apart from the mind of the
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.520]   triune God.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.320]   It's his whole emphasis.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.560]   The wilds, the subtlety of the devil, and of course the whole history given us in the
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.200]   Bible is just an illustration of this subtlety of the devil.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.440]   How the best, the greatest, the most saintly minds were trapped by the devil.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.400]   Some of the best men have gone astray.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.840]   If I am to rely upon human reason, I'm already defeated.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.000]   I'm not fighting men.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.160]   I'm fighting this angelic power, this fallen angelic power, the devil, Satan.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.280]   You can't rely upon your reason.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.640]   It's too small.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   It's too inadequate.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.920]   Yet that's what they're doing.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.720]   They're bringing their reason and they're criticizing the Bible.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.760]   They're criticizing the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.480]   He was a child of his age, they say.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.520]   He couldn't possibly know what we know.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.440]   That's human reason, human knowledge set in the supreme position.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.320]   And you're left without any authority at all.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.160]   Can't be reason.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.480]   Well what about my feelings?
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.360]   And this is the favorite in many ways today, because the more honest minds have got to
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:48.440]   admit that reason always brings you to a blank wall.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:55.000]   The two world wars have shattered the faith of the first part of the century in human
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.600]   reason.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.840]   Humanism is more or less defeated and ridiculed by the wars.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.600]   And people are therefore leaving it today and are making this leap into the realm of
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   feeling.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.200]   Ah, they say, don't try to understand too much, don't try to reason.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.240]   It's what you feel, it's what you experience that matters.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.200]   This indefinable something that gets you, that's the thing, feeling.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.480]   But that's no authority.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   Why?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.840]   Well, because as we all know perfectly well, our feelings are so variable.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.240]   They're so changeable.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.360]   They're so unreliable.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.720]   They come and they go.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.080]   You never know what you're going to be like.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.400]   I dare not trust my sweetest frame.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   Why?
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   Well, because it may have gone by tomorrow.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.880]   If I'm going to listen to my feelings, well then I'm constantly in a different position.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.120]   Sometimes happy, sometimes miserable, sometimes feeling all is well, sometimes not, sometimes
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.640]   thrilled by reading the Bible, at other times having to force myself to get something out
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.680]   of it, dry, arid, dull, stupid.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   Isn't that your experience?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.840]   Well, how can you rely on feeling as your authority?
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.800]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.240]   And when you add to that that it can be so easily counterfeited.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:19.560]   If what is nice is of necessity good, if what gives me a nice comfortable feeling must be
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.960]   right, well then I've no answer whatsoever to the cults.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   I've no reply.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.840]   I would just have to say, "Well, go to them.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   Anything that makes you feel better, anything that gives you a kind of release and relief,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   go after it.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   It's all right.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.840]   Anything that helps you, anything that makes you a better man, it must be right.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   Go after it."
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.000]   And I'd have to stand here sending people to the cults.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.180]   If we rely upon feelings, if we rely merely upon the pragmatic test of that which makes
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.000]   me feel better, that which makes me better, that which makes me live a better life, I've
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.880]   no standard at all.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.840]   I can't criticize any teaching.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.440]   It's so entirely subjective that I have no standard whatsoever.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.560]   No, no.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.160]   And lastly, let me say this.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.300]   The authority is not the church either.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:10.080]   Not reason, not feeling, not the church.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.040]   Here is a teaching that's coming back more and more.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.920]   There stands over, of course, the Roman Catholic Church, claiming that it is her authority
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   that is final.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.480]   "Oh yes," she says, "the Bible's all right, but not enough."
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   We've added to it.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   We've had further revelation.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.680]   You've got to believe the church as well as the Bible.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.360]   Here is something that is obviously coming back.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.560]   There is this drift so rapidly back in the direction of Rome.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.980]   It's inevitable.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.040]   If we have no tests, well, there's only one conclusion.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.600]   Go back to Rome.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.240]   But why do I say that we can't accept that as our authority?
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   Well there are endless reasons for that.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.720]   Let me give you just some vital ones.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.160]   This and this alone is enough.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.520]   The way that she has so obviously departed from the early church is sufficient in and
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.560]   of itself.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.920]   I once asked a Roman Catholic priest who was kind enough to come to speak to me this one
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.320]   question.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.960]   I said, "Can you see your church as she is today in the New Testament?"
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.880]   He said, "I'd never thought of that."
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.480]   I said, "Think of it now."
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   And he did think.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   I said, "What?"
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.520]   He said, "I've got to admit I cannot see it."
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.280]   Of course he couldn't.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280]   It's an accretion.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.480]   They borrowed from pagan religions.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.040]   They borrowed from utter paganism.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.200]   They've added these accretions.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.360]   You can't see that church in the New Testament.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.640]   It's totally unlike it.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.520]   And that, I say, is sufficient in and of itself.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.400]   But say somebody wants all this got to do with me.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.800]   I came to get a little personal help this morning.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.120]   My dear friend, it's got this to do with you.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   That if you really are in trouble, you'll become desperate.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.480]   And one day you'll be confronted.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.680]   You may meet in a bus or working next to you in your office a Roman Catholic who says,
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   "Look here.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   You can't deal with these things.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.280]   You've been fool enough to think you can all the years.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.600]   There's only one thing for you to do.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.320]   Come back to Mother Church.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.440]   She'll take it from you.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.160]   The priest will take it from you.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.000]   You don't have to carry your burden.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.200]   Come and hand it over.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   Hand yourself over."
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.360]   That's what takes people to Rome.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.400]   As very intellectual people, like the late Mr. G.K.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.800]   Chesterton and hundreds of others, intellectual people in the States at the present time,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.240]   are crowding back to Rome.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.680]   Why, they're bewildered.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.480]   But I say this is no authority.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   Why?
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:33.000]   Well, because of these additions of men for which there is no authority at all.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.320]   And not only that, their additions contradict their own teaching.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.640]   The Church of Rome has not abandoned belief in the deity of Christ, in the facts concerning
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.400]   him in his atoning death, in his literal resurrection.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.120]   She's held on to those, but she's added other things which deny that original teaching.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.360]   And here she is a mess of contradictions.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.640]   Let me give you but one illustration of what I'm trying to say.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:07.040]   Take this growing cult of Maryolatry, worship of the Virgin Mary, in the Roman Catholic
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   Church.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:13.920]   I'm only reading this, my dear friends, to awaken you, not to believe what you've
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.480]   been hearing for the last eight days about "let's all be one," even Rome.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   They're Christians.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.880]   Let's pray with them.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.480]   Let's be one with them.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   This is a good reason for it.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:28.040]   Here's an article by a Monsignor, a high official in the Roman Church.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.000]   I'm quoting him.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.720]   Each time we repeat the prayer, "Save us, O Queen," we spontaneously admit the queenship
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   of Mary.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:46.280]   Mary is Queen of heaven and earth because she is the mother of Jesus, the King of the
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:54.400]   universe, thus becoming the co-redemptrix of the human race.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.840]   The co-redemptrix, the co-redemptor, if you like, of the human race.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.240]   Mary is Queen because she is the mother of Christ, the King.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.840]   It is because Mary gave life to a Son who is King and Lord of everything that she is
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.600]   somehow mysteriously the mother of the Trinity.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.360]   The mother of the Trinity, the Father and the Holy Ghost as well as the Son, and also
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.120]   of Christ who is King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.720]   Mary is still our Queen and co-redemptrix of our salvation.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.360]   It was she, one who was free from guilt and sin.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.800]   Where do they find that in the Scriptures?
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   Nowhere.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.120]   None of this is to be found in the Scriptures.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:46.240]   It was she who was free from all guilt and sin that offered her Son on Calvary's cross,
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.760]   sacrificing her maternal love and rights for our eternal salvation.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.080]   She's done it.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.520]   She sacrificed her own maternal love and rights for our salvation.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.760]   Mary, Queen of goodness and mercy, full of love and grace, guides all humanity towards
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.720]   paradise.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.120]   Sitting beside Christ, she's sitting beside Christ, you see, who is the ruler of the world,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:17.920]   is Mary, whom our Redeemer has entrusted as the official dispenser of grace.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.800]   Mary is the official dispenser of grace.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.480]   The authority that Mary has is based on the power of intercession and mediatorship because
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.080]   she has access to the heart of Christ the King.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:36.320]   She has the key to this heart and distributes all the grace and treasures that are enclosed
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   therein.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   Very well.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.960]   There it is.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:48.120]   I say I cannot regard that church as the final authority because her teaching denies the
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.400]   plain teaching of the Scripture, denies what was taught by the early church and the church
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.360]   for a number of centuries afterwards.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.440]   It is a contradiction of her own teaching at other points.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.920]   I cannot accept it.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:09.160]   Neither can I accept it because it leads to the whole system which characterizes that
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:15.440]   church, which asks me to believe in relics, miraculous relics of saints, to believe in
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.680]   miracles which are not miracles and not authenticated, and all that I know to be true of the history
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:27.080]   of that church throughout the running centuries.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:35.200]   My dear friends, I have not come here to denounce the Roman Catholic Church this morning.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.720]   I am saying these things because I believe I have been called by God to preach this gospel,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:47.000]   this truth, to warn men and women, to bring them to a knowledge of salvation through the
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.640]   truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:57.040]   I say again, I speak because I know that I will have to give an answer for my stewardship
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.760]   while I have preached in this church.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.740]   That is why I am warning you against these things.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:09.200]   You have been told that we cannot be happy until we are one again with that church that
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.760]   teaches things such as I have quoted to you.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:22.480]   And it is to me nothing but to entice and to incite people to walk deliberately into
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:32.720]   error, to believe as truth that which is a lie and which derogates from the unique glory
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.840]   of the Son of God, our only Savior and Redeemer.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:47.160]   "Yes," says the apostle, "there is one God and one and only one mediator, no co-mediator,
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:56.920]   no co-redemptrix, one and one only, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:04.880]   And to add anything to him is to take from him, and that is the final blasphemy."
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:12.240]   I say these things in the name of truth, for the sake of the honor of my blessed Lord who
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.040]   died for me.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:25.400]   I say them because I feel a responsibility not only for my own soul but for your souls.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.160]   You have got to gird yourselves and your loins about with truth, my friend.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.240]   If you don't, you are defeated.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.560]   And I am here to tell you that the truth can be known, that there is an authority.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:44.480]   It is not reason, it is not feelings, it is not the church, any church.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.520]   What is it?
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.160]   It is this book.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:56.320]   God willing, we shall proceed now, having established our authority, to try to tell
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:08.360]   you next Sunday, in detail, something of what it means to gird about your loins with truth.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:22.560]   May God have mercy upon us and upon the church in these confused, unhappy days.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.060]   Amen.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:30.000]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
