[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.180]   This episode was hosted by the Pre and Early Retirement Life Stage Chapter and recorded
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.380]   May 18th, 2022.
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.500]   The presentation and discussion topic was "Setting Your Children Up for Financial Success."
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.460]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.860]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.260]   investment advice.
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:45.460]   Okay, I think we're ready, so I'm going to end the poll and I'm going to share results.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.340]   So we have a pretty good distribution.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.660]   We don't have very many 19 to 22-year-olds, but other than that, we have between two and
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.900]   five of each of the age groups, so we have a really good representation of all different
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.180]   ages of children or no children, so that's great.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.940]   Okay, can y'all see those results?
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.460]   Okay, let's go ahead and go on.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.620]   Okay, so the first slide is, of course, we're going to just go in chronological order.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.620]   There we go.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.340]   Okay, so the topic of allowances, you've probably all been to the store where at the checkout
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.420]   you hear a poor parent kind of, you know, with a child that's either whining or crying.
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.300]   They want the parent to buy something, oh, and the poor parent says, no, I'm sorry, we
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.860]   can't buy that today.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.980]   So what's a good way to eliminate that problem, because right now you're putting the choice
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.540]   on the parent, but if you give the child an allowance, then in this kind of scenario,
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.780]   the parent can say, sure, you can buy that.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.540]   If you have enough money saved up, go right ahead, you know, so it's putting the choice
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.460]   on the child to save up, they really want this item, so that kind of eliminates a lot
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.060]   of hopefully stress when you go to the store, but before you do that, you have to explain
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.700]   to the child, you know, in most cases, the parent's going to pay for the need, which
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.540]   includes, you know, basic clothing, of course, foods, you know, school supplies, that kind
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.540]   of thing.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540]   What they want, of course, would be toys, you know, as they get older, in the old days,
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.100]   it would have been a record, now it's, I guess, Apple Music, however they get the songs nowadays,
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.180]   or even like fancier clothes, like a name brand, an expensive sneaker, whereas you might
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.580]   say, okay, I'll pay, I'll pay $40 for your basic, you know, decent sneaker, but if you
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.220]   want to pay 75, you're going to have to pay the difference.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.300]   So basically, it's a good thing to just lay out ahead of time, these are, these are your
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.420]   needs versus wants, we're going to cover your needs, you're going to save up for your wants
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.640]   with your allowance, your birthday money, or extra money that you earn.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.580]   So there's kind of a debate whether or not to tie allowance to chores.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.340]   And a lot of parents say, you know, do you want to tie it to the chores?
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.340]   Some don't.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.180]   And I did read several books and listen to some podcasts to prepare for this.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.280]   And what most people, the kind of experts are saying, you know, a good method is a hybrid
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.860]   method where the allowance is not tied to basic chores, you have to do your basic chores,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.300]   keep your room clean, whatever else is assigned, take the garbage out, and so those are expected
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.980]   to be done, you know, that's not tied to the allowance, so you're going to get your allowance
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.980]   either way.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.740]   But the allowance is kind of a basic amount where you know, we get a few things, but it's
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.680]   not overly generous.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.740]   And then you can allow your child to earn extra money by doing kind of extra seasonal
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.980]   chores above and beyond the normal chores, raking leaves, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.140]   So that's what a lot of people recommend is like a hybrid method.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.780]   But basically, you know, you can choose however you want to do it.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.860]   And then there's the debate over whether you should pay the allowance in cash, or some
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.180]   kind of electronic ledger.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.500]   I remember when my children were little, we started out with cash, but then we had a problem
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.340]   where if I would go to the store and buy him a toy, then they reimburse me for me, we got
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.340]   we got home.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.780]   But then later on, we were like, we can't remember if they got reimbursed.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.900]   And my child was like, Oh, I know I had $30.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   Where did it go?
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.460]   And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.460]   So it.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.260]   So then we switched to more of it at the time was just a paper ledger where we keep a running
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.260]   balance.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.020]   And then every time they bought something, I would subtract or every week when they got
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.780]   allowance, I would add so they could go back and see if they couldn't remember, you know,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.780]   because sometimes you can't remember what all you spent on.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.380]   But nowadays, of course, you can do a spreadsheet, but that might be kind of cumbersome to open
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.500]   the spreadsheet every time you do a vote.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.100]   So there's kind of pros and cons of each method.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.700]   One thing you want to do is encourage your child to plan purchases ahead of time, you
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.500]   know, don't buy an impulse and encourage them to eventually, the goal is to learn to save
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.660]   up for something bigger to delay gratification and save up.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.180]   And some parents help by doing like a little thermometer chart where they show the progress
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.740]   towards the goal if they want to, you know, buy something that's $100 that's going to
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.220]   take them a while to save up.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.420]   Very rare use of what I will call a bribe, I guess you could call it a reward.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.540]   The only things I did for my kids was every year we'd have their portrait taken.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.300]   And you can't really force a child, you know, you have to smile or else, like, what are
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   you going to do?
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.500]   You can't make them smile for the picture.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.060]   So what I would do is once a year when they had their portraits taken, you know, we're
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.420]   going to go get your portraits taken.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.460]   And then I'm going to, you know, you can buy a toy up to $10 or whatever, whatever it is.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.980]   And then the only other thing I kind of, I guess you could call it a bribe or a reward.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.780]   The only other thing I kind of bribed them with was when they were out of their crib
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.540]   to their, you know, the big, big bed.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.700]   That's a very scary thing for them.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   And so they really needed like an incentive.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.020]   If you, the first night you stayed in your big bed all night, you know, you can pick
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.940]   out a toy.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.700]   And then there's the issue of holiday birthday gifts.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.340]   What we did was we kind of set a dollar amount and, you know, every once in a while, some
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.060]   years we were just, I'm feeling really generous this year, I'm going to buy them a PlayStation
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.060]   or whatever.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.060]   But usually they knew they were only getting a certain amount and we didn't go overboard
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.100]   with the gifts, but you know, that's up to you.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.380]   There are some board games to make it fun for the child, you know, young children love
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.380]   to play board.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.180]   I know my kids love to play board games.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.660]   So some of the ones I've heard of, we, we personally had life and monopoly, but I've
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.460]   also heard of payday and there's one called the allowance game.
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.860]   Now this is something I do not have personal experience with, but there's something I've
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.940]   heard mentioned several times called fam zoo, family finance app.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.040]   And I did kind of look into a little bit.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.980]   It does have a fee.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.380]   I think it was maybe if you paid for a whole year, it was like 30 or $40 for the whole
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.980]   year or $6 a month, which isn't super cheap, but it might be worth it.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.100]   And you can order debit cards for each child.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.780]   You can even, even order them for a young child, but if the younger than 13, it had
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.780]   to have the parent's name.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.700]   And the parent is supposed to be with the child that they make an online purchase.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.380]   And then it also has all these you know, you could look up, what did you spend on what's
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.460]   the balance for each child and easily transfer from the parents account to the child's account
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.220]   and that kind of thing.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:45.140]   So does anybody have any tips or what worked for them as far as allowances for their young,
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.660]   young children or anything like that?
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.540]   We'd love to hear from you guys.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:57.220]   Just use your, if you do just use your raised hand icon and zoom to raise your hand.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.740]   Keith.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.220]   Yes.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.820]   You know, a couple of things from here that, that we did that I'll, I'll share.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.140]   The first thing is the holiday and birthday gifts.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:18.780]   We lack of better term mandated that half of what they got from grandmas and grandpas
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:26.000]   and aunts and uncles and everybody for birthdays and holidays went into a savings account.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.660]   And then the other half, they, they got to keep that money.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:38.740]   And then when they were around 12 or so years old we bought a, like a little plastic container,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.700]   you know, big enough that you could put papers and a checkbook and things in and they would
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.700]   put the money in there.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.660]   And I had them make a basically a checkbook leg ledger with a piece of paper.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.980]   And if they wanted to go buy something, they had to pay me and then they would mark it
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:02.860]   off of their balance that was in this container that had their money and other papers and
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.080]   things that they had.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.560]   So the objective was to, to a kind of teach them how a checkbook works, but without actually
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.060]   having a checking account because they were just around 12 years old or so.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.060]   And also the lesson that you should always save when you get something and not just spend
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.620]   it all on something.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.060]   And I think over time that message kind of came through.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.360]   And the other thing we did with, with the gifts is if there's something they wanted
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   to buy with the money that they had left, I would have them pay me and then I would
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.880]   buy it.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.360]   And I actually put that into my own little container.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.240]   And then when they were getting ready to go to college, I handed them all that money back
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.960]   that I had been sitting on that they had paid over the years.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   And I don't know, it amounted to somewhere between I think $800 and $1,000 for, for each
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.720]   of my three kids.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.120]   So number one, they were very surprised that they got that money back because they never
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.240]   knew that that was going on, but to them, they were spending their money.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.800]   They had to account for it, but since they were 12 or 13 years old, I didn't expect them
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   to pay for it.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.120]   I just sat on the money and then handed it back to them.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.320]   So the lesson was you need to, you know, be responsible with your money and need to keep
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   track of it.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.400]   You need to make sure that you put it in a safe place that you can find it.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.320]   Otherwise you just find money all over the place, all over their rooms.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:42.240]   And it hopefully taught them to be kind of responsible and organized with their money.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.480]   Seems like, it seems like it worked.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.680]   All three of my kids are in their twenties now, and it, it seemed like it taught them,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.800]   you know, for the most part, that lesson.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Great.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.680]   Thank you so much, Keith, for sharing your experiences.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   Yes, we, we did a similar thing with the bank accounts.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Our kids opened their first bank accounts at Chase Bank at maybe they were five or six
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.720]   years old and the bank had a cute account for the kids and it was a savings account
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.160]   and they would walk in, you know, they would be like really small and they'd walk in and
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.480]   they'd stand in line with everybody and put their deposit, their birthday money there.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   And it was nice.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.840]   And they had their little passbook.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.200]   Not that they really made a lot of money, but it was the, the idea of getting them used
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.320]   to banks, getting used to going into banks, and that this is what we do.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.960]   This is what our family does.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.800]   We use banks and we save money in banks and we deposit our money in banks.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:52.640]   And then when they got a little older, actually when they, they, all my kids were at Vanguard,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.880]   I believe at 16 years of age, as soon as they could have their own accounts, and these were
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.000]   taxable accounts, they opened them there.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.760]   They were joint accounts with me.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:10.480]   And as soon as they started working, they had a Roth IRA and they would deposit, I would
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.840]   show them how to deposit the money into the Roth IRA.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   At the end of the year, they would find out how much, when they got their W-2, they had
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.600]   earned that year and then deposit that in the IRA.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.400]   Actually my husband and I decided early on that what we would do to help our children
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.680]   is to do the depositing.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.840]   We would put the money in the IRA for them, especially if they put the rest of that money
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.760]   into their taxable account.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.520]   And we have done that to this, to this very day.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:54.040]   Actually we, we, we finance, fund the IRAs for each of our, all of our children.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.760]   I don't know how long that will go on, but for right now we do that.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.960]   In terms of the working, when they were young, I had a family work day and this was maybe
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.920]   once or twice a year, three times a year, where I decided it was time that everybody
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.280]   in the family pulled together.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.340]   We are part of a family and this is what we do.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.040]   We take care of the house.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.540]   We do things around the house.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.440]   We do things around the yard.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.520]   You know, we clean the hamster cages, we, you know, the bunny cages, we, we, we pitch
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.080]   in and help for the family.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.520]   And so I would set the family work day, it would be posted on the kitchen counters.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.560]   They were to be here at nine o'clock in the morning.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.840]   This is before they had moved out of the house and there was no pay.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.900]   This is part of being a family, this is what we do.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.200]   And then at the end of the work day, we all went out to a restaurant for a very special
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.700]   dinner and they could have all the dessert they wanted.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.460]   So it was a nice family time, even though they grumbled and moaned and groaned and the
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.500]   neighbors would think they were really cute working out there with their wheelbarrows
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.940]   and everything.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.620]   But it, they still talk about it to this day.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.220]   Oh, that was the worst thing you did, mom, was the family work days, but they remember
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.100]   it and they really liked it.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.420]   Also on the, what Keith mentioned about saving the money, I have read, no, we did not do
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.420]   it so much.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.580]   We did not, was the three buckets or the three jars.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   You may have read about it.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.620]   One of the editors, maybe in the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times wrote about
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.980]   this many times, where when his children got money, received money, there were three ways,
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.000]   three places to put it.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   One was for charity.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.780]   They, if you had a birthday money, a little bit, some of it would go to charity in the
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.580]   charity bucket.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.580]   The second would be for savings.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.420]   That's what you put in the bank.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.740]   And the third bucket was you could use for whatever you wanted.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.620]   I can guarantee you my older son saved every bit of that money.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.700]   He saved all his money growing up.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.580]   My daughter, my daughter was a spend, liked to shop.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.620]   My younger son would save all his money except for computers.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.540]   And then he would like to spend it.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.020]   So each child was different.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.540]   We raised them all the same.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.940]   And yet each child was by nature different.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.180]   And to this very day, it's the same, they are different.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.500]   Very good.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   Thank you, Miriam.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:36.940]   Beverly and Tim, you can go ahead and start.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.780]   Hi, I'm here.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.180]   I just wanted to mention, we do something similar to Miriam in that my kids are in their
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.140]   mid to late 20s now.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.940]   And we started maybe five years ago doing an IRA match at Christmas.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.260]   So Santa would match whatever they put into their IRA account.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.340]   And they're very fond of that.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:02.300]   But thinking back to our kids having bank accounts when they were younger, we banked
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.860]   at a local bank in Princeton area.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.660]   And the kids would always go in there and make their deposits.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.940]   And one day, the manager, who knew us pretty well since it was local, asked how the kids
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.940]   were doing.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.700]   And I casually mentioned that my daughter was looking for a summer job before college.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.380]   And I wasn't even fishing, but she said, oh, well, we need a teller.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.900]   So here's an application, have her fill that out.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:29.260]   So it wound up being a great thing, because every summer, she filled in for other tellers
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   that were vacationing.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.580]   And she got a work history out of it.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:40.660]   It was a minimum wage job, but it was an added bonus of being known at the local institution.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.140]   It also became her college job.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.980]   Well, it became her college summer job also.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.100]   So she got years worth of that.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.780]   Very good.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.780]   Thank you.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.580]   There's a question in the chat, what age should allowance start?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.220]   I'll give you my opinion on these two questions, then somebody else can chime in if they want.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.660]   And then the other question was, do you give a reward for good grades?
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.260]   So as far as the age, personally, I think as soon as the child understands the concept
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.380]   of money, how much different things cost different amounts, and then they have a desire to buy
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.140]   certain toys, they're ready to have an allowance.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.700]   And personally, I think this is around the age, could be as young as four, maybe five.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.660]   That's kind of when my kids were ready.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.540]   And as far as paying for grades, it's really highly dependent on the child.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.460]   Some children would really respond well to that.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.580]   But some other children are just completely internally motivated, and they don't need
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.580]   that at all.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.420]   So it's really highly dependent on the child.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.820]   Does anybody have any input on those two questions, the age to start the allowance and whether
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.140]   or not you should pay for grades?
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.060]   Oh, Beverly and Tim, go ahead.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.260]   Do you still have your hand up?
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.980]   Does anybody have any?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.780]   I forgot to take it down.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.780]   I'll do it.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.780]   Okay.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.780]   I think.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780]   Okay.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.340]   And then somebody had had a question from the RSVP forums, how to teach kids about money
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.340]   by age.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:12.140]   And at the end of this presentation, there is a list of books that are pertinent to this
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.580]   discussion.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.180]   And some of them, there's one called Beyond, and you don't have to write these down because
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.660]   you'll see them at the end, Beyond Piggy Banks and Lemonade Stands by Liz Frazier.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.940]   And this was geared towards younger children, pre-K through fifth grade.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:33.020]   It's very, you know, so it has a lot of information on this slide, like allowances for young children.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.060]   And then there's two that cover more of an age range.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.740]   One's called Raising Your Money Savvy Family for Next Generation Financial Independence
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.220]   by Carol Pitner and Doug Nordum.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.540]   And this has a chapter, chapters, one for toddlers, one for grade school, one for tweens,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.540]   one for teens and adults.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.500]   So it kind of covers the whole gamut of ages.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.380]   And the same thing, there's another book called Kids and Money by Jane A. Pearl.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.380]   It covers toddlers through young adults.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.820]   And this was, the last book I want to mention is called Launching Financial Grownups by
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:12.740]   Bobby Rebell or Rebel, and this is geared more towards college age and young adult children.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.460]   So there's several books that kind of covers the whole range of how you, you know, different
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.700]   topics for different age of children.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.140]   The second, we had another question from the RCP for this slide, and it's the best simple
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:30.580]   way to deal with nominal amounts of birthday money, but then they say under $2,500 for
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.580]   age eight.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:38.060]   And Keith, you kind of answered that as far as the buckets, but for an amount like $2,500,
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.340]   you know, you might even want to consider putting part of it in a $529.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.140]   If there's already one open for the child, they can contribute to their own $529.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.660]   But definitely you'd want to kind of split that up, you know, charity, savings, $529
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.300]   and spending for that kind of thing.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.140]   Okay, we're going to move on to the next slide.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.460]   Let's see here.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.020]   Oh, I skipped one.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.340]   Okay, the next slide is teens.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.140]   The only topics I want to bring up for this is you may want to consider for a teen giving
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:16.340]   your child either a quarterly or an annual lump sum for some categories, such as clothing,
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:21.860]   just say, I'm going to give you X amount for clothing for the whole year, and you can spend
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.980]   it however you want.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:28.260]   And then hopefully, that will teach them how to manage a lump sum over a longer period
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.260]   of time.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.580]   And they'll realize, oh, if I buy everything I want right away, all the expensive brands,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.420]   you know, when I grow two inches at the end of the year, I'm not going to have enough
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.180]   to buy some more jeans, you know, they're going to kind of learn that they need to kind
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:47.420]   of plan ahead and anticipate their needs for the whole year.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.280]   And then some of the books I read, there was a lot of talk about helicopter parenting versus
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.020]   letting children learn from their mistakes.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.700]   And I know I do kind of err on the side of the helicopter parenting.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:05.500]   You know, you should well, let them make some mistakes when the cost is low.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.620]   But I think you should enter personally, I intervene when I think the price of the lesson
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.700]   is too high.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.260]   Some parents like just, you know, they will learn natural consequences of their actions.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.940]   But to me, it's like if they're going to oversleep on the day of their final for high school,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.080]   like I'm not going to wake them up, I'm not going to let them learn the natural consequences
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   of something like that.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.760]   That's, that's too high, in my opinion.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.640]   But if it's something like, you know, they're going to have, they didn't return, I know
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.840]   people don't even do red box DVDs anymore.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.600]   But there was one time when my daughter, you know, I almost I saw it sitting out on the
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   desk.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.640]   I'm like, I'm going to remind her to return and then I like, I had to zip my mouth and
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.440]   you know, I'm not going to remind her because the worst thing that can happen is she's going
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.960]   to pay a little bit of a fine.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   It's not that big a deal.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.160]   But so in that case, when the price is a little bit lower.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.140]   So only you can really draw that line where you think, you know, you need to intervene.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:22:00.120]   But you should definitely look to make a few mistakes, you know, when the cost is low.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.360]   This when I had my kids, we really didn't have to worry about debit cards for teens
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   because you weren't buying anything online when my kids were little.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.360]   But nowadays, a lot of kids want to be able to buy things online.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.880]   And I don't have personal any experience with these cards.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.600]   But I know there's I looked at this one called Fam Zoo, Greenlight, Go Henry, Copper.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.520]   So if anybody at the end of the slide, if you have any experience with any of those,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.840]   let us know.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.480]   And then also someone mentioned Fidelity Youth Account, which is for teens 13 to 17.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.000]   And that does have a free debit card.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.120]   Another dilemma is should you work or encourage your child to work during high school.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.560]   And personally, I know a lot of kids do and that's great personally, like my kids were
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:49.600]   in marching band, and they you know, marching band, you get up and you go at 630 every morning,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.100]   you go to band practice, and then you Friday nights, and sometimes you stay late.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.520]   And to me, that's almost like a job in itself, even though first, they're not getting paid.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.720]   But it's teaching them the same things, I guess, teaching them to get up and go somewhere
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.380]   where even they don't feel like it, teaching them to work hard, teaching them to learn
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.540]   things, teaching them to get along with others.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.640]   So to me, that was kind of teaching the same values as a job and, and it was taking up
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.800]   as much time as a job.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.280]   So you know, you kind of have to just depend on your child, do they have if they have a
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.800]   lot of extra time on their hands, and you might want to encourage them to get a job.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.160]   Does anybody have any comments on any of these topics for teens?
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.600]   Let me see if there were any Keith, go ahead.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.380]   I would just say, and this really came in at the very end with with just our daughter,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:44.520]   you have all these electronic things going on, like Venmo and that type of thing.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.040]   You know, my boys were a little bit older by then, but my daughter was kind of just
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:56.120]   at that, that age where she was learning about money and Venmo and those kind of transfer
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.220]   companies.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.960]   So my comment would be if you're if your kids are young, you probably want to have a strategy
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:10.120]   for those types of things, because right now, they're used a lot, you know, if my one of
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.520]   my kids goes out to eat with his or her friends, somebody pays and then everybody else has
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.240]   the Venmo money to cover their, their cost of their meal.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.400]   I don't have a, I don't have an answer or an opinion.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.200]   It's just that it's out there.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.040]   And you know, if you have a 14 or 15 year old that's learning about money, that's probably
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.880]   going to be something you're going to have to deal with.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.960]   Okay, thank you, Keith.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.520]   Let's see if we had any.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.560]   Okay, we did have two questions from the RSVP questions.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.960]   Okay, strategies to increase children's interest in personal finance and investing.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.040]   So I guess what they're asking is, what if the child you're trying to sit the child down
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.160]   and teach them something and they're just not interested, they just don't care about
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   hearing about that.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.960]   So does anybody have any tips on how to get your children interested in discussing personal
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.920]   finance and investing?
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:18.760]   And this may be one of those things where I know with my my daughter, sometimes it's
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:24.600]   best to teach a lesson when they're they need to know, sometimes they don't care until they
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.120]   need to know like they don't they don't know what a, you know, IRAs, but oh, now all of
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.280]   a sudden, they have a job now they kind of need to know, you know, that kind of thing,
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.720]   or they, or they get their first real job with the 401k.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.600]   And they don't understand, you know, what's this bond index fund?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   What's this?
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   You know, mid cap?
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.800]   I don't know, you know, then they might be more receptive to you explaining and so sometimes
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.960]   it's best to introduce topics when they you know, they need to know, they're definitely
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   gonna be more interested.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.600]   And the other thing I want to say is a lot we're we're gonna this is on another slide,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:02.160]   but oftentimes, you have to explain things, they're not going to get it the first time
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.860]   you have to explain things several times before they it sinks in there.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.320]   These concepts can be very difficult, you know, you know, my, my daughter, like, what's
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   the difference?
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   Like, what is a stock?
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   What is this?
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   I don't understand?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   What is a stock?
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   What is a bond?
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   What's the difference?
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   That kind of thing.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   You have to explain it several times.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.880]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:32.160]   Yes, I, um, what I noticed also is that they the kids, when you mentioned that it takes
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:40.760]   a while for it to sink in it, one thing that happens is when my son, my oldest son, put
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:49.000]   all his money into Vanguard into a stock fund, when he was young, when he had his first accounts.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.160]   And it was a actually it was not, I'm sorry, it was not Vanguard, it was another company
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.860]   that had a stock fund called the young investors fund.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.680]   Stay away from those you every so often, you'll see them.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.360]   These are mutual funds that are stock funds.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.080]   And the manager wants to teach the children how to buy and sell stocks and well, or put
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.440]   it into your mutual fund.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.640]   And they sounded neat, it had this really neat little article that they would send out
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:25.000]   to the kids every month, why I bought Microsoft, why the manager would say this is why I bought
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.600]   Microsoft and he would explain why.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.080]   And then you could write in a question, why don't you buy Macy's?
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.980]   Well, I didn't buy Macy's because of this.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.920]   I thought it was a good education system for my son that he would read it, he would like
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.720]   it and they had cute little bugs running around on the on the papers and stuff like that for
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.840]   the Disney movies.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:55.520]   But what happened was, when the 2000.com bubble came, and his money was in this stock fund,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.240]   he lost 40% of his money.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:03.920]   And I will say right out loud, he had $6,000 in that account, and he lost 40%.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.200]   His account was worth about $3,500 $3,800.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.120]   And actually, he had a good friend who did the same thing.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.520]   He put his money into his, his father was with Merrill Lynch, into a Merrill Lynch stock
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   fund, he lost 50%.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.760]   The only good thing was, I would hear these two kids talking in the bedroom about how
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   awful their parents were encouraging them to go into a stock fund, they lost all their
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.640]   money.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.960]   And trying to explain to my son, no, this is a, a bear market.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.640]   This is a the tech bubble and trying to explain it to him, that you will recoup your money
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.480]   down the road when the market goes back up.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:53.120]   I could tell the horror, the how upset he was at losing his money was worse than any
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.960]   education that it gave him to lose the money.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:08.040]   So what I did was I then, when he turned 16, and he opened his Vanguard taxable account,
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.200]   the money that was left in that young investors fund, it had recouped up to about $5,000.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.360]   We immediately sold that.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.080]   And I sat with him, we sold it, we moved it over to Vanguard, and we put it in Vanguard
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.160]   Wellington, which is a 6040 mutual fund.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.500]   It's not the best for a taxable account.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.160]   But at that point, it served its purpose.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.680]   He saw that money going up, up, up, up, up.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:37.660]   Every time he looked at his statements, he could see he had earned more money.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.880]   At that age, it seems that that is what they want from their investments, from their savings.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.840]   They just want to see that it goes up.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.500]   They don't care if it goes up a little or a lot, they don't know the percentage.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.040]   All they want to know is that each month they made more money, they didn't lose the money.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.400]   And it worked.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:03.760]   And to this day, he's a professional, and he still has that same Vanguard fund, a Vanguard
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.560]   in this taxable account.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:11.760]   It is now worth so much money, he almost can't move it and incur the tax consequences.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.140]   So he doesn't contribute to it, it just builds up on his own by reinvesting dividends and
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.780]   capital gains.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.180]   But it did work.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.540]   He then knows a little bit about asset allocation.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.940]   So that's one thing I would mention about young kids.
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.060]   They don't, they're not going to get the stocks and bonds, they're not going to get what a
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:38.480]   bear market is, or, or inflation, a taxable account versus an IRA, they're not going to
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.520]   get it until they're a little older.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.840]   Thank you, Miriam.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.880]   Yeah, the last thing we want to do is scare our kids off at the get go, just they lose
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   a bunch of money.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.520]   So I'm glad your son kind of after he did the well, it wasn't Wellington and started
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.080]   going up because what we want to do is scare them off of investing for the rest of their
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   lives.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   So that's exactly right.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.320]   Veronica, I see in the chat, you had a question, we're actually going to somebody else, it
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.840]   might have been you had a question from the RSVP.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.520]   So I'm going to cover that later on, like in slide number nine, I actually did a little
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.780]   bit of research and about kids IRA.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.520]   So we're going to cover that later a little bit later.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:22.760]   Okay, and somebody else had a question on how to handle big spenders.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.200]   Does anybody have advice other than just if they don't have, you know, they can only spend
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   what they have.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Right.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.480]   I know, I'll tell a little story about my son, I think we started him at allowance,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.720]   like he was like four, he was young, and we gave him $1 a week at that time.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.600]   Every week, I he wanted me to take him to Walmart and buy a little matchbox car every
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.320]   single week, because they were $1.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.600]   And we let that go on for a good six months, maybe a year.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.560]   And then we kind of said to him, hey, you know what, if you if you don't buy a matchbox
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.360]   car every week, after a while, you'll save up some good amount of money.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.240]   And he actually took that to heart, and he didn't spend any money for like, I don't know,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   until he was like 12.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   And then he bought an Xbox.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   So it was kind of crazy.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.640]   But sometimes you kind of, you know, let them make a mistake.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.720]   And then maybe just explain, hey, you know, if you constantly spend all the money you
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.920]   have, you're never going to be able to save up for anything bigger that you want.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.200]   So if they have something bigger that they want, maybe you could say, hey, you know,
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.640]   if you didn't spend money, or if you only spent half your money for this many weeks
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.000]   or months, you could actually save up for this, whatever item is that they want.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.920]   That's the only suggestion I have about that.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.880]   But anyway, if they have money, you can't stop them, you know, from spending their own
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.480]   money, basically, as long as the item is appropriate, you know, for their age.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.160]   So okay, we're going to move on to
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   Okay, we Oh, sorry, banking, building credit, and some of this has already been discussed
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   a little bit.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.280]   One way to build your child's by credit, I mean, like your credit score, adding your
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.360]   child as an authorized user on your card, and you don't even really even have this bank
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.920]   will send them their own card, but you don't even really have to give it to them.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.120]   And now not all banks will report an authorized user on a credit report, but a lot of them
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   do.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.680]   So you either have to research beforehand, or just do it.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.360]   And then a few months down the road, check their credit report and see if it's on there.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.960]   But if it does, if it does get on there, it will help them build a credit history.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.240]   And then at some point, either high school or college, I know my kids, I think it was
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.720]   right before college, we opened a cup, it was a chase college checking account.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.680]   And it waived all the fees, and they don't have to have a minimum amount in there.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.000]   And I believe it was actually joint with the parents.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.700]   And at the time you open the account, make sure they understand any fees that it may
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   have.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.880]   And also, whether or not you should sign up for overdraft protection, which you may not
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.080]   want to because that can be kind of dangerous if you're not watching your account.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.840]   And a lot of banks charge like a $34 fee.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.240]   And some of them even go to the trouble of arranging the transactions where the smallest
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.880]   ones go first of that each that, you know, the smaller ones will do a $34 fee, and then
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.440]   everyone else will do, they can be really ruthless that way.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.880]   So make sure that you don't have, you probably don't want overdraft protection.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   In most cases.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.760]   The other thing is, you know, back in our day, I still balance my check with the old
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   fashioned way.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.680]   But realistically, I don't think most teenagers are going to be sitting down with a little
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.660]   budget, some, some may, some may, which is great.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.600]   But if they don't balance a checkbook, make sure they at least log on frequently, or more
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.200]   likely, it's going to be on their phone or, you know, check the transaction, make sure
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.080]   nobody got their debit card information or whatever, and make sure they recognize all
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.480]   the transactions and make sure the balance is about what they expect.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.560]   And then also, they should be downloading their bank statements every month and, you
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.240]   know, saving them or printing them out, save them on the computer.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.360]   And when it's time for them to get their first credit card, you know, make sure they understand
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   about in the high interest rate, you know, try to encourage them to pay it off every
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.240]   month, you definitely don't want them to build up a larger balance or really any kind of
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.600]   a balance.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   You know, let them know they do have a credit limit, but which does help build their credit
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.800]   and their credit score.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.760]   But that doesn't necessarily mean they should, you know, charge up to the credit limit.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.480]   And then if your teen doesn't qualify for a secure, you know, an unsecured card, there
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:35.280]   are secured card, which I got this information from Clark Howard, I listened to him, and
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:41.240]   he has a lot of information about secured cards like Petal Chime, what's one called
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.760]   Discover it Secured.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.000]   And then when it's time, show them how to check their credit report through and make
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.160]   sure they only go to the annualcreditreport.com and not one time I accidentally somehow went
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.720]   to one of them that wasn't the right one and nothing really bad happened.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.240]   I realized that, oh, I shouldn't have gone to that one.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.920]   So I'm trying to be real careful to go to the right one.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.040]   It'll say like, this is the official, this is the only official website for the government,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.120]   you know, it'll be a thing on there.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.520]   And then to protect their credit, make sure they understand, warn them about scam emails,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   because that's a lot of times that's how people get your information or get a little virus
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.160]   on your computer, you know, never, unless you're expecting a very specific email that
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.440]   you just did something you're expecting an email, don't ever click on, or click on things
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.160]   in emails or call numbers back from phone if you're, if your bank calls and says, you
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.240]   know, we think you had a fraudulent transaction, you know, is this right?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.960]   You should look at the number on the back of your credit card and call that number instead
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.360]   don't ever call the number that they tell you to, because they could even be spoofing
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.000]   the number and it might look like it's the bank on the phone, but it's really not.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.120]   Same thing with emails or text, you should never click on a link, always go directly
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.760]   to the bank's website.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.120]   And I never do banking on my phone, but I think I don't know if that's realistic to
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.000]   tell teenagers never to do anything on their phone, because they do seem to do almost everything
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.320]   on their phone.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:20.760]   Does anybody have any input on suggestions on maybe good credit cards for teams how to
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.560]   build their credit, that kind of thing, what kind of, what to warn them about when getting
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.240]   a credit card?
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:34.560]   Let's see if anybody's, go ahead Miriam.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.920]   One way to build good credit is to buy your own car.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   And what my husband and I did we, we decided that we would purchase each of our children,
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.320]   we would purchase their first car for them.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.200]   And then from that point on, they were on their own.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:59.680]   So we then learned that if they purchase it in their name, even though we fund it for
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.760]   them, they do get a good credit, you know, the credit report, they get the credit for
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:11.520]   it and paying off a large sum of money, like a car loan over the years, you know, month
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.800]   by month by month, even though you would put like maybe 50% down payment and then just
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.400]   have maybe one or two years of payments, they can build their credit that way.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.760]   Now, they are paying interest on that.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.440]   But you know, then you decide what to do, maybe pay enough so that they only have a
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:37.720]   year's payments for their Toyota or their Camry, whatever it is, and paying it off monthly.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.400]   Then on the credit report, it looks like a very, very good loan that was paid off, it
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.680]   was a car loan, and it was paid off on time, you know, over the course of a year.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.720]   Thank you, Miriam.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.840]   Beverly and Tim, go ahead.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   Two things.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   When our kids were in college, I suggested that they each get one or two credit cards
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:08.640]   before they graduated, because the day after graduation, you're significantly less appealing
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.160]   to all of the credit cards.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.480]   So they listened and they did that, and NerdWallet is a place where you can find not only our
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.840]   criteria are not only free credit cards, but credit cards that have some kind of cash back
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   reward.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   And the other thing that we asked our daughters to do was to get a loan during college, and
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.760]   they didn't want to do that.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   And now they regret it, because when it came to get mortgages, they wish they had a better
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   credit history.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.360]   They do have an excellent outstanding credit score, despite all that, but, you know, one
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.800]   of them has a specific number in mind, and she's like, I could have gotten over that,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.600]   you know, that five-point thing if I'd only gotten that college loan, like you said, Mom.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:59.720]   She never came as, you know, she never said you were right, Mom, but she came really close.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.400]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.960]   Okay, let's move on.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   The next slide is, I think it's the one Miriam was, oh, just the one you were talking about,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   Miriam.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.920]   So Miriam, you said, if I remember correctly, you bought your kids the first car, and then
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.520]   they were on their own after that, right?
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.320]   I think that's a great way, because then when they have the car, they, you know, one thing
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.480]   they might want to consider doing is after they get the first car, immediately start
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:32.040]   putting aside money every month, and then in 10 years, they'll have plenty enough to
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.800]   pay cash for the second car, so that's one way to do it, but there's several different
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.200]   ways to do it, and I kind of changed my mind, my first, my thought was, oh, I'm not going
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.000]   to buy my kids a car, but then we ended up, I changed my mind, so, but there's a couple
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   things you can do.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.720]   You can give or sell them your old car instead of trading it in, but then you have to kind
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.800]   of balance, well, it's an older car, it may not have as many of the safety features of
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:00.280]   the newer car, like the, our cars have those little blind spot, the little tiny mirror
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.920]   within the mirror, the blind spot mirror, some of them have the backup cameras and things
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.420]   like that, that make, make it safe for more airbags and things like that, or if you have
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.960]   enough cars within your family, you could just share, share maybe a family car with
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.960]   them.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.160]   If they do buy it, you want to make sure they understand, like I had, my daughter, she hasn't
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.480]   bought a car yet, but she was talking about it, I'm like, do you understand about, well,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:28.680]   now, all bets are off right now in this environment, but, you know, two years ago, before this,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.880]   all the supply chain problems, you would look up the MSRP on the internet and you might
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.260]   pay your dealer a hundred dollars over the, you know, you never paid sticker price, cars,
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.640]   you never paid sticker price, but, you know, you wouldn't, if you've never been shopping
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.240]   for a car before, you might not necessarily know that, so, and these days it's great,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.800]   there's so much things you can do on the internet to price things out and order directly, or
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.040]   there's different things you can do, and then if they do get a car loan, you know, don't
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:42:00.600]   necessarily get one from the dealer, you might want to shop around for a credit union, you
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:06.520]   could also consider them either lending money with interest or without interest, and then
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:12.360]   you definitely want to make it clear who pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas, and that's
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.000]   kind of up to each family as to whether or not you just want to put them on your insurance
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.580]   and pay for it, you know, that's up to each family, but just make it clear ahead of time
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.080]   who's paying for what, and also who's paying for the deductible if they have an accident,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:34.660]   and it's, a lot of cases, it's a good idea to have them pay for it so that it really,
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.600]   you know, you want them to be extra careful when they drive, and of course it's not always
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.680]   their fault if they have an accident, but you do, you know, you want them to, that you
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:48.880]   want that to be kind of painful to have to pay that deductible. Does anybody have any
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.680]   tips, and Miriam, you gave some great tips on buying the first car, does anybody, Keith,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.320]   go ahead. Yeah, so like Miriam, you know, we helped
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.120]   our kids buy their first car, we put some money in, and then they actually used some
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   money that they had saved up from, you know, holidays and birthdays and various things
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.400]   like that. One of the things I would mention, having been in the automobile business, is
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.500]   if your child is getting ready to graduate college, a lot of times there'll be additional
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:30.140]   rebates or incentives available for "recent college graduates." There's also, do you want
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:35.720]   to co-sign a loan to help your child or not, you know, do you want to have that liability
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.080]   of being on the loan, that's something you want to think about. As far as insurance,
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:48.200]   when we did this for our kids, what I found is that up until the age of 25, if they insure
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:57.080]   the car under their name only, it's very expensive, and it usually helps a lot with the cost of
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.480]   insurance if they're kind of part of your family. But obviously, if something were to
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.840]   happen, it affects your rates also, so that's something else to consider. But there are
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:15.920]   a lot of ways that you can help them, like I say, with, you know, various incentives
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:22.320]   that car manufacturers have and special loans for recent college graduates, etc. Same thing
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.520]   if you're in the military. So look for some of those special deals that can apply to your
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:34.240]   kids that might help them if they are shopping around for a new car or a, you know, relatively
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:43.120]   late model used car that they have to finance. Those are great tips, Keith. Thank you. Okay,
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:52.000]   the next slide is basically college funding, and this could be an entire topic for meeting
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   on its own, so we're not going to go into any detail. But one thing I was reading is
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.040]   it's important to prepare your kids well in advance. Some said, you know, middle school,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.800]   we're talking about it, how much you're going to help, you know, you might want to say,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.680]   oh, you know, we've saved up enough for you to attend a state school, or we've saved up
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.620]   for you to attend a two-year community college, and then you're on for the rest, or whatever
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:20.720]   it is that you've decided you can cover, just let them know so that they don't pick out
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.480]   the most, you know, expensive private school, and then it's only after they've got accepted
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.760]   then you let them know that, you know, you're not going to cover that. So just, you know,
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:36.640]   set their expectations. 529s can also be used, not everybody wants to go to college or is
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.280]   right for college, so 529s can also be used for accredited trade and vocational school.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.960]   That's always a good, sometimes a good option for kids. One tip I've heard for saving money
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.720]   is consider a community college for the first two years, preferably with living at home,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.200]   but just make sure that the credits will transfer because they don't always. And the child should
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.320]   research and apply for scholarships. I remember when I was in college, of course, this was
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:05.280]   a long time ago, but somehow I saw this very small, you know, it was a kind of very modest
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.440]   scholarship, and I think, oh, you had to write an essay. I'm thinking, oh, I'll never get
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.160]   that, but I did, and for some reason, like, I'm sure there's multiple ones, but I was
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   surprised that I actually got the modest scholarship, but every little bit, you know, helps. So
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.440]   in similar to high school, there's, you know, whether the child should work in college,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.960]   and to me, it's the same as in high school, where it's highly dependent on your course
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:33.120]   load, your extracurricular activities, and then the necessities. Sometimes it's necessary.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.360]   Sometimes the course load isn't that tough, and, you know, 20 hours a week is easy to
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.800]   fit in. So some parents really feel that the child will take college more seriously if
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.360]   they're paying for part of it, which could be true for a lot of children, but on the
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.280]   other hand, some children are very internally motivated to do well regardless, and if they
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.000]   have a really heavy load, you know, it may not be right for them to have a job, so it's
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.360]   very highly dependent on the child and the situation. College loans, if your child does
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.560]   get one, just make sure that they really understand how much it is. Some children just don't,
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.320]   even if a 20, 19-year-old, they might not have an idea, like, what is 100,000? What
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:20.720]   is 150,000? They might not really comprehend what that is. Kind of maybe have them research
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.400]   what their, the career that they're wanting to go in, how much it pays, and then say,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.000]   well, you know, you don't get that whole amount. You got to pay taxes and FICA taxes, and then
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.560]   you probably want to put some away to your 401(k), so after it's all said and done, your
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.720]   take-home pay is going to be this much. Kind of calculate how long it's going to take them
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:44.580]   to pay off the college loan, and then, you know, you may end up paying three times, twice
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.720]   as much as the loan amount in interest, and make sure they understand all that, so they're
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:54.160]   kind of going, if they do get a loan, they're going into it kind of with their eyes open.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:01.040]   One tip I do have is don't put 100% of needed money into 529. There's still, and I did research
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.600]   in it, I do believe it's been made permanent, but it is still in effect the American Opportunity
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:12.440]   Tax Credit, which is, it's not even a deduction, it's an actual credit of up to $2,500, but
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.880]   if you're covering the entire amount under the 529 plan, you don't qualify for that tax
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:24.080]   credit because that money has that, to qualify for the tax credit, you have to pay part of
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:30.200]   the college expenses with money that's not, what is it called, qualified or is not coming
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.520]   from a qualified plan. It has to be outside the plan, so, you know, try to hold back a
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:39.400]   little bit. If you're planning to fully fund, you know, don't necessarily put 100% into
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.000]   the 529, maybe hold back a little bit in one of your taxable accounts. And I think I did
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.080]   mention, yeah, have the child research salaries, when deciding on a career, and don't necessarily
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:54.280]   rule out, you know, don't necessarily discourage them from becoming one of the lower paid careers,
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.600]   but just, you know, make sure they go in with an understanding. You may need to adjust your,
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.320]   you know, your lifestyle, you may not be jet setting to Europe every year, and you may
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.160]   not have a big fancy house, but just make sure they understand that, you know, the salary
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:12.120]   versus the lifestyle. And then this is always a tough one. What if you have one child that
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:17.000]   becomes a teacher, when another child goes to medical school and law school, if you fund
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.760]   both of them 100%, you know, you have to figure out for yourself, is that is that really fair?
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.000]   Because the, you know, one child may go on to make a higher salary. And, you know, it's
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.880]   very tricky, it's a very tricky situation. And I definitely don't have any answers. But
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.240]   it's just something to consider. Kind of before you, you know, help the first child, you kind
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.520]   of want to maybe have a plan for all the children to make sure everything is, is fair. Does
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.440]   anybody have any? I do have a couple comments from the RSVP. But does anybody have any comments
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.960]   on this slide? Go ahead, Keith.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.560]   Yeah, I'll just just really quickly mention on the scholarships, I've had three kids that
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:59.260]   have gone through this process, my youngest is currently in college now. And there's something
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.760]   called a merit scholarship, but not every college offers it. So if you have kids that
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.640]   are going to be future college, college students, and you're going to be starting that process,
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:15.080]   I told my kids that you had to go to a college that offered a merit scholarship, it's usually
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:23.520]   based on your GPA in high school. And there's a dollar amount that is essentially discounted
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:30.520]   from the price of tuition, based on that GPA. Each of the three schools that my kids went
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:37.240]   to had different amounts that they received. But they were all in the 1000s or 10s of 1000s
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:46.160]   of dollars per year. So over the course of four years, it was a substantial discount,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:54.040]   so to speak, off of the, you know, the stated price. So always look for merit scholarships
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.120]   if it's available at the colleges that your your your children are going to be looking
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:06.000]   at. And then of course, if you had, you know, any any local for the town or where you work
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.580]   at the company that I work for had one you could apply for, it was only a few $1,000,
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:16.480]   but it was worth applying for. So always look for that, but especially the merit scholarships,
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.560]   because you'd be surprised. There are quite a few schools that do not offer that. And
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:27.320]   there are and then the rest of them do, but the amounts vary pretty significantly. But
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:33.400]   it's worth looking into because it could save you 20 30 $40,000 over the course of four
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   years.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:42.460]   Very good. Thank you, Keith. Yeah, speaking of the merit scholarships, the college my
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:49.460]   son went to gave, they had this tier level based purely on your SAT score, the higher
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:54.100]   they gave a merit scholarship, and the higher it was, the more the more they covered. And
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:59.460]   then also, I've heard that if your child is lucky enough, not, you know, lucky enough,
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:06.080]   you're working enough to be a national merit scholar. There are some colleges that will
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.280]   give you 100% tuition or sometimes tuition on board room and board merit scholarship
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:21.520]   just based on that. We have a couple of questions from the RCPs. I think we kind of covered
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.720]   my one wanted to know private versus public school, my kids both went to public schools.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.540]   So I don't know a whole lot about private schools. I know they do tend to give out a
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:37.220]   lot more. I think they give a lot of scholarships. But of course, that doesn't guarantee scholarship.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:46.980]   But does anybody have any comments on private versus public schools? Okay, the other question
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:51.020]   from RCP was, I'd like to start investing for kids retirement, but I don't want to mess
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:57.460]   up college financial aid or any best practices. And I did find an article, how students IRA
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:02.160]   is counted for financial aid, it's a Kip Winter article. And I'm just going to read read the
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.300]   this one couple sentences. Assets in an IRA, whether held by the parent or the student
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:15.460]   are excluded from financial aid calculations. IRA withdrawals, on the other hand, are included
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:22.260]   in the income calculation on the federal financial aid forms. Money withdrawn from a child's
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:27.740]   IRA is considered to be the student's income and is hit hard by the financial aid calculation.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:33.500]   So in other words, having money in an IRA is fine, as long as you don't take it out
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:39.180]   the year that it's going to show up on the FAFSA. That's what I get from that. So it's
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.060]   not a problem that they have. It won't even be counted at all if they just have an IRA
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:53.620]   money in an IRA and keep it there. Okay, let's go to the next slide. Okay, so now they've
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:54:01.860]   graduated and their job interviewing. And this is something if they've never been to
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.540]   I mean, I guess I call this a real job. I mean, not that working at McDonald's isn't
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.500]   a real job. But I think it's a slightly different kind of an interview if you're going to go
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:16.340]   to a big corporate job versus going to McDonald's. But you may want to encourage your child to
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:21.700]   do a little bit of research. Because there's a I'm sure you just research, you know, what
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.620]   are some common interview questions? You know, one of the most common is what are your weaknesses?
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.620]   And if the child's never really thought about that, and then, of course, you got a word
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.660]   in such a way that it's, here's a weakness, but here's how I overcome it. So that doesn't
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:38.140]   look like it's a bad thing. What made you want to interview with this company, but there's
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.980]   going to be a whole list of very common interview questions that they should be prepared to
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:46.140]   answer. And I've also read, they should always do a little bit of research on the company
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.340]   to have questions to ask the interview about the company and also to explain how they can
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:57.140]   contribute to the specific company. And then, you know, help them shop for appropriate interview
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:03.700]   attire. And there's a lot of articles out there on job interviewing and also tips on
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.580]   salary negotiation, which is a very tough thing if you've never done it before, and
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:14.380]   I'm really bad at it. So that's why you probably want to encourage child to just read up some
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.900]   tips. I'm sure there's plenty of articles out there with tips on that kind of thing.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:23.940]   And then also, if you have any contacts as far as friends, neighbors, co-workers that
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.980]   are even that are working for that company that they're interviewing or just in that
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.380]   field or the position that your child's going to be interviewing for, you could maybe have
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:38.660]   them go out to lunch with them or just have a phone conversation, just get some tips on,
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.320]   you know, whether or not they want that kind of position, whether or not they want to work
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:48.660]   for that company, some kind of tips on interviewing, that kind of thing. Anybody have any tips?
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:59.300]   Miriam, go ahead. Yes, there are counselors and tutors who help people learn how to interview.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.180]   And I think especially when they come out of college, when they come out of high school
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:10.220]   for kids, it might be useful to pay for some sessions to help them learn the interview
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.460]   process, what is appropriate, what is not appropriate, how to answer certain kinds of
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:22.900]   questions, how to read when they're in the interview, how to read how it's going, how
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:26.860]   to learn ahead of time about the company that you're interviewing for or the job or the
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:33.980]   position so that the employer, prospective employer thinks you're excited about the job.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:40.380]   I think that's a useful way of approaching it. Great tip. I don't know if I thought I
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.700]   would have thought of that. So that's a great tip. And it's probably well worth any small
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:48.420]   amount that you would spend on that for, like you said, one or two sessions. It may not
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:54.580]   have mattered so much, but nowadays it's so competitive. I think it's a useful, a useful
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:57:02.740]   thing to do. Definitely. OK, so great. Now they have the first job, like the real first
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:09.940]   job. And I know I think it was Miriam you talked about this, but or other people talking
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:16.500]   about this, but consider matching or because most children aren't going to be positioned
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.460]   when they get their first job to contribute to the 401(k) and also a Roth outside of it.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:27.300]   They may be, but if you were able to, it'd be and you want to, it would be a good thing
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:33.620]   to match their earned income into a Roth. And this applies to even high school jobs
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.900]   that they have, any job that they have, because most children, if they're working at McDonald's
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.460]   in high school, they're not going to want to put all their earned income into a Roth.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.120]   What fun is that? They want to be able to have some spending money. So but you really
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:53.460]   don't want to pass up. You only get so much, so much, so many opportunities in your life
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:57.740]   to contribute to a Roth. There's only so much per year. So you want to start that as it's
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:04.900]   well worth it with the compounding, compounding nature of that kind of especially tax free.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:11.740]   So if you're able, it's a great thing to match earned income into a Roth. And I kind of keep
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:17.460]   track of my kids because I want anything that would give them to kind of be, you don't want
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.620]   it to be fair and equal. So over the years, I keep track, you know, this child, I put
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:26.500]   this much into the Roth or whatever. And then, of course, you make sure once they get a real
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:33.140]   job that there's enough. If if they put all their money, not that they could, if they
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:37.060]   put all their money into a 401(k), they couldn't, you couldn't contribute to a Roth. There has
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:42.300]   to be basically, what is it, six thousand, seven thousand, is it six thousand or seven
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:48.140]   thousand dollars on their W-2 that shows up as income for you to be able to contribute
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:52.300]   to the Roth. And it's kind of funny, I had to explain to my daughter, it doesn't have
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.580]   to be the same six. Like she's like, well, that's not my money. Like I can't you know,
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:00.380]   it doesn't have to be the same six thousand dollars. It can be a different six thousand
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:05.580]   dollars, but it can't be more than that. Now, when they sign up for their job, they're usually
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:10.480]   going to have a lot of choices to make as far as choosing if they're lucky enough to
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.580]   get benefits, choosing health plans, there's going to be all these, you know, high deductible,
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.620]   low deductible. There's going to be one that has a better prescription plan. It's going
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:25.300]   to be complicated. There's going to be one that has an FHA where it costs more, but the
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:34.220]   employer puts in five hundred dollars towards their HSA or the FSA. And if they don't have
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.940]   experience with health insurance, they may not even know what's a deductible, what's
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:45.100]   a copay, what's a coinsurance, what is the negotiated discount, what's an EOB. And you're
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:50.180]   probably going to have to explain all this. And this is probably one of those things that
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:55.980]   they're not going to be able to absorb the information until they need to know. And a
[00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:01.180]   good idea would be once they go to the doctor, show them, you know, you can log on your insurance,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:07.820]   you can print out your EOB. Here's here's the full price of this lab test was I always
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.620]   get them. They're like three hundred dollars negotiated. But after the negotiated discount,
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:18.620]   it's only thirty dollars. And then just kind of explain all that, because that's very confusing
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:23.460]   and very confusing. And then they're going to have to decide how much to contribute to
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:30.660]   their 401k. They may have options as far as pre-tax Roth. They may not understand what
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.700]   the company match, how many years it takes to vest. If they're going to quit, you know,
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.140]   two years and eleven months in a job and it's best in three years. You want to know that
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.380]   because if you only have to stay an extra month to get investing, you might as well.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.860]   So that's a good thing to know. When they get the first paycheck, you know, you're going
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.380]   to kind of want to go through their paycheck stuff with them and explain or, you know,
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.580]   better yet, even before they go to, you know, just because you're making fifty thousand
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:01.460]   a year, you're not getting fifty thousand a year. They may not understand what FICA
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:06.740]   is. They most most of them have an idea on federal income tax, but it all comes out of
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.740]   the paycheck. They're going to have health insurance. They have to usually pay a little
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:18.940]   bit of their health insurance. They're going to have 401k taken out, FICA, tax withholding,
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.780]   and then explain to them the tax withholding. That's not necessarily you kind of have to
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.460]   settle up with the government at the end of the year. You may get some back. You may have
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:33.860]   to pay more. So let them make their own choices after you explain everything. But as we stated
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:39.220]   earlier, kind of. If they're procrastinating, if they're not getting around to it and you
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:43.340]   really think, obviously, if they never, ever sign up for 401k, that price would be too
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.100]   high. You don't know, wait five or 10 years. Oh, did you ever sign up? Oh, no, I never
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.020]   got around to that kind of you're going to have to nag them if they don't do it, because
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.900]   that's definitely something that the price would be too high to to skip out on that if
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:01.060]   they don't ever get around to doing that. Does anybody have any tips on helping your
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.500]   child navigate, you know, getting set up for the first job and getting all their benefits
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:14.300]   signed up if they're lucky enough to have them? Any tips? Okay. Mary, go ahead. I have
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:24.100]   found that with my kids and with their friends, they do not realize that when they retire,
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:31.020]   they are not going to retire like my husband and I retire because we have pensions and
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:39.420]   also because we diligently saved in addition to the pensions. And nowadays, the employers
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:46.980]   do not you know, there are very few pensions out there. And the the goal is by from employers
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:53.100]   is to have the employees save for their own retirement to these different plans. And my
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:58.940]   kids always had the attitude of, well, don't worry, Mom, I will. I'll have plenty of money
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:05.300]   in retirement. Don't worry. I'm going to get a good job. I'll be fine. And they they obviously,
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:15.540]   you know, they do not get it. And our I simply would lay out anything I found any graphs
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:24.940]   any any spreadsheets that I found that were appropriate for teenagers and for college
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:32.140]   kids to show them what compounding does over time, you have to have that money in the account
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:37.780]   to compound. And then the more you have in that account to compound, the more you will
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:44.220]   make. Don't you want to make money? And don't you want to have that for your retirement?
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:48.860]   Because otherwise, you will be and that's when you give them Bill Bernstein's book.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.940]   And it says on the first page or the second page, you will be living under a bridge eating
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:04:00.020]   cat food, you have to save a certain portion of your money over the longest period of time.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:07.060]   And then that money works for you. And they will get it when they see this happening.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:16.340]   And they only see it happening if they contribute to a 401k, or to a five or 457 B, or to a
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:22.340]   not even an IRA over time. And then you just lay out those statements, you lay out the
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.940]   graphs if you can print it out on Morningstar on Vanguard or fidelity, and you print it
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:32.300]   out and you show them how the contributions even though they may be small, every year
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:38.980]   add up. And even now this is a good time I show my kids on there. My especially my youngest
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:45.560]   son is a Schwab 401k. It's really, really interesting to show him the graph from when
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:52.900]   he started that job to today. If you look at you select that graph and you show him
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:05:00.640]   what it points out the one year your one year earnings, and it shows the graph of his contributions
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:07.300]   and his market value of his account is 401k. Well, most of it is in red, it's down below,
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:15.260]   he's lost money, he's lost 16% this year, his what is it called his whatever it's called
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:21.880]   his what he's earned this year is down 16%. But if you change that graph to the time he
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:27.860]   began his job there to today, which has been about three years, three and a half years,
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.760]   well, it looks very different. The graph looks beautiful. It shows him contributing and the
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:38.720]   market value going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up to today goes down a little bit.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.740]   So he can see that while it looks like the world is ending today, financially on Wall
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:50.620]   Street, in his account, it's not. And it's not because he's contributing regularly, little
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:56.140]   by little every month, it's he's contributing every paycheck, actually, he's contributing.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:02.700]   And because it's invested in, well, he's in mostly stocks, so it's mostly going up. Now
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:09.180]   I can get into later on, if anybody wants, we did an experiment with bonds, two types
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:14.420]   of bonds. So try to teach him a little bit about that. And also, I'm learning from that
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   too. But most is 80 to 90% stocks. So it goes up, and then his Vanguard account, anyway,
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:29.700]   you can make a huge amount of money. These kids can make a lot of money if they are consistent
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:36.680]   in contributing as much as they can early on. And Jonathan Clements had a wonderful
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:45.560]   article years ago about how if the kids could, if they do that now, they may then not buy
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:53.300]   the big TVs, buy a smaller TV, not buy a new phone every year, hold on to it, be more frugal
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.140]   be more careful in your spending when you're young. It's not as much fun, especially if
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:04.460]   you have a group of friends who like to go out and have fun and spend money. But when
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:10.500]   you are in your 40s and 50s, and you are really tired of working, especially if you are tired
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:21.100]   of working at the same job for 20 years, 25 years, you will not feel so it will not be
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:27.980]   such a terrible thing. If you step back and take a sabbatical, maybe change jobs in your
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:35.260]   50s. If you're a techie, you may not have any choice, you may be your company may hire
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:40.380]   young techs just out of college, two of them for the price of you. So you may be you may
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:48.340]   be unwillingly downsized. At that point, when you're in your 50s, you won't be so you won't
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.540]   just panic that you haven't saved enough for retirement, you will look at your account
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:59.160]   and you will realize over the years, the account worked for you. It made money by compounding
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:04.620]   over time. And you can take a little breather, you can take a little break and not panic.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.940]   Or you can continue on and cut back just a little. In other words, you have more options,
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:16.040]   you have more flexibility, rather than so you have to look ahead. These kids don't want
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.580]   to look ahead. But around the dinner table, my husband and I can talk about looking ahead
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:31.020]   and not suggesting that they do it just pointing out that it could be done. Among friends,
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:35.100]   you know, bring bring your kids in with your friends and talk about things, bring them
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.680]   to the bogo heads conference. There's a young kid in high school who used to come with his
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:47.800]   dad to the conferences. So that's what I see with my kids. And what I see with their accounts.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:57.720]   Also, the 401ks are normally pre tax normally. And then the IRA we use are the Roth IRAs,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:02.700]   which are after tax. The good thing about that is that when they get close to retirement,
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:10.920]   they will have both a good amount of pre tax a good amount of after tax. And then the net
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:17.740]   another good thing is that if they contribute as much as they can to 401k, that is taken
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:24.220]   out before taxes on their paycheck. That means if they have a little paycheck like this,
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:31.780]   but you have little taxes to your taxes are lower. So you have a more money available
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:37.740]   to you to spend right now from your paycheck, because you're not paying it for taxes. So
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.100]   you know, you can show them this and then, you know, help them with their 401k asset
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:48.340]   allocation, mostly stocks, maybe some bonds. And it will work if they stick with it, they
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.860]   will see don't make them open up that statement and show them how it works. It really does
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   work.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:10:00.540]   Thank you, Miriam. Just the only thing I want to add is, it's so hard when you're young
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.260]   to realize that you are actually gonna be old when they didn't, you know what I'm saying?
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:10.100]   Like, it's just, you know, that theoretically, when you're 20, you're going to be 70 when
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.660]   it but it's hard to you know what I mean? You know, it's just a hard concept to it seems
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:26.100]   so far away. So thank you so much for all that. All those tips, Miriam. Okay, so I guess
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:33.020]   the goal would be to eventually they would move out. If they do continue to live at home,
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:38.900]   you do want to set clear expectations as to a timeframe, who pays for what and does what
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.620]   towards and this is not necessary, you know, this could be a great thing, because it could
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:47.060]   allow them to save up a lot more money the first couple of years after college or after
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:52.580]   high school, by living at home. But just make sure that you have a timeframe that agreed
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.260]   upon by everybody. Well, I guess it doesn't even have to be agreed upon by a child. It's
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.300]   up to the, it's your house. So it's up to you to set the timeframe. And then also who
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.980]   pays for what does what chores, you know, if you want them to do a little bit of work
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.580]   around there, you know, whether or not most people don't make them break out everything
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.700]   you buy the grocery store, this is for you know, you drank a cup of milk, you know, you're
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:18.740]   probably not going to do that. But if they buy anything major, maybe, you know, at the
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:24.620]   store, you can want to reimburse have them reimburse that that kind of thing. Usually
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.940]   these days, a lot of kids you're going to be they're going to be on the car insurance,
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:33.900]   the cell phone plan, we have like the toll tag plan that my kids are actually still on
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:40.860]   our toll tag. You just kind of set forth rules about when they're going to kind of ideally
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.220]   they want to separate from all these plans. Well, like I think was keep that was saying,
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.860]   a lot of times it just makes sense to keep them on the country is gonna be cheaper overall.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.700]   I think I have a thing later. But like with the cell phone, we got, you know, for grandfathered
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:57.500]   into a great plan. And that's a family plan. And it would cost them so much more to get
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:02.380]   their own just to get their own, you know, wine, just you know, and it's only $25 a month.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.620]   It's just it's no big deal either way. So you can keep them on. It's no big deal. Some
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:12.380]   you're gonna have to explain to them if they don't have health insurance with their job.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:16.420]   Why they need even Oh, I'm healthy. I don't need health insurance, they get explained
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:20.860]   why they need it. You know, even if they're healthy, they have a major accident or they
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:24.320]   could have a heart attack, it's gonna it's gonna bankrupt them and wipe out everything
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.940]   they have. So just explain to them, encourage them to get a plan through the ACA. They don't
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:35.460]   have one through work, even if it's of course, the highest deductible they can get. When
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:41.620]   they're moving out, they may need a little bit of they may not realize what all expenses
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:49.340]   are going to be involved. They may not realize they have to pay, you know, gas, water, sewer,
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:55.100]   garbage, electricity, you know, internet, they may just take it for granted that, you
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:00.700]   know, they been taking that for granted while living with you. If they're not already know
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:04.620]   how to use a spreadsheet, this is a great time to Oh, here's a little spreadsheet. Here's
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.740]   how I do my monthly budget. And then you can show them make maybe make a simple spreadsheet
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:13.860]   and show them how to do that. And they may not think ahead. But, you know, in addition
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:18.640]   to just your monthly expenses, you're going to want to kind of set aside month money for
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.420]   long term things like new cars, vacations, gifts, things like that. That's all part of
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:27.660]   your budget, even though you may not necessarily spend that every month. And now I don't use
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.020]   any of this. But I know there's a lot of budget software out there like YNAB, which is you
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:37.220]   need a budget. I've also heard of Monarch, Money Danceman, Every Dollar Spreadsheet.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:41.240]   So if anybody has any experience with any of these, please raise your hand after the
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.900]   slide. And then make sure they have a method of remembering to pay the bills because of
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.540]   course, one of the worst things you can do for your credit score is to, you know, forget
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:58.180]   to pay your credit card bill on time. If they do buy a house, explain and make sure they
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.340]   understand all the there's so many expenses with buying and maintaining a house, you got
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:06.940]   mortgage, property tax, insurance, maintenance, HOA fees, utility, lawn care, there's just
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:12.860]   so much and then as far as closing for the house, there's going to be closing costs,
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:19.860]   PMI, escrow for mortgage, mortgage payments, insurance and property tax. And then also
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.420]   like with the other budget expenses, they should be setting aside money, you know, in
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:28.580]   20 years, you're going to need a new air conditioner, a new roof, a new fence, new washer, dryer,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:35.620]   there's just so much to save up for when you have a house. And then, you know, but I mean,
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.900]   a little bit of reminders, you might have some a lot of maintenance, you got to do,
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.740]   you know, we have our air conditioner service twice a year, you got to change your filters,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:48.340]   that kind of thing, smoke detector batteries. If you're in a position to help with the down
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.100]   payment, that would be a good, a good thing to help them out with that just to give them
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.380]   a little boost. And we're going to talk about that later, you know, these little boosts
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:02.500]   we can give our children with without, you know, spoiling them or giving them subsidizing
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.100]   them too much. We're going to kind of talk about that later. Does anybody have any tips
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:13.660]   on helping your child when it comes time to move out? Oh, yeah, Miriam, you have information
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.700]   on that, don't you?
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:22.780]   Yes, yes. One thing is, we have to remember is that our children, most of our children,
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:30.200]   they grow up in a different environment, a different time than we did. When my husband
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:36.780]   and I got, you know, got married, and we were out of college, we lived, you know, our apartments
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:41.260]   were furnished with wood from Home Depot and bricks, you know, those were our shelves.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:46.100]   Sometimes it was the pantry in the kitchen, too. And, you know, we would have to save
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:51.020]   up just to buy little things. And I remember we would make our coffee with instant coffee,
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.580]   boiling water on the stove, you know, making instant coffee until my mom said, you know,
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:00.420]   really, you guys really have to have a coffee maker. And she bought us a little Mr. Coffee.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:07.100]   So our kids, when they move out, I've noticed, they want the TV, first of all, they want
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   a big TV, not a little one, a big TV. Obviously, they have their computers and their cell phones.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.700]   They want the kitchen already, you know, they want everything in the kitchen already, including
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:28.660]   a blender and this, they want the whole apartment set up as our nice suburban family home. But
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:35.220]   our nice suburban family home is the result of 40 years, 50 years of working and saving
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:42.340]   and cluttering up the house. And so there is a tendency for the kids to say, well, I'll
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:49.500]   just put it on the credit card, and then I'll pay it off. So then starts the cycle of credit,
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:56.140]   the cycle of not saving for something, the cycle of buying it now, and then putting it
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:17:03.900]   on credit. So that is very difficult for some kids. And I mentioned that my kids all they're
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:10.420]   all different. And some get it right away. And they would not put they're just really
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.460]   careful about their credit cards. And others, the other other ones are more, I'll just put
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:23.900]   it on the credit card, I can pay it off, I have a good job. But meanwhile, the 401k suffers.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.980]   You know, they're not putting their money as we would prefer. They're not balancing
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:34.220]   out as we would prefer. They're not their priorities are different. My family, my parents
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:40.740]   and most of our parents grew up in the depression. And my mother told me that she, her mother
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:46.140]   would have to stuff her shoes with cardboard, because there was no money to put new soles
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.980]   on the shoes, let alone buy new shoes. Now you just put it on the credit card, go buy
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:18:00.300]   a new pair of shoes. So it is people have told me in on the bogleheads form, there are
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:08.620]   so many threads of how, how it is to let your children know that to realize that you're
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.340]   our children grow up in a different environment, and that they are just used to having all
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:20.860]   this good stuff, as if they are entitled to it. I don't know, I know, we try hard not
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:25.540]   to, to let them see that that's not the way it is. But it is hard, because that is the
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:33.420]   way they all grow up. That's the way their friends are. In terms of another way of that,
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.180]   what I would do with my kids, I realized in high school, they didn't have a clue how much
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:45.560]   a roof cost. They didn't have a clue how much a car really cost. I started putting our bills
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.660]   on the kitchen counter. If we had to have the roof cleaned, the bill went on the kitchen
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:54.140]   counter. And they would look and they would say $600 to clean the roof. Are you kidding?
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:58.500]   I can have my friends, we can walk down, we can just, well, it doesn't work like that.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:05.440]   And $6,000 for a new roof catches their eye, after a while, when they're especially when
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:11.200]   they're in college. So I would put the bills on the kitchen counter, so they would realize
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:22.620]   how much it really costs to have a house. Also on moving out. Well, one thing I wanted
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:32.220]   to mention about going back to college. I learned that my kids, sad to say, but my son,
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:38.460]   he, he was, he, when he went to college, we paid for the dormitories, we paid for the
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.460]   fraternities, we paid for the sororities, we paid for wherever they lived. But when
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:49.260]   he graduated college, when he and his graduation, when they were done, he said, he sent me an
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:54.480]   email said, this stupid landlord is not returning our deposits, our security deposits. Now he
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:20:00.460]   lived in this big house with all these, you know, guys and, and sorority girls and whatever.
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:05.640]   And it was this huge house, the landlord had put together is to so that's the stupid landlord
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:10.940]   is not returning our security deposits. So I said, Well, why? He said, Well, I don't
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:15.880]   know why he said he says this, he says that. So I said, give me that. So I took the landlord's
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.700]   phone number, and I called and I asked the landlord, who was this nice guy. And I said,
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:25.900]   why, you know, why are the kids not getting their security deposits back? He said, Well,
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:31.340]   the bathrooms are full of mold there. It is mold from top to bottom, side to side. It
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:37.140]   has never been clean. My son said, Well, mom, it was mold when we moved in. And you know,
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.540]   we were studying, we didn't have time to clean. Then the landlord said to me, there was a
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:46.580]   burned out microwave in the kitchen, and it was attached somehow it was attached to the
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:51.940]   floor, I had to have workman in to take out the microwave. And my son said, Whitney, she
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.380]   burned the popcorn in the microwave. I don't know how it got on the floor. And then the
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:01.460]   landlord said there was all this mattresses, a mattress and a box spring and all this stuff
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:07.900]   in the backyard. And I had to hire a drunk remover to come remove that and to clean out
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:13.860]   the backyard. And my son's response was, Oh, that was Anthony, he got into the Naval Academy
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:19.180]   and he didn't know where to put his stuff. And I had images of Anthony, you know, piloting
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:25.180]   a Navy ship in the ocean, but he didn't know where to put his stuff. And I told my son,
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:31.740]   my son says, I'm going to sue him. And so I said, Okay, well, you know, but really,
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:38.020]   you should have taken the reins and brought that house together and said, to get our security
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:42.220]   deposits back, we have to do this, this and this. I mean, that's what you have, you should
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:48.740]   have done to get your security deposit back. Now mind you, it was my security deposit.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:55.380]   I pay my husband, I first must rent last month and security deposit. From that point on,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:01.460]   the security deposit was on the kids, no matter where they go. Even now, they're renting apartments,
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:05.320]   they're renting condos, they pay the security deposit. Well, now they're all paying their
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:12.900]   rent too. But in the beginning, you know, that's one thing you can know, they paid it,
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.140]   they don't have the like you say, the money in the game, if they don't, if they're not
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:25.700]   responsible for the money, even the best kids that you think are responsible, they don't
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:38.260]   get it. Interesting story, Miriam. Thank you so much for sharing that. Okay. Okay, investing
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:47.500]   basics. So this would be things like where to keep a taxable savings, or for that matter,
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.060]   IRAs, low cost brokerage. I know there's today there's a lot of different things like robo
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:56.340]   advisors, and I'm not really even familiar with those. Someone had mentioned a Fidelity
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.020]   youth account, which has parental oversight, and which can transition into a Fidelity brokerage
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:06.620]   account when the child turns 18. So if anybody has any experiences with any of those, we'll
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:12.220]   be happy to hear that. And then I did list the you want to teach your child these, of
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.980]   course, you want them to teach them the Bobo Heads philosophy. Live beneath your means
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.300]   develop a workable plan, never bear too much or too little risk. You know, that would be
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.540]   your asset allocation, invest early and often, like you were saying, Miriam early to get
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:32.060]   that compounding, diversify, invest with simplicity doesn't have to be complicated. Use the next
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:38.300]   funds to keep your costs down and to also track the index, minimize costs and taxes.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.740]   Never try to time the market and stay the course, which is important for right now.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:47.260]   In fact, I was calculating, we're almost I think we're down about 18% from the Heimdingen.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:51.420]   I just really wish we could just do the 20%. So it'd be a bear market, get over with and
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.500]   then we can maybe because we all know that it's it's I mean, a bear market is past due.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.260]   So just let's just get it over with. And then we can maybe start looking forward ahead.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:09.660]   But you need to just stay the course through all that. OK, we were talking about this earlier.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.900]   But for many topics, especially like investing things like difference in the stock and bond,
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:16.980]   what's the difference? I was trying to explain to my daughter the other day the difference
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.620]   between a mutual fund and ETF. And, you know, she kind of understood. But this is one of
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:27.100]   those things you have to explain multiple times before it really sinks in. Or sometimes
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:32.740]   they just won't understand until they see it actually applied to them. And they can
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:36.620]   only absorb some natural state. Mom, that's enough for today. My brain is hurting like
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:42.180]   you can only explain so much at a single sitting and then you have to let it sink in and you
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:48.940]   can do it again and then add on and on another day. They just can only absorb so much. And
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:53.620]   like like Miriam, you were saying, show them charts with compounded savings when they start
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:57.540]   young, that money that they put in when they're young is even, you know, when they're older,
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:03.780]   just gross compounds so much. I'm going to go ahead and there was a couple of questions
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:10.660]   from the RCPs. OK, so this someone asked, how are you hiring your kids and paying them
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.300]   so they can officially invest in their IRA? What is the youngest age they can do this?
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:20.860]   And has anyone done this? So what I looked up today was and someone did answer this in
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:25.220]   a chat, but I'm going to repeat it. Your child, regardless of age, can contribute to an IRA
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:31.420]   provided they have earned income. But minor children cannot establish IRAs on their own.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:36.820]   The parent has to be set up an account with the child. It is the child's money and account.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.380]   But since they're underage, the parent needs to sign the paperwork as long as they have
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:47.340]   earned income, they can contribute to an IRA. But for jobs that don't have a 1099 or a W-2,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:51.740]   it is important to keep records of the type of work, when and where it was performed and
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:58.500]   who paid the work and what amounts. And this type of job that doesn't have a 1099 or W-2
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.900]   is often the first child. Child's first job examples can include doing yard chores for
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.060]   neighbors watching kids or a family friend or helping local organization with some temporary
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.420]   work. If you're going to want to use these earnings up as a basis to make a contribution
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   to an IRA, you're going to need proof that this is really earned income. And then also
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:20.460]   you got to watch out for the tax implications. If a child or teen has earned income more
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:28.180]   than $400 in income, they must report the income on a Schedule C when filing taxes.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:32.580]   If the child doesn't get a W-2 for babysitting, which they're probably not going to, it's
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:36.660]   up to the child or the parent to keep good records or logs. In other words, if you don't
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:42.460]   have a 1099 or W-2, keep as best records as you can of either the transactions or just
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.780]   hand write a log. And then just keep in mind that you may have to file, there may be some
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:56.820]   tax implications for the child. One of the other questions is what is the positives and
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:01.460]   negatives of a custodial brokerage account? Are there any good books on the topic of teaching
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:08.700]   kids about money and investing? I do have a list of books at the end, but it was more,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.420]   it wasn't specifically too much about investing, but more about just teaching your kids like
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:16.060]   we've been talking about the basics of, you know, managing money and that kind of thing.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:24.620]   So those will be listed at the end. And somebody asked, other than 529s, the kids, UTMA brokerage
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.940]   accounts and custodial Roth IRAs, is there anything else my kids can be doing? The kids
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:34.660]   are 5th and 8th graders. I would think if they have a 529 at that age and an UTMA and
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.540]   a custodial Roth, I think they're doing great for a 5th to 8th graders. So I'm not sure
[01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:44.820]   what else, you know, you could be doing at that age. That sounds great already. Does
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:51.260]   anybody have any tips on just teaching them investing basics, helping them get set up
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:56.900]   with a, I think Miriam, you already talked about the, they had at a young age, they had
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:04.100]   a brokerage account that they started with. And, you know, sometimes they have a lesson
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:07.860]   that's kind of hard to learn if it goes down right away. That's, that's kind of a hard
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:15.980]   lesson to learn, but it's a good lesson. Yeah. They also, many of them want to, now they
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:24.060]   want to go into Robin hood. They want to buy stocks, like they want to buy Elon Musk. What
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:30.100]   is it? Tesla. They want to buy Amazon. They want to buy Bitcoin. You know, many of them,
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:36.220]   they talk about it. My kids have not really paid much attention to that. So I think that
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:45.500]   maybe after years of listening to me, hammer it into them, that mutual funds are safe.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:49.580]   They're safe. You don't have to research your stocks. You don't have to worry about stocks
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:55.220]   at night. You don't have to worry about having that awful feeling that you made a terrible
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:29:03.660]   decision and bought a company that is going to go under that mutual funds are safe. Maybe
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:10.100]   it did sink in. On the other hand, they will often come back and say, well, no, it's not
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:15.300]   going to go under, you know, Tesla will never go under. Microsoft will never go under. And
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:21.620]   then you can say, well, what about Eastman Kodak? And of course, what's that? Who's that?
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:28.300]   It's, you know, it takes a while. They'd only listen so much to their parents. They have
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:33.460]   to listen to other people. That's where the Vogelheads forum comes on that, you know,
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:37.540]   to try to introduce them to forums like that, you know, afraid to let the Vogelheads go
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:44.900]   to some other forum, financial forum and try to, you know, read that. Bill Bernstein's
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:51.740]   book, If You Can, is really, really wonderful for children, for kids, not children, I'm
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:58.140]   sorry. It's for high school, college, and it's called If You Can. It's a little tiny
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:03.380]   book like this. You can get it on Amazon with a little nest egg on front. It's really cute.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:10.420]   I bought like a lot of them, and I would give them away at work as presents to the young
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:16.300]   people who would come into work. And I would, you know, I was like an old preacher walking
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:23.220]   around with my book. But it was helpful to the young people just starting out. For my
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.380]   kids, we went to a Vogelheads conference, I had Bill Bernstein, Dr. Bernstein, sign
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   the books, autograph the books. So each of my kids has an autograph book from Bill Bernstein.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:38.280]   So I looked at what he wrote, and he wrote, kids, read this book, there will be a pop
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:44.660]   quiz. And then he wrote his name. But it's a great book. And it lays it out pretty clearly
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:52.020]   that if they don't get their act together, and invest at least something regularly get
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:58.100]   into that habit, they are going to be in deep trouble as they get older, because they will
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:06.360]   have missed out on time, and they will have missed out on compounding. There are other
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:11.820]   writers, another writer who's coming to the Vogelheads conference is Michelle Singletary.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.980]   She writes for the Washington Post, and she has a book out. I haven't read her book. But
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:28.140]   she is great. She just lays it out for kids. And for young people investing. There is a
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:35.020]   there are other Oh, I am going to say Bill Bernstein's book is free. Also, on his website,
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:39.740]   you can download it. It's a PDF in his website, I have there's a link to that at the patient
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:48.300]   frontier, I think. Yeah, right. So, um, you know, that's, that's what I do. And for presents,
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:56.140]   I give them books. I give them Jane Bryant Quinn, who has a wonderful book called making
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:02.420]   them not making, making your I don't remember the name of making the most of your money
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:11.460]   was the first one. And I Jane Bryant, Quint, Quint, Jane Bryant, Quinn, Quinn, q u i n
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:16.840]   n. And it's a thick books like this thick. It's like, yeah, it's like a it's not something
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.900]   you read from cover to cover. If you want to know about life insurance, you read that
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:25.820]   book on the sections on life insurance. She's very much a Vogelhead. And I've read about
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:33.300]   her, she's invested basically in Vanguard. And she she also like if you want to know
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:39.420]   about the difference between 401ks, whether to do a Roth 401k or a regular, you can just
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:45.380]   go to her chapter there and she will lay it out in very easy terms for people. I tried
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:51.380]   to get her to come on to speak. And I was unable to contact her directly because I believe
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:55.980]   she has retired now. But her books on the Vogelheads forum, they talk about her books
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:33:03.180]   as being very, very helpful compendium of all things investing that are easy to read
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:06.580]   as the kids start out and move into their own lives.
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:15.820]   Great, thank you so much, Miriam. Let's see what we got. Okay, a few things about taxes.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:19.820]   If your child does have a brokerage account, make sure you're aware of the kitty tax and
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.740]   they're probably not going to be earning enough for that to kick in. But just kind of read
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:27.660]   up on that real quick. And I did, there's a link to a good article on kitty tax at the
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:35.060]   bottom of this, you know, when it applies. So when your child gets even their first job
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:40.900]   at McDonald's or whatever, they're going to kind of need to know just the basics of taxes,
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:46.620]   but the gross incomes, you know, taxable income, standard deduction, tax brackets, what's the
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:53.220]   capital gain? And then how does the 401k health insurance premiums, etc, affect their W-2
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:59.260]   and their taxes? Explain, you know, there's a, you can file on paper, you can file online,
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:05.580]   make sure they know the deadline, April 15, you know, that they can do an extension if
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:09.460]   they need to. And then when it comes time to do taxes, if you live nearby, what I do
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:13.100]   is I let, you know, I have triple tax, and then I let my daughter come over and do her
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:17.540]   taxes. And I kind of sit next to her, but I kind of make her sit in a seat and like,
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:21.420]   you know, actually do the typing and enter the data, but I'm sitting next to her and
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:31.180]   kind of helping her out. So that seems to work pretty well. Does anybody have any tips
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:40.980]   on kids and taxes? Yeah. Okay. I do the same thing. I make them sit next to me to do their
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:53.940]   taxes. And my older son got it. And he actually, he still does it. My daughter, well, I still
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:59.940]   do her taxes. And sometimes she comes over and helps me. My younger son, I do his taxes
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:05.780]   with him. And he's got it, because he's a he's a techie. And so the actually he uses
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:11.340]   TurboTax. Now I never used TurboTax until recently, because I'm older, and I'm used
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:19.160]   to doing it pencil and paper and calculator. But it's a very what is useful about doing
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.500]   your own taxes is that you then understand how the tax system works. You can figure it
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:29.020]   out after all after a while you just get it. Oh, there's income and there's different kinds
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:35.260]   of income. Oh, and then there's the standard deduction. Oh, it comes off. And then there
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:44.460]   is the you subtract what I paid in, and then the rest is mine. Oh, okay. I get it income.
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:51.940]   Eventually they get the income part of it. And they realize that what is in my 401k is
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:57.540]   not there in the income. Well, where is that? Where do I pay the taxes on that? When you're
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:03.320]   retired, and you're in a lower tax bracket, so you will pay lower taxes on it. Eventually,
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.420]   that kind of sinks in, especially if they can see it. I don't know if they're visually
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:13.540]   visual, especially they can see it on a 1040 form. They can see it working.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:19.820]   Right, right. Like, yeah, that's one of those things. It just takes a while to sink in.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:26.880]   Look at the chat and see. Okay, Carol, there was one thing they asked about the books,
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.140]   and I have it here. This is the one book. I don't know if people can see it.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:35.060]   I have that book on my shelf, yeah. Yeah. Making the Most of Your Money Now.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:45.140]   Like you said, that is a thick book. Oh, yeah. By Jane Bryant Quinn. And it's like a compendium
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:52.340]   of everything. And then everything financial for families and for young people starting
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:58.740]   out. And then this is Bill Bernstein's book, Dr. Bernstein's book. I don't know if people
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:06.260]   can see it. If you can. And this is a very, very thin book, as you can see, but it is
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:17.980]   packed, packed with, it's packed. It's absolutely packed with information, very succinctly.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:24.300]   Kids, you got to get your act together, or you are going to be in big trouble when you
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:35.820]   get into retirement. Here's his signature, you know, he autographed it. So those are
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:41.060]   the books that I would recommend. Oh, there's another interesting book called The Richest
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:48.620]   Man in Babylon. I don't know if anybody's ever read that. I've heard about it for years,
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:54.460]   and I didn't read it until a couple of years ago. I loved it. I loved it. And I gave it
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:58.700]   to one of my, I gave it to my kids and someone was like, Oh, come on, this is ridiculous.
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:06.780]   And my one of my sons loved it. So if you're a kid, if your child likes it, it is lessons
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:14.300]   to financial lessons, set in ancient Babylon sounds, it sounds ridiculous, but it's not
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:21.380]   it works. You can see yourself in that you can in the stories that are presented there,
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:29.780]   you can see yourself today. And it was written, I think, in the 1930s, or the 1920s by a banker
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:34.500]   who saw that his customers didn't understand finance. And he would write out these little
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:41.660]   pamphlets and he put them on the in his bank, you put them there for people to pick up and
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:48.060]   read. It's a neat book. And also, of course, the Millionaire Next Door. Many people read
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:54.060]   that book, and they like that. Right? That's a great one. Okay, thanks, Miriam. Now I think
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:39:01.500]   this is our last slide. Other than there's resources, but yeah, okay. So we do have a
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:10.260]   slide on continuing helper gifts. And what I mean by that is, as everyone gets older,
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:15.100]   so there's two, there's two different sides to this. We'll do the positive side first.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:18.140]   So once your kids get settled in, they have a job, you know, they're responsible, you
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:24.340]   know, they're not spoiled, you know, they're good with money. Then, you know, if you're
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.180]   able and you want to, you can start maybe you might want to think about giving some
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:35.460]   special gifts to them. And this is, I like this book from Launching Financial Growness
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:40.140]   by Bobbi Rebell. What she said was, my mom and dad were able to balance making sure I
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:44.980]   knew that they would be there in a true financial emergency with making sure I never wanted
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:49.660]   to be in a position to need their emergency support. So you want to be there for your
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:55.020]   kids if they really, really need you, but you don't want them to need you. Right? And
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:59.540]   what, what I've been reading is the experts say in general, don't subsidize a higher lifestyle
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.860]   for your child on a regular basis. Don't just say, I'm going to give you $1,000 a month
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:07.540]   for your, you know, help you with your rent or whatever you want them to be able to support
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:13.340]   their own basic needs. But what I like this term that Bobbi Rebell in her Launching Financial
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:17.180]   Growness book, she coined, I don't know if she coined this term, but she used the term
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:22.460]   strategic financial boost. And what this is, is a one time limited financial boost to basically
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:27.460]   get your child, get them started, get them to the next level. For example, you know,
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.700]   they, they have this great job or they could get this great job in New York city, but you
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:36.700]   know, they, they need a little bit of help to move, to get the first apartment or whatever,
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.780]   or they just got out of college. They have no money saved. They may need a little bit
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   help, just a little bit help for a couple of months until they get the first couple
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:46.740]   of paychecks. They may want to take a training, you know, training course, help with house
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:52.340]   down payment, pay for them to stay on the family health plan until they get a job with
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.300]   health insurance or until they turn 26. But all these things are just, they're temporary.
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.580]   They have a limited time period there, or they're just one time things. And you want
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:06.860]   to kind of keep these items separate or specific for specific purposes. Like I said, the experts
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:12.060]   that I read say you don't want to supplement them on a regular basis to increase their,
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:15.780]   to a lifestyle that they can't afford on based on what they're earning. Cause you want the
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.700]   child to have pride and be able to provide in their own basic needs. There's page two
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:27.380]   to this slide. So, oops, there we go. And as I mentioned earlier, it's, to me, it's
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.820]   okay to continue to pay some small bills. That makes sense. If you have a grandfathered
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:36.420]   in their family cell phone plan, you know, that's no big deal. Here's a couple of ideas.
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:39.940]   If you do want to financially help your adult children later in life, you know, once you
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:44.900]   determine that they're financially responsible and if you're able, and if you want to, one
[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:49.020]   idea is to pay for family vacations for the whole extended family, fund grandchildren's
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:55.460]   529. And don't forget about possibly having to file IRS form 709, if your gifts succeed,
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:42:01.540]   the annual exclusion amount, which is $16,000. And one thing they mentioned on that is it
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:06.260]   is, it is capable, like one spouse can give 16, the other spouse can give 16 and you can
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:12.420]   give to the, your child spouse too, if you want to, to kind of multiply those gifts.
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:16.940]   One other idea that's been mentioned that not, of course, not everybody's going to be
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:22.820]   able to do this or want to do this, but to consider is if you're, you're set for your
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:27.140]   own retirement and you're, you know, your children could use a boost, you might, one
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:31.140]   thing you could do is disclaim and you're getting an inheritance from your parents,
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:35.420]   which is not always the case. You could consider disclaiming your own inheritance and letting
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:39.460]   it go to your children. If you do plan to do this, you want to make sure your parents'
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:44.820]   wills and IRAs and everything is set up to where it would go to your children as contingent
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.380]   beneficiaries if you disclaim them. Hopefully by this time, your children will be older
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:53.540]   and able to handle receiving the inheritance. And like I said, you may be already retired.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:58.700]   You're already set. You don't need the extra money. Whereas your child may be just in the
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:02.340]   phase of life where they could definitely use that extra boost. Not that they need it,
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.100]   but they could use it to maybe get a little bit bigger house, maybe some remodeling, pay
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.500]   for their child's college. Maybe, maybe both parents don't have to work so hard and maybe
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.700]   have young kids at home. One of them could stay home, that kind of thing. So just something
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:18.620]   to consider and also watch out for, there's something called the generation skipping tax
[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:26.100]   might come into play if you do the, do this strategy. Okay. There was, there was one question
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:31.660]   on the RSVP about this and it's, what are options for leaving inheritance now that the
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:39.300]   stretch IRA has been eliminated? And if you're not aware of what the stretch IRA was, it's
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:45.060]   if you left your, for example, your, your child in IRA, they used to be able to stretch
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:50.420]   it out. And I don't know the exact rules, but they basically over their own life expectancy
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:56.460]   and a few years back, they changed it where they have to take it out over 10 years. And
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:03.620]   this could be a big problem. If you leave a large taxable IRA to a, anybody or a child
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:08.620]   or anybody else, and they're working, they're already in a pretty high tax bracket. And
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.500]   they say you have a million, you know, $2 million IRA, they're going to have to take
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:17.740]   out. Now they could wait until the end of the 10 years. And well, there's other rules
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.980]   about RMDs, but I'm not going to get into that, but say they, they spread it out $200,000
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:27.380]   a year, $100,000 a year, that's going to put them in a real, could potentially put them
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:34.540]   in a much higher tax bracket. The only suggestion I have for that is to pop, you know, convert
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:40.100]   as much as you can to a Roth, because if it's in a Roth, then they still have to take out
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.100]   the money, but they don't have to pay tax on it. So I don't know if anybody else has
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:47.820]   any other ideas on what to do about the, they call it the death of the stretch IRA. Does
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:55.420]   anybody have any tips on that? I know Jim, I listen to a podcast, his name is Jim Lang.
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:45:01.300]   He has a lot of podcasts and articles on, they were actually anticipating the death
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:06.460]   of the stretch IRA for about five years before it happened. So they, they have a lot of podcasts
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:17.660]   and articles and things on that. So that's about all. Okay. And then we have like I said,
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:23.380]   we have a whole page of resources. There's a lot of there's a few, sorry, vocal heads
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:33.020]   discussion that I kind of bookmarked. There's articles from Clark Howard about credit cards,
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:40.300]   credit cards for kids, that kind of thing. What else do we have? Some articles I found
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:49.260]   seven ways to raise money savvy kids. There's JL Collins website on there. Oh, the last
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:56.340]   link is all about the kitty tax and when it applies, then there's books and most of which
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:59.860]   I have kind of skimmed through to prepare for this. Some of which I got from the library,
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:05.260]   some of which I actually purchased this, that's launching financial grownups by Bobby Rabel
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:13.260]   and it is really good, really good book. And then the last page is podcasts that are interest
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:31.900]   of interest about having to do with this discussion about teaching finance to children.
