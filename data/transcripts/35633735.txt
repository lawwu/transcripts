[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time with you today as we encourage
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.760]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.300]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.640]   Whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the daily delight
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.700]   of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.220]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.560]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.720]   So, go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.040]   Well, listeners, it is Faces of History time.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.960]   Can you believe it?
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.480]   I can't believe that our Classical Conversations community year is that close to the end for
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.580]   another school year.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.600]   But I know that most of you who have Essentials students are winding down the year and have
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.260]   probably already begun to talk about the Faces of History project with your Essentials students.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.480]   And so, I figured you might have some questions or be looking for some fresh ideas if you've
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.720]   done this for a few years.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.260]   So, I have gathered some great friends to give you a little fresh perspective.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.800]   I have with me today, Courtney Bradshaw.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.200]   Courtney is the AA, the Academic Advisor for Scribblers, Foundations, and Essentials.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   Courtney, thanks for coming.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.340]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.700]   And I have Kelly Wilt, who is the Curriculum Developer for Foundations.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.140]   Kelly, it's always great to have you along.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.620]   Absolutely, Lisa.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.880]   Thanks for inviting me.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.020]   And I have Sarah Pedersen, who serves as an editor with Classical Conversations Multimedia.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.180]   And Sarah, I happen to know, has a special spot in her heart for Essentials.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.760]   Sarah, thanks for coming.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.420]   Very glad to be here.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.260]   These ladies have a wealth of wide experience with Faces of History and with Essentials.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.140]   So, I feel like they are going to be able to give us some enthusiasm and some great ideas.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.880]   But, Courtney, I want you to start us off because we may have some listeners whose children have not yet gotten to Essentials.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.900]   Or maybe this is their very first year in Essentials.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:05.460]   So, Courtney, I'm going to get you to give us the simplest definition for the Faces of History project.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.140]   The who, the what, the when, the where, and the how.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.760]   Okay, so Faces of History is the capstone event for Essentials students.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.320]   They write a five-paragraph essay about a famous person.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:32.380]   And if desired, they present their research in costume around, yes, around week 21 with the rest of their community.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.540]   It might be during their Essentials community time or at another time that is set aside by their director and tutor.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.140]   Oh, that is a great thumbnail of that.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.240]   I really appreciate it.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.340]   Okay, a five-paragraph essay, that seems a little daunting, except why is it not daunting, Courtney?
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.380]   It's not daunting because they've spent the entire year learning how to do it.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.840]   And really, a five-paragraph essay includes three topics and then an introduction and a conclusion,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:16.700]   which are not, you know, super difficult for this age group because they've practiced it for so many weeks.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.480]   Yeah, so they've been practicing it.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.040]   And they get to choose their topic.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.500]   And we'll talk about that in just a minute.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.640]   And so because it's something that they pick and they're interested in, they have an easier time writing about that.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.160]   I love it.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.420]   I love what you said.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.840]   And I want us to explore that in a minute, too.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.880]   The whole idea about costumes.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.560]   I think my girls, when they were little, dress-up was like our number one thing.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.380]   We loved it.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.100]   We had a huge dress-up box.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.660]   In fact, I still have a huge dress-up box at my house.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.400]   And so that sounds really fun.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.820]   Sarah, I want to ask you, because I know that you have loved Essentials for a long time.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.280]   Now, have you loved it as a parent or as a tutor or both?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.800]   I have loved it as both a tutor and a parent for sure.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.680]   I think one of my favorite things about this project is the enthusiasm and the excitement that kids show.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:25.260]   Sometimes they get even a preview in their foundations years if foundation students are invited to see faces of his presentations.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.660]   And so they've got in the back of their mind this really fun thing that's coming up once they get to Essentials.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.380]   So there's just this excitement, this culmination of this really fun thing you get to do at the end of your Essentials year.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.240]   I think that's cool.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.860]   I think it's really neat that kids get excited about a project.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.820]   And I can imagine them getting excited about dressing up.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:58.380]   And I can imagine them getting excited to have a presentation to do, maybe like older brothers and sisters do, and having something to work on.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.320]   Kelly, what do you think students gain from participating in Faces of History?
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.120]   Oh, Lisa, that's such a great question.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.220]   What do they gain?
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.120]   I think they gain several things.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:21.900]   One thing I think they gain is a little bit of experience taking those speaking skills that they've sharpened and refined through their foundations presentations on a weekly basis.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:32.300]   They get the opportunity to practice those in a different environment with a different topic, which they have chosen, hopefully because they love it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.240]   And so there is an enthusiasm there because they're sharing what they have learned with others.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:47.520]   I think another thing that they gain from their participation in Faces of History is the understanding that good things take time.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.300]   Oh, that's really good.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.720]   Yeah, and energy and hard work.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:14.880]   And so, you know, I think Courtney has already alluded to this, but, you know, being successful at Faces of History is the culmination of lots of little choices and conversations that you have together as a family leading up to that main event where your student gets to sign and costume and share everything that they've researched and that they've learned.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.980]   So I think those are just a couple of things that students gain.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.480]   I think parents also can gain some perspective.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:38.520]   Of history, looking at your student, having conversations with your student, being able to assess what are the things that come easily or the things that might need a little bit more collaborative work with you and your student.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:48.300]   So it gives you an idea of how your student is doing in preparation for challenge and for possibly some of those projects that may be later to come as well.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.500]   That's really good.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:08:02.080]   I had not really thought about the fact that this is one of the first times that our students work on a project that has a long run.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.200]   You know, you start talking about what do you want to be?
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.420]   Who do you want to be?
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.960]   Who do you want to write about?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.720]   And you start doing the research.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.260]   And it has a long, it's a longer run up to things than most of our kids.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:24.200]   You know, they've done presentations before, but usually they plan just a few days in advance, not several weeks in advance.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.820]   So that's a really good, that's a really good point that you made, Kelly.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.980]   All right.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.360]   All of you guys have talked about how much fun it is.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:43.000]   And I want you to share some stories about the fun that you've had maybe with your own children doing Faces of History.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.360]   But I have to say this, for some kids, it's not as much fun.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.060]   What about kids, because we've had them in our community.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:08.700]   What about kids who really don't like to pretend or kids who are a little shy, who don't like to be the center of attention, who don't really want to be on stage, maybe who don't want to dress up?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.640]   Courtney, what do you do for those kids?
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.240]   Do they have to do all that stuff?
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.420]   They don't.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.280]   It's optional.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.360]   But yes, Faces of History is not mandatory for any student to do.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:43.380]   But it's really, when it's treated like a celebration, what they have learned, students of all abilities and those who like to be in front of people and those who don't find their place, you know, they can decide to dress up or not.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.480]   Or to be extra in their dressing up or minimalist.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.180]   You have a minimalist mom like me.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.320]   You know what?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   Sometimes that's where you are in life.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.140]   Yes.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:07.000]   And the presentation can be more minimal for students who are nervous to be in front of people.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.660]   There is no requirement that they have to have a long presentation.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:18.880]   Actually, we don't mind it when it's a little bit short because there are a lot of students to get through.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.780]   There's a lot of kids.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.080]   Yes.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.260]   And they may have just a few facts to share instead of an entire essay.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:33.060]   It seems to me that the emphasis is on growing in the skill.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.780]   There's not a certain, we're not comparing students to one another.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.160]   And I would encourage parents not even to compare the children in your own home.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.320]   All your children are differently natured and different with different abilities.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.260]   I had one who loved to be on stage that thought everybody was lucky that they got to see her.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.220]   And then one who really did not want to be the center of attention.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.340]   And so kids are differently natured.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.020]   Sarah, what do you think about that?
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:10.940]   Has your experience been that most students really do have a good time with this?
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.320]   Absolutely.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:19.340]   And I have absolutely experienced students that are nervous and not sure going in if this
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.640]   is something they want to do.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.700]   I know as a tutor, I really try to encourage parents just kind of to reinforce what Courtney
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.880]   mentioned is that this project is completely scalable.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:39.800]   And so the parent really is in the driver's seat as far as what the scope of their child's
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.200]   assignment is going to be.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:48.080]   If that means that they're only going to present on one topic, a few facts rather than two topics,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.860]   that is completely fine.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.180]   really practicing the skill, practicing the process and what that looks like.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:03.320]   And knowing, having the child experience just the satisfaction of knowing that they can do this,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.360]   they can get through it.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.020]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.360]   And the beauty of essentials is that it's meant to be repeated, right?
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.280]   So hopefully, because it's a celebration next year, they'll be ready to celebrate again with
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.700]   even a little bit more confidence.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.900]   And they'll know what to expect.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.280]   That's really good.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   I'm so glad you brought that up, Sarah, that what we want to do is encourage children to do
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.860]   their best and to try and maybe to stretch a little bit so that they prove to themselves that
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.220]   they can do hard things.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.620]   That's that is lovely.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.880]   All right, Kelly, I know that you are the mistress of fun things.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:46.660]   And so how have you helped your children or children in the communities that you've served?
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.960]   How have you helped them enjoy Faces of History?
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:58.460]   Oh, I think that Courtney hit the nail on the head by approaching Faces of History as a celebration
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:04.860]   of all that they have learned and celebrating with them not only the fun dress up aspect,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:10.320]   but the things that they have gleaned over the course of the year in essentials.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.220]   And, you know, as a tutor, I remember reading some of the students' Faces of History papers,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:21.900]   or they would read them even aloud in community, and finding those things to celebrate with them.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.920]   Like, oh, I really loved this sentence opener that you used.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.880]   Or, oh, listen to that, those L-Y adverbs, way to go.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:36.680]   You know, celebrating those little things that they've gleaned helps them to be so proud of all that they've accomplished.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.620]   And I think it just adds to the nature of the event.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.300]   Because like Courtney said, you know, some communities choose, and families choose to be a little more minimalist.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:53.540]   There are other families who, you know, look at this as, wow, this is a celebration and we're going to go all out.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:00.120]   So one of the delightful things about Faces of History is that you get to celebrate it in the way that your family sees best.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.140]   And I think that aspect of this makes it wonderful for everyone.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.460]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.700]   And that's what makes the community special.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.360]   Everybody gets a taste of all different flavors of Faces of History.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.680]   All right, Courtney, break the project down for us.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.280]   What do families do first?
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.480]   And then what are the next steps?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:26.660]   And give me an idea, how long should it take each part?
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.600]   How long should it take our family to complete each part of our preparation?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:38.740]   Well, I think the first thing any parent should do is to go to the Essentials Learning Center.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.180]   Oh, this is so good.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.280]   Okay, tell me about it.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.320]   In week seven, they will find the Faces of History parent packet.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   And it will give them a step-by-step process on what to do and when.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.780]   Okay, say that again.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.560]   Because you know what?
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.900]   Some parents are just like, whoop, somebody just stumbled over the curb while they were jogging
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.860]   because you said where to find that.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:09.280]   Okay, so it's in CC Connected in the Learning Center, week seven, and it's called Faces of History Parent Packet?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.080]   Yes.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.780]   Okay, you heard it, guys.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.980]   Write it down.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.900]   That will be the first thing.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.500]   And then what families do together is talk with their student about picking a character.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:33.240]   Right now, if you're in cycle one, that's a great place to begin, looking for who they may want to learn more about.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.700]   So picking a character can take a long time for some students.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.880]   And that's why it's suggested that that process began early.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.680]   Yes.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.900]   And then after you pick a character, you start looking for sources.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:55.120]   It's suggested that the sources be at or below reading level for students.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.400]   Okay.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.380]   Why is that?
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.860]   Because it makes it, they're summarizing a reference.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:13.200]   And if you have a source that is difficult for a child to read, they're going to find it difficult to pick out facts that they enjoy or they think are important.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.640]   So you're not asking them to do two hard things at once, decode big words and recognize important information.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.220]   Good.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:22.960]   I like that.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.700]   Yes.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:34.980]   And then they will start making summarized outlines from their three sources about three topics that they have chosen.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:46.160]   And really that depends on what the parent decides that a student needs to do, how much they need to read sources first.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:57.900]   So in my home, I only have the expectation that my children will fully read one of their three sources and then skim for the topics.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:58.480]   Yep.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.500]   Because I think that is a skill to learn as well.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.400]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:12.880]   And so it just, it depends on what the parent is requiring of a child and how long it takes to read that source for them.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:21.140]   But really they have already in essentials been writing a five paragraph essay from unit seven.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.980]   And that entire process was able to be done in two to three weeks.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:32.780]   So the basis of history should not really take much longer than that.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:46.580]   And I think the summarizing the sources will probably take the longest for the students and then writing their outlines work together with that.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:53.820]   A younger student, depending on, really, it depends on the sources that you have.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.300]   Right.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.380]   As long as it will take.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:01.940]   But it's suggested that this can be done in a week to two weeks, just five new sources.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.020]   And then they will write their paragraphs.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.980]   And again, that can take a week to two weeks.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.960]   So it shouldn't really take them more than two to four weeks to complete the entire project.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.020]   That's cool.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.940]   That's really cool.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:27.480]   And because they have been doing these kinds of tasks all year long, it's just more of the same.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:34.080]   We're just putting it together maybe a little more flamboyantly for some of those ones.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.720]   So, Sarah, what do you think?
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.080]   What's been your experience?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.960]   What's the hardest part for most of the essential students?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:53.140]   I would say for many of our essential students, even though they have been practicing these skills on a smaller scale throughout the year,
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:59.860]   this is often the largest assignment that they have ever, the largest writing assignment that they've ever tackled.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   And thinking about an oral presentation, there can certainly be nerves involved with that, especially if the parent is feeling a bit overwhelmed.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.580]   I think sometimes we can accidentally give our kids some of those vibes.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   So I really, I have a tip to alleviate stress.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.800]   Oh, perfect.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:33.660]   In addition to reading the parent packet that Courtney has mentioned, I would strongly recommend selecting source texts that are age appropriate for kids.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:40.100]   And by age appropriate, I actually mean either at or below reading level.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.880]   Because sometimes we're worried we're not going to have enough information about a character.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   And we really don't need as much as perhaps we think we do.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:20:02.740]   Just a couple of solid paragraphs that are easy for the student to read can make the assignment feel much more manageable as opposed to weeding through a really thick book that you've gotten from the library.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.740]   That may be more appropriate.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.100]   That's really over your head.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.420]   So making it manageable.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:16.140]   And, you know, it sounds cliche, but really trying to relax and have fun with it and really enjoy the process.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:22.920]   Keeping things simple and not trying to do too much, not trying to get through too much material.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.140]   That is such a great insight.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:43.020]   You know, I'm looking back and I'm looking back at my overachiever self in the early years of Essentials with my girls and realizing as you're talking that, oh, I probably stamped out a little bit of the joy by trying to pull too many resources for my girls.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:52.820]   In my zeal to give them all the available information, it probably drowned out some of their joy.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:04.760]   So that is a really good insight, parents, to carefully select just a couple of resources and preserve the joy in the process.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.660]   That's really good.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:18.440]   Kelly, I know, I've heard Courtney say before that, oh, the most pressing question she gets about faces of history is, can't you give me a list of characters?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.760]   And so I know, I know that we do not provide lists of characters.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.400]   Why do we not do that?
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.720]   Oh, because we don't, we don't want to limit you.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.940]   Yes.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:39.340]   Types of things that you choose and, and to limit what your child may be interested in.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:53.660]   Yes, it is good to look at lists of characters and to be inspired, but there may be one person on the timeline that as you sing the timeline song and foundations, your child is drawn to that individual.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.440]   Harness that enthusiasm and let your child explore that person.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   Because in the past, you know, I have seen children beautifully dressed up as the Great Pyramid.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.980]   Oh my word, what a great idea.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.380]   Or, you know, different, different things.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:23.680]   So looking for a list of people might be inspirational, but don't allow it to limit what your child is interested in.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:32.520]   Because this really is an interest-based, a passion-driven project for your young writer to complete with you.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:42.100]   So, you know, I just think it's wonderful to, and I believe Courtney's already alluded to this, or it may have been Sarah, having those conversations.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:23:00.080]   Families, after you download that Faces of History Packet, just take your child through the drive-thru for a milkshake and sit down together and have a conversation about, all right, you know, in the history sentences that you've sung this year, is there a person that you're really interested in?
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.260]   Or, you know, is there a place or an event that you would like to learn more about?
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.360]   And just jot down all of those ideas and revisit them later.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:21.720]   Because you just never know what might be that one thing that, you know, that one itch in the brain that your child has, that you can explore together.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.080]   That's good.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.140]   I know that for some kids, you're right, it is a daunting task.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.120]   Courtney said it well, that sometimes that takes the longest picking the character.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:43.960]   And sometimes it's because our little kids, they think the year seems just like an interminably long time to them.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:53.080]   And they have all these people swirling through their brains from the history sentences and the timeline cards and all of these people.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.240]   And they can't remember what they liked from week to week.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:03.080]   So, moms, it might be good just to sit down and talk about, say the names, read out the names.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.880]   And notice, is there a name that makes them giggle?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.180]   Is there a funny sounding name?
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:15.280]   Or is there a picture that they loved that went along with one of the timeline cards?
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:38.140]   Courtney, who are some of the people that you have seen students research and really enjoy being, either in your own family or just in your community?
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.020]   Because I know you've been a foundations director for a number of years.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.140]   Well, I've seen a lot of Bible characters.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.900]   Okay.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.760]   See, now I wasn't even thinking about that.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.540]   Good deal.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.020]   We have several in our community this year, the Bible characters.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:02.660]   There have been gladiators and warriors and leaders that I had never heard of.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.620]   Oh, my word.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.320]   Yes.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.980]   It happens a lot with the girls.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.140]   Okay.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.100]   They find people that I have never heard of.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.140]   Where did they find these people?
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:24.160]   Well, they start looking and they dig into really the places that we are memorizing.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.960]   And so then they start to look up and they say, oh, I really liked that place.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.980]   Or I want to know more about that picture.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:37.640]   And so they find people who have done really cool things.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.440]   In those places or at that time.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.460]   What a great idea.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:41.760]   Okay.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.320]   That's good.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.200]   That's really good.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.380]   I had one year we had a student who was the Mona Lisa.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.140]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.780]   That's funny.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.440]   That was it was really funny.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.140]   She had this blow up costume and her face was Mona Lisa.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.340]   Amazing.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.140]   She's a theater kid.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.380]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.360]   I can see it.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.340]   And then I even had one year.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.780]   And this this speaks back to what we discussed before about students who are very nervous.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:23.840]   I had been a foundations tutor for a girl who in her very first year, she whispered her presentations to her mom.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   And then her mom would give us, you know, would present for her.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:40.180]   And then in her last year of essentials, she dressed up as Queen Victoria and gave a memorized presentation in a British accent.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.840]   Oh, my word.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.100]   It was beautiful.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.720]   That's growth.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.660]   That's really cool to see students make those kinds of strides.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.540]   I love that.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.420]   That's awesome.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:00.520]   So, you guys, I want you all to throw in how elaborate do the costumes get?
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.720]   I know that I know some people don't dress up at all.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:11.880]   And some, you know, sometimes you are in a stage of life where you just think, OK, nothing extra can happen here now.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:19.480]   But then some people get really creative or some kids just really go all out and making up their costumes.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.440]   How elaborate do they get?
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:37.080]   Well, the student that was Queen Victoria, her mother was a seamstress.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.420]   And so she made a Victorian dress with the hoop skirts and everything.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.980]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.920]   For her.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.620]   Yes.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.540]   It was very elaborate and beautiful.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:28:05.780]   And my children that year, just so there's perspective, my children chose their characters based on the costumes they could find after the ones that went on sale.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.520]   Yes.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.940]   In October or in November.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.340]   Yes, yes.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.820]   And that's who they chose because we could find a very inexpensive costume that they liked.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.920]   That's good.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.100]   And, say, that is a criteria that can be used.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.660]   Sarah, what about you?
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.160]   Have you guys seen some elaborate costumes in your communities?
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.800]   We have.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.320]   We've definitely seen elaborate ones.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.540]   But I would say for the most part, they've been pretty simple.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:47.060]   I think it's amazing what can be done with a bed sheet and a belt from your parents' closet, going to the thrift store, you know, finding shoes that could sort of suit a certain time period.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.320]   So it doesn't have to be elaborate.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:57.060]   It also doesn't have to be head to toe, depending on what the child prefers and what their personality is.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:05.060]   But definitely something that can spark the imagination and portray the character or the topic that they're presenting.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.760]   I would say for the most part, our communities have leaned more on the simple side.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.580]   Some of the more memorable ones I'm thinking of have been homemade.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:22.920]   I'm thinking of astronauts and other characters that were portrayed with big cardboard helmets or swords or different pieces.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.980]   So that's been a lot of fun.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.320]   Yeah, yeah, I remember.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:34.960]   I think Faces of History is what gave my girls the love of the thrift store for costumes and stuff.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.600]   And I like what you said, Sarah, that it doesn't have to be a head to toe costume.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:50.900]   It could be like a signature piece, like a certain style of hat or a cape or, you know, a pipe or a pair of boots.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.860]   That's really good.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.800]   Kelly, what kind of costumes have you seen people wear?
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.820]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.900]   I'm trying to think of the most elaborate one.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.560]   I think it's the most outlandish.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.320]   I have to say, I have witnessed Cleopatra being brought in on a chaise.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.880]   Oh, my word.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.040]   That requires some cooperation there.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:08.840]   Yes.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:08.920]   Yes.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.560]   Yes.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.600]   Yes.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   Yes.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   And I also agree with Sarah.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:21.920]   You know, we have been part of communities that for the most part kept it simple and tried to really focus on the overall experience.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.820]   But it is a lot of fun to help your child to think outside the box.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:34.200]   And I know that our family, our family has participated in Faces of History, I think, nine times altogether between each of our three.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.520]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.220]   Yes.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.320]   And so there have been various times where we've had more time than money.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.640]   Or vice versa.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.680]   We've had to curtail or, you know, invent.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:55.260]   And so I agree with you, Lisa, about the love of the thrift store because I have produced Civil War uniforms out of repurposed ladies' blazers.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:04.400]   I have fabric glued insignia, military insignias onto shirts to create a uniform for Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:12.380]   And I have repurposed a sheet for etogas of various sorts more times than I could probably care to tell.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.800]   So I think it's entirely up to your family.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.580]   And I would really encourage you.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.340]   I know the Faces of History packet has some suggestions in it.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.340]   Just to look online for – don't be intimidated by ideas online.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.160]   Be inspired.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:37.060]   Pretty much anything that you see that is a costume, you can find some way to be able to put that costume together for less.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:47.200]   By visiting the thrift store or, like I said, a fabric store quite often has shiny buttons or, you know, patches of sorts.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.760]   And be inspired to do what you can do.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:58.900]   And I would say allow your child to be involved in it because then they have ownership in the most delightful way.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:06.080]   I remember our daughter wanted desperately to be Medusa for one piece of history.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.840]   And her dance teacher at that time had surprised her because she heard her talking about Medusa.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:19.660]   And, of course, we were concocting in our minds all sorts of hairstyles contrived with metal hangers.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:26.820]   And she actually found a hat for her that was stuffed snakes and presented it to her.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.680]   And so she was overjoyed.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:43.420]   So also mention to the people in your life what you may be doing because you might be able to borrow some things as well from another family that's participated in Faces of History previously or just chosen to dress up for different events.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.540]   So you never know.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.740]   There's a whole treasure chest if you just mention what you're looking for.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.020]   The likelihood is we're homeschool parents.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.740]   Someone might have it.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.140]   That's right.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:54.840]   That's right.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.060]   Somebody has either has it or has made something like it before.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.060]   That's really good.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:08.540]   You guys mentioned various ways that students can present their character or become their character.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:16.980]   Some people do it, I guess, during the essentials time and community, maybe during those last weeks.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:26.680]   And then some people have, I understand, sometimes there are like special assemblies or special presentation nights.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.160]   What has been your experience, Sarah?
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:41.100]   Well, as Courtney laid out for us, there are three set-aside weeks during community for students to work on Faces of History.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:58.420]   And then in the communities I have been part of, it's been really a decision, hopefully at the beginning of the year, between the essentials tutor and the foundation's director as to the best time to actually have them present their oral presentations.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:05.340]   So that can be, I know in some communities, it can be right after the papers are done on week 21.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:13.620]   The communities I have been part of have usually chosen to have that celebration be right on week 24.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.380]   And so it's a bit of a logistical thing.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.260]   You know, students in our communities have finished their Faces of History papers.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:29.220]   We've gone on in community to hit Unit 9 because there is one more unit after the Faces of History project.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:38.700]   And then we've come together on week 24 as a celebration during the normal essentials time to have students present their papers.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:45.660]   I have also been part of communities where there's been a separate evening that was selected as well.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:51.000]   And that also can work well so that dads and grandparents and other friends can join.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.940]   So I've seen it done a few different ways.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:58.600]   Courtney, Kelly, do you guys have anything to add to that when people present?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:06.320]   I've seen communities that have done a wax museum.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.460]   That's a cool idea.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:19.040]   Yes, and they've done it during lunch so that you can invite your community to stop by and foundation students.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:31.000]   And everyone can see that and then have either in the afternoon of the wax museum or come back in the evening have presented their their speeches after that.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.220]   So usually it will be either in community day or, you know, following.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:51.600]   I've seen people do an elaborate dinner, like a maybe not even an elaborate dinner, but a dinner themed time so that people could just bring in food and and feast together.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.660]   Well, it's great.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:36:00.960]   But I agree with Sarah that usually you will find it either somewhere between weeks 21 and 24.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.440]   It just sounds like a great celebration.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.860]   Kelly, what do you think?
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:24.300]   Yeah, I would just add to what Courtney and Sarah have already shared that as a parent, if you're listening to this and you're an essentials parent and you just have a vision for what the Faces of History event can be, definitely have a conversation with your child's tutor and also with your director.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:37.060]   Because, you know, sometimes as tutors, it is lovely to have parents come alongside you and say, you know, I know you're really focused on encouraging the children and community, and I would love to help with the heavy lifting for something like this.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:43.980]   And I'm going to tell you that that tutor will shine like the sun at hearing those words.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:59.780]   So definitely, if this is something that as a parent, you're looking for ways to become involved in your community, helping with Faces of History and helping to orchestrate that event is a great way for you to be involved and to support your child and your child's tutor in essentials.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:06.500]   Man, essentials tutors and foundations directors everywhere are rising up to call you blessed right now, Kelly.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.020]   That's a good thing.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.940]   All right.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:15.140]   As we as we draw this episode to a close, I really would love to pick your brains one last time.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:38.120]   So I'm going to let each of you tell what you have learned from the Faces of History project and process, either with your own children or in communities that you have served, and then conclude with your best tip for us going through Faces of History this year.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   All right.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.560]   Courtney, I'm going to let you go first.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.960]   Okay, so I have learned just how versatile the essay model is.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:38:04.180]   We have used it throughout our challenge years in research strand and in other places and are currently using and we're expanding the essay right now for my daughter in challenge four as she writes her senior thesis.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.840]   Oh, that's so great.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:15.280]   This is a great beginning that will just be built upon as they grow in their academic years.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:22.800]   And then my best tip is keep it simple and help them as much as they need help.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.740]   They are nine to 11 year olds.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:32.580]   And so it is a big deal for them to do this.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.900]   And we don't have to add pressure, you know, to make it bigger than it needs to be.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.840]   So keep it simple and have fun.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.920]   Good.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.460]   Good.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.200]   All right, Sarah.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.480]   Well, Courtney reflected a lot of my thoughts.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.460]   So I would be in full agreement with that.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.340]   I think definitely the concept that students can do hard things.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:52.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.360]   That's something I've learned.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.020]   I already knew that they could do hard things.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:03.380]   But it's been such a blessing, both as a tutor and as a parent with my own kids, to see what students are able to accomplish.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:15.360]   And some of the most memorable years for us, as we've shared before, are some of the years for my own kids where they really connected well with their character and really got enthusiastic about it.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.040]   So I would also emphasize what Courtney said about relaxing and enjoying and really enjoying the ride.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:29.080]   I've got one particularly an introverted daughter who was Emily Dickinson one year.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.520]   She very much resonated with Emily's personality.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:40.040]   And looking back now as a challenge student, it's one of her best memories of CC.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.920]   So I think essential students are at a very special time.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:54.960]   And for one thing, looking back, you've got foundation students that are looking ahead to essential students thinking, wow, that looks like so much fun.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.540]   I can't wait.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:04.400]   But then in our community, we've also got challenge students looking back with wonderful memories of the times that they were in, faces of history.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:17.240]   And so taking a step back, I would just like to echo what has already been said, and that is try not to stress, try to enjoy the ride, because these are really wonderful memories that are being made.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.080]   That's great encouragement.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.860]   Okay, Kelly, bring us to a full stop.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.900]   There's so much wisdom that both of these ladies have shared.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:36.160]   I think I would add to this, to be mindful that we are in the process of acquiring skills as we work through the Faces of History Project.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:48.220]   And to be mindful as parents that, as Courtney's already alluded to, these are skills that are going to continue to be sharpened and refined as your child moves into challenge.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:58.840]   So don't see this as an end point, see it as a comma and, because your child is going to continue to grow through this experience.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.460]   And the delightful thing about Faces of History is that it's repeated more than once.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:18.140]   And so you as a parent will be able to measure your child's growth in these skills as they complete this project, not once, hopefully, but twice or even three times before moving into challenge.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.720]   And I think my number one tip is involve your child.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:30.320]   As a parent, sometimes we can feel pressure to do things for them, because we think it will lend a better result.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   And the truth is, sometimes when we do that, we stunt their growth.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:41.640]   So involve them in each aspect, help them, you know, have a conversation where they are choosing their character.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:47.760]   Like Sarah said, when they're invested, they truly do begin those first steps of ownership.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.800]   That we're trying to cultivate in Challenge A.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:42:06.000]   And, you know, as you're disciplining yourself to move through the different steps of this project, you're going to already help your child to begin to have those first tastes of freedom as they stand and they present what they've worked so hard to cultivate.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:14.600]   So, parents, even though this is an essentials project, it truly is your child's first taste of the types of things they will be doing in Challenge.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.540]   And enjoy those moments.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:30.100]   Take lots of photos, because they will be the things that, as your child is potentially in Challenge for, they will be the photos that will go on a senior memory board or that may go in a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:42.820]   And try to remember, because as a homeschooling mom who's nearing the end of her family's homeschooling journey, I look back on all those photos and the videos and I treasure those memories.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:52.860]   They are a part of a family's journey that is worthy to be celebrated over and over again as memoria of the blessings of God in your family through Classical Conversations.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.540]   That's so many good reminders.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:00.160]   You guys have been a blessing to our listeners today.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.480]   Thank you, Courtney and Sarah and Kelly, so very much.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.340]   I appreciate you guys for sharing your wisdom and your experiences with us.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:15.960]   Listeners, I want you to have a wonderful time with Faces of History with your children.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:24.840]   And as you are looking toward the end of the year, don't forget that we have opportunities for you as parents to continue learning.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:33.160]   You can join other homeschool parents in your area at a 2025 Parent Practicum.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.320]   They are hosted by CC Leaders every summer.
