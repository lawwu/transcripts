[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What do you think are the three to five things
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.660]   that basically everybody, if they can,
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.360]   should know about what's circulating in their blood?
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.100]   I'm imagining LDL, HDL, this kind of thing.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.060]   I guess ApoB is a big favorite of our friend Peter Attia.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.580]   Fasting blood glucose, continuous blood glucose,
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700]   post-meal, et cetera, just kind of evaluating
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.420]   how exercise, food, et cetera, impacts blood glucose.
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.220]   And then I'll leave the other categories open
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.540]   'cause my point here is not to answer the question.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.380]   That's what comes to mind.
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.140]   - You've got the big ones.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.140]   So this is key is that every single person listening,
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.660]   I hope after this episode will go to their health record
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.520]   or send their doctor a message
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.140]   and at least get the following test.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.140]   And the first seven that I'll mention are very basic
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.500]   and people might take umbrage to them
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.740]   because obviously there's a lot of debate about
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.540]   what's everyone's favorite lab test.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.940]   But I think about it as what are the basics
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.020]   that everyone should know
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.060]   and then what's the next tier up
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.780]   that are easy to access and are cheap
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780]   that'll give you a lot more richness,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140]   which you still might have to kind of fight your doctor for.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.940]   So the first few that you will not have to fight
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.220]   your doctor for and are often free on an annual physical
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.700]   and literally define metabolic syndrome
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.860]   are fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides,
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.780]   HDL cholesterol, hemoglobin A1C, total cholesterol,
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.040]   waist circumference and blood pressure.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.100]   - Okay, sorry, I hate to interrupt
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.500]   and my audience hates it even more,
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.340]   but I'm gonna just,
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.900]   could you just explain what each of those is
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.020]   and what it corresponds to?
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.860]   - Yes. - Great, thank you.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.020]   - And I will say, first of all,
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.340]   the reason I'm choosing these,
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.220]   it's not even my own choice really, it's two reasons.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.580]   One is that the two studies over the past five years
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.580]   that have shown us in large populations
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580]   that the vast majority of American adults
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.100]   are metabolically dysfunctional use those biomarkers.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.420]   So I think because of that, it's important to know them.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.820]   And the two studies that I'm referring to
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.300]   are one from UNC in 2018,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.460]   which showed that based on those biomarkers,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.620]   88% of American adults have suboptimal metabolism.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.860]   And then a follow-up study
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.140]   from the Journal of the American College of Cardiology
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.300]   from last year showed that that number has gone to 93.2%
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.460]   of American adults are suboptimal in their metabolism.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.900]   And these are the metrics that they use
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.940]   and they're very basic.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.180]   If you had to pay out of pocket,
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.780]   they would be less than $100.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.900]   So let's talk through them.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.720]   Why they're great is because together,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.060]   they give you kind of like a tapestry
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.660]   of what's actually happening inside the cell.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.860]   If you choose to look at them that way,
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.900]   if you read the tea leaves of them,
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.540]   the doctors often, if they see all these lab tests,
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.980]   it'll be in an electronic health record.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.000]   We've all been through this experience.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.140]   They'll come up on the screen
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.700]   and there'll either be like a green, orange,
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460]   or red color next to it.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.660]   Like it's high, it's low, it's borderline.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.100]   And the doctor will basically, it's very algorithmic.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.140]   Oh, your LDL is high, we need to bring it down.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.540]   Oh, your glucose is high, we need to bring it down.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.180]   Oh, your blood pressure is high, we need to bring it down.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.300]   But what I'm inviting people to do
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.900]   is understand a little bit about each test
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300]   and then read the tea leaves
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.980]   of what it's telling us about our mitochondria.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.420]   So let's start with fasting glucose.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.360]   So fasting glucose, when you look at these studies
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.100]   that I'm referring to, they call optimal less than 100.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.300]   So to define whether you were in that 88 or 93%,
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.140]   you had to essentially be in their optimal range
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.180]   for all biomarkers, not on medication.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.980]   So I'll quickly run through what their ranges were.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.100]   My ranges for optimal are tighter than these,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.640]   but fasting glucose less than 100,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.460]   triglycerides less than 150,
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.540]   HDL above 40 for men or 50 for women,
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.760]   hemoglobin A1C less than 5.7%,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   total cholesterol to HDL ratio less than 3.5 to one,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   waist circumference less than 35 inches for women
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.160]   or 40 inches for men,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.880]   and blood pressure less than 120 over 80.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.380]   If those things were in those ranges
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.420]   and you weren't on medication for blood sugar
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.120]   or blood pressure or whatnot,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960]   you were considered optimally metabolically healthy.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.320]   That's now 6.8% of Americans.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.020]   All of these biomarkers are easy to change
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.600]   in one to two months, I would say,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.180]   with simple lifestyle habits.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.220]   - Could you remind us what hemoglobin A1C is?
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.560]   I think most people are familiar with HDL cholesterol
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.460]   being the quote unquote good cholesterol
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.820]   and LDL being the bad cholesterol.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.380]   And as I say that, I know I'm gonna get dogpiled.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.060]   - Yeah, totally, yeah.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.180]   - I'm not sure that I adhere to that.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.420]   I'm not sure I don't adhere to that.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.260]   I'm not sure about a lot of things,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.940]   but I am sure that most people think of them that way.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.560]   - So just to stay functional here,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   we'll frame it that way for now with the caveat
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.360]   that that might not be the whole story,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.520]   isn't the whole story.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.960]   But triglycerides, fat in the blood, fatty stuff.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.180]   - What's so key to understand about the triglycerides,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.600]   we don't wanna confuse triglycerides with eating more fat.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.400]   Triglycerides are a storage form
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.880]   of excess carbohydrates in the blood.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   So this is why it can tell us something about,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.560]   and I know you and Rob Lustig talked about this at length,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.400]   but it's-
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.220]   - And Lane Norton.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.060]   - And Lane, yeah.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.600]   - Yeah, I mean, one of the things that's really tricky,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.760]   gosh, is that the language around nutrition and health
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.680]   is complicated because people hear the word fat,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.080]   they think body fat,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.760]   but then they also think the macronutrient fat.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   We just need more words to better parse the reality.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.280]   In biology, we call the two major groups of people,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.600]   lumpers and splitters.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.640]   Lumpers like to lump everything together.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.360]   It oversimplifies and complicates.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.880]   Splitters like to split everything,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.120]   give a name for everything,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.520]   individual name for everything.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.360]   It complicates.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.720]   And so there's a middle ground, right?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.760]   There's a land of reasonable people and nomenclature.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.340]   And unfortunately that does not exist on the internet,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.240]   nor does it exist in any one specific subfield
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.140]   of medicine or science.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.440]   I mean, so much of the confusion out in the world
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.320]   is because of a lack of adequate language
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.240]   in order to explain.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   Okay, so the triglycerides are a reflection
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.480]   of excess carbohydrate intake.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.680]   - And how it's helping us with that tapestry
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.320]   of understanding the trifecta of bad energy
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.400]   is that if you think about it,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   let's just go back to that cell
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.880]   and that poor mitochondria
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.640]   that's being absolutely decimated by our environment
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   and its capacity is low.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.900]   Okay, so that mitochondria is like,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.680]   I can't process glucose or fatty acids to ATP very well,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.160]   so I'm gonna block their entry into the cell.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.300]   So now you've got glucose rising in the bloodstream.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.740]   So, okay, fasting glucose,
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.800]   that was one of our biomarkers.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.040]   If that's going up,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.020]   that is a little bit of that tapestry
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.720]   of maybe something's going on inside the cell
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.160]   that's blocking the entry into the cell,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.280]   so it's rising the bloodstream.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.000]   Okay, well, where's all that?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.200]   The body does not want lots of glucose
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   floating around in the bloodstream
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.360]   because it can literally independently cause
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.620]   endothelial dysfunction,
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.160]   which is basically blood vessel problems.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.720]   It can cause oxidative stress in the bloodstream.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.960]   It can cause glycation,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.520]   which is sugar literally just sticking to things.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.680]   The body doesn't want that glucose high in the bloodstream,
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   so it converts it to triglycerides to be stored
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   in a storage form of energy.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.820]   That's a key point that I think is helpful to understand
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.720]   is that the body,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.660]   it's always trying to like kind of keep things
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.640]   in the right range, so it'll convert things.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.360]   So then triglycerides,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.000]   a picture in your blood of glucose being high
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.200]   and triglycerides being high
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.840]   is very much should signal to everyone
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.960]   when they look at their labs
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.880]   that there's probably something going on inside the cell
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.440]   that's blocking the cell from being able to use and process.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.420]   It's a sign of mitochondrial dysfunction
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.040]   and chronic overnutrition.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.080]   Too much substrate, not enough processing,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.000]   glucose is gonna go up, triglycerides are gonna go up.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.800]   And so then if you kind of squint and read the tea leaves,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   it's like, huh, I think metabolic dysfunction.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.200]   And what's fascinating is that the travesty
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.280]   in our healthcare system
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   is that a patient might go into the doctor
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.520]   and their fasting glucose is 99,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.200]   one point under what we'd consider the normal range,
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.080]   and their triglycerides are 149,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.600]   one point under what we'd consider the normal range
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.500]   from these things.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.820]   That doctor might say to that patient, you're totally fine.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.460]   Both glucose and triglycerides are normal.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.740]   But that's just really problematic
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.000]   because they're on the upper end of normal
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.600]   for both of those.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.260]   And so really what that would say to me
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.580]   as someone thinking about the mitochondria
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.300]   is like this person is definitely
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.720]   metabolically dysfunctional.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.660]   They're on the highest end of normal
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.420]   for both triglycerides and glucose.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.440]   There's something,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.520]   there's definitely insulin resistance going on here.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.660]   I would much rather see that glucose at 73
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.580]   and that triglyceride at 50,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.340]   which to me would say, oh,
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.220]   this cell's processing through energy, great,
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.080]   and things are moving through,
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.180]   and we're not backing up in the bloodstream,
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.580]   we're not converting to triglycerides.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.020]   So that's where really optimal ranges get in.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.900]   But so that's glucose and triglycerides.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.380]   Why, if those are starting to creep up,
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.140]   it's a sign that something is happening metabolically.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.140]   And then when we look at some of the other biomarkers,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.840]   so hemoglobin A1c is really,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.520]   so that's a marker that's looking at
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.480]   how many of the hemoglobin molecules
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.080]   that are in the red blood cells that carry oxygen,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.160]   how many of those hemoglobin molecules
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.200]   have sugar stuck to them?
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.960]   And that's glycation.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.560]   So you're looking at glycated hemoglobin,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.280]   and you can imagine that if the concentration of glucose
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.040]   is higher over time,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.120]   more glucose is gonna stick to red blood cells,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.220]   and that's gonna create a higher percentage
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.060]   of glycated hemoglobin.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.220]   So that's why that lab is represented as a percentage.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.220]   So less than 5.7 is what we want.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.260]   - You want those cells nice and smooth and slippery.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.100]   - Nice and smooth, no sugar stuck to them,
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.440]   causing dysfunction.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.380]   And because blood cells last for about nine to 120 days,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.920]   hemoglobin A1c is giving us a basically a snapshot
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.420]   of average blood sugar levels over nine to 120 days.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.540]   And if that average is higher, again,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.440]   probably a sign that cells are rejecting glucose
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.500]   from the cell and it's causing a rise in the bloodstream.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.840]   And then just talking about one other biomarker in that,
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   that we talked about, which was blood pressure,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.900]   people might say, well, how does blood pressure relate
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.720]   to like what's going on inside the cell,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.700]   you know, in the mitochondria and whatnot?
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.040]   And a really, the fascinating link is that
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.200]   when that cell becomes insulin resistance,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.700]   which again is a compensatory mechanism
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.700]   for mitochondrial dysfunction,
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.220]   the insulin is gonna rise in the blood
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.600]   'cause the body's insulin resistant.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.320]   So the body's gonna churn out more insulin
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.880]   to try and overcome the insulin block
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.240]   to drive the sugar into the cells.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.360]   So insulin levels rise.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   Well, insulin is one of the key activators of nitric oxide,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.160]   which is the molecule in the blood that dilates
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.600]   and relaxes blood vessels.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.560]   And so when we become insulin resistant
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.940]   and we're not responding to that insulin signal,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.880]   we end up getting less nitric oxide activity.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   So this is how kind of looking at even these very basic,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.680]   very cheap biomarkers through the lens
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.320]   of basic cellular physiology,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.200]   we can start to see, man, my body might be like underpowered.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.760]   I might have a mitochondrial issue here.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.120]   So that's a few of those tests
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.640]   that we really wanna shoot for.
