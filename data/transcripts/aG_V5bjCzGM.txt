[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (Music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hello everyone and welcome to this final episode of the week.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Pastor John joined us today remotely over Skype for this question.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   A question that comes all the way from a believer in Hong Kong.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John, what can I say to my friend that refuses
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   to study the Bible for himself because he thinks he can get all
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   the answers from teachers like you and others online?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   He thinks that hours spent listening to good and faithful expositions of
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   scripture is time better spent than reading the Bible for himself.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   He thinks sermons are less confusing and more efficient in his pursuit
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   to comprehend the message of the Bible. How would you make the case
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   otherwise? Well, when I saw this question
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I was really eager to say something about it because
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   just this morning when I read the question
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I was on a Zoom call with two precious friends
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   exulting together over Psalm 119
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   97 to 100 which
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   addresses this very issue
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   directly and ties into my own personal
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   experience and fills me with a longing to help this young brother
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   wake up both to the preciousness
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   of what he's missing and the danger
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   that he's in if he keeps thinking
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   that mere human teachers can replace
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   the very Word of God as the focus of
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   his meditation. So, let me start
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   with that passage of scripture and show how relevant it is
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   to his question and what it has meant to me
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   in my personal experience and then give
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   two other reasons for why I think he should
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   give himself primarily to serious, prayerful
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   personal meditation directly
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   on God's Word rather than
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   assuming that he will be better off receiving
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   God's Word always through the filter of human teachers.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So, here's what the psalmist wrote in Psalm 119
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   97 following. "Oh, how I love
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   your law. It is my meditation
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   all the day. Your commandment makes me
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   wiser than my enemies, for it is ever
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   with me. I have more understanding than
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   all my teachers, for your testimonies are my
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   meditation. I understand more than the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   aged, for I keep your precepts."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   When I was in graduate school in Germany, which is 45
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   years ago or so, I was in my 20s,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I was surrounded by
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   world-class, high-powered
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   scholarship in people who did not believe
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   the scriptures as God's Word or share my love for
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   the gospel. I knew that given my limits
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I could never read as much as they read
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   or remember as much as they remember or have my
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   have in my head as many historical facts as they
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   did, but I took tremendous
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   heart from Psalm 119
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   verse 99. It had a powerful effect on my
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   perseverance and confidence that God would make
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   himself known to me, that he would keep me
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   from doctrinal error and that he would use me
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   even as much or more than those folks
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to make an impact on the world for his
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   name. And here's what the verse says. "I
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   have more understanding than all my teachers."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Really? How can you say that? "Because
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   your testimonies are my meditation."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Now, when the psalmist said that, it's
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   very likely he was talking about esteemed
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   teachers who were looking at the same record of God's
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Word that he was looking at. And the difference is that the
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   psalmist believed that a direct
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   sustained, personal, love-filled
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   meditation on the Word of God
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   itself would produce in his mind
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and his heart a kind of discernment
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and a kind of insight that would protect him from
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   errors in his teachers and indeed would give
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   him an authentic, personal, true
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   understanding of God and his ways that would go
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   beyond what he got from his teachers
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   or what they got from their way of study. Now,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that was enormously important and
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   encouraging and protecting to me. It meant
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   that I didn't feel like I was at
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   the mercy of scholarship. I had access
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   to something so powerful and so precious
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   that by personal, prayerful, sustained,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   thoughtful, rigorous, love-soaked
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   meditation, I would see things and comprehend
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   things and taste things that these teachers
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   didn't see, didn't comprehend, didn't taste. And
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   frankly, looking back 50 years now, I believe it's true.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I believe God granted me to see beautiful
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   things that many of my more sophisticated,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   even more intelligent teachers did not see.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But the text is even more amazing than that.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And this is what I saw this morning
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   as we were pondering these verses together.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It says, "Your commandment makes me wiser than
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   my enemies, for it is ever with me."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And then in the middle it says what I was just talking about, "I have more understanding
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation." And then it says again,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   "I understand more than the aged, for I keep your precepts."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So there are three steps. One, "Your word is ever with me." Two,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "It's my constant meditation." And three, "I obey it."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And when I do that, I exceed three
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   groups of people in three ways. I exceed my enemies,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   presumably in their subtleties so that they can't trip me
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   up and bring me to ruin. Two, I exceed my teachers
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   in their doctrinal grasp of things so they can't
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   mislead me in false doctrine. And three, I exceed the aged
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   so that all their life experience can't intimidate me if it should
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   point me away from God's way. So, my
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   first response to our friend in Hong Kong is
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "Do you believe these words?" Do you believe
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   the scripture? Do you believe that having the word of God
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   with you, meditating on it day and night,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   and obeying it will bear better fruit
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   of insight and wisdom in your life than always depending on
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   other human teachers? That's the question facing you. Do you believe it? Are you
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   content to be a second-hander for the rest of your life
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   in view of Psalm 119, verse 99
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and what it promises? Here's my second response.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The Bible makes clear that when we are taught something
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   by somebody, or when somebody makes
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   some prophetic pronouncement to us, we are to test all things
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and hold fast to what is good. 1 Thessalonians 5, 21.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We are to test the spirits. 1 John 4, 1. And Paul
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   gave us the criterion for the test in 1 Corinthians 14, 37.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   If anyone thinks that he's a prophet or spiritual, he should
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   acknowledge that "the things I write to you are a
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   command of the Lord." If anyone does not recognize this, he's
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   not recognized. In other words, Paul's word, the
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   apostolic word, not the word of any human teacher, John Piper
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   included, is the criterion by which
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   we judge the truth and authenticity of teachers.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   So I would simply ask our young friend there in Hong Kong
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   if you are using teachers, human
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   teachers, as the sole means of
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   understanding God's word, by what will you
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   judge the teachers with any confidence?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And finally, a third thing I would say is
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I think there's a love problem. I mean a
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   problem with the way God and his precious word are being loved by
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   this brother. Something's wrong with the taste
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   palate of the tongue of your soul if you
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   need to have the food of God's word always
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   spiced with the words of a fallible human being.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Something is wrong. Do you ever say with the
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   psalmist, "Oh, how I love your
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   law. It is my meditation all
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   the day." Or, to put it starkly,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   something is amiss in a love relationship if
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   every time a lover gets a letter from his beloved
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and instead of reading it slowly,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I can't help but think back on being a
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   water safety instructor in 1967, madly in love
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   with Noel who was 700 miles away. And I'll tell you when one of those
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   lavender envelopes came in the mail, I just went out in the woods and smelled
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   it. [laughter] Okay, alright, this came to me.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Let's see if I can find my thought here. If every time a lover gets
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   a letter from his beloved, instead of reading it,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   smelling it slowly as if to savor
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   every word revealing the heart and the mind of the beloved,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   he goes searching for somebody else to read the letter to him
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and then talk to him about the letter? That's a
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   defective relationship. I mean, this is serious.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So, perhaps at the bottom of the problem is that our friend has
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   so completely intellectualized his
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   faith that the only category in which he
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   thinks, the only category that's going to profit
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   him, he thinks, is the category of verbal
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   explanation. There's a lot of people who think about
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   sermons that way. They just think about, I need some more
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   information, I need some more explanation, rather than
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   also the heartfelt exultation
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   that a lover has in reading the very words of his beloved.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So, those are my three questions. Number one, do you
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   believe Psalm 119.99? Number two,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   how will you test the reliability of your teachers by the Word of God?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Three, why do you want to avoid the immediate
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   authentic experience of savoring your love letter
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   by asking someone else to read it for you? Really good word.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for listening wherever you are, Hong Kong,

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We are back on Monday with a Bible question on Matthew 8.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   In this text, why did the demons ask Jesus' permission to be
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   sent into the pigs when those pigs would be
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   immediately drowned? I'm Tony Rehnke. We'll find out on Monday
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   with Pastor John back in studio. We'll see you then.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   [silence]
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
