[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   Welcome back to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.340]   Our next question comes from an engaged man,
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.940]   Evan is his name, who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.140]   Pastor John, I'm getting married
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.740]   in exactly 100 days from now.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.380]   I'm 21 years old, my bride-to-be, Emily, is 18.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.100]   I'm a student ministries intern at my church.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.620]   We met last March and began a long-distance relationship
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.240]   after we met when her college trip
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.140]   and my student ministry retreat overlapped
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.560]   at a camp between our states in Wyoming.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380]   We have clearly felt God lead us to be married,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.300]   and our mentors, church leaders, parents,
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.980]   and close friends have affirmed our decision to be married.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100]   I'm excited to take on the role of loving a woman
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.700]   like Christ did the church,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.860]   but as the day draws nearer and nearer,
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.460]   I am made more and more aware of my need for wisdom
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.500]   and help to become a husband capable of loving my wife well.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.300]   I'll be re-listening to all of the episodes on marriage,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.220]   but with all that being said,
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.500]   what advice do you have for me?
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.740]   What are the most important questions we need to ask
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.020]   and likely are not asking due to the rushing excitement
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.420]   of the engagement phase?
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.460]   What would you say, Pastor John,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.260]   to Evan and to his fiance?
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.460]   - Well, the first thing I want to do
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.660]   is send him over to DesiringGod.org
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.620]   to download a document called
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.500]   "Questions to Ask When Preparing for Marriage."
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500]   The more issues you can talk about now,
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.100]   together, before marriage, the better.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.900]   It's far more frustrating and threatening
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.640]   to think of something after you're married
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.020]   that you should have talked about before,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.460]   which leads me to the second thing I would say,
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580]   besides go get the document.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.260]   Don't shy away, Evan,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.420]   from any issue or conversation with your fiance
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.660]   in these days in order to avoid conflict.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.520]   Now is the time to have every conflict you can have
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.360]   that might come up later.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   If you think that you can dodge conflicts now
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.940]   so that there will be a more opportune time later,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.620]   you're mistaken.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.620]   This is what engagement or courtship is designed for,
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.780]   maximum exposure to what each of you thinks,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.500]   believes, feels, does habitually or occasionally,
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.140]   no secrets, nothing held back.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.160]   You don't want marriage to be based on ignorance,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.220]   but on trust in the face of all truth.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.380]   The next thing I would say to Evan
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.640]   is that these are golden months
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   in which to set patterns of spiritual leadership
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.660]   in which you take the initiative to read the Bible,
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.180]   pray, think, study, talk together
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.180]   about all kinds of biblical and spiritual realities.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.460]   I'm assuming that you agree
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.820]   that you both need to be on the same theological page.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.580]   That's not an artificial expectation.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.520]   This means that if you're going to pull together
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   shoulder to shoulder in marriage for some great purpose,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.020]   which is what marriage is for,
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.160]   you have to be pulling in the same direction.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.940]   That is, seeing God in the same way
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.740]   and seeing Christ and seeing the Holy Spirit
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.380]   and seeing faith and seeing love and salvation
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.420]   and heaven and hell and Satan and sin
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940]   and holiness and obedience,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.060]   seeing all these things in the same way.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.980]   Otherwise, pulling together in harness
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.600]   will start to become very painful
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.940]   as you jerk each other around
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.300]   in different directions spiritually.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.980]   Or more likely what happens
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.980]   is you just stop talking spiritually, which is worse.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.880]   So take the initiative and go deep
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.340]   into every dimension of the spiritual life
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.680]   that you can in these days.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.640]   And the next thing I would say,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.780]   and this applies to both of you,
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.380]   is that your own personal fellowship of faith
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.620]   and joy and hope and obedience toward Jesus
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.140]   is foundational for the survival
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.260]   and the flourishing of your marriage.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.180]   The marriages that I watch unravel,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   unravel in tandem with the unraveling of spiritual reality.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.960]   One or both of the couples falls away from Jesus.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.380]   When that happens, the spiritual resources
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.380]   for handling the normal conflicts vanish.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.300]   And so the point is, don't just think
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   that what you do together strengthens the marriage.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.780]   Far more important,
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.820]   and this may sound like an overstatement,
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.740]   but I thought about it and I'm gonna stick by it.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.740]   Far more important is what you do apart from each other
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.180]   as each of you meets Jesus and consecrates yourself
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.680]   afresh over and over so that your devotion to Christ
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   is absolutely unshakable personally between you and him,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.620]   and your experience of him is profoundly satisfying.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.620]   When two people operate out of that individual profundity,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.220]   the marriage will endure and not only endure,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.240]   flourish with joy and fruitfulness.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.480]   Now, of all the hundreds of things that need to be said
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.280]   and could be said, here's one last thing to say.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.180]   Don't assume that your affection for your bride-to-be
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.100]   is known and felt by her.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   Instead, put it on your lips over and over again.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.060]   And over again every day.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.100]   Find fresh ways to say it.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.200]   Say it, not just show it.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.460]   Say it.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.220]   Lots of guys think, "Why show it?
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.820]   I earn a living.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.940]   I guard her, I protect her."
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.060]   Look, yes, show it.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.380]   Yes, show it.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.660]   Do the kinds of deeds she loves for you to do,
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.300]   but don't just do things.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.860]   Say things.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.300]   This is true for both of you, but I'm talking to you, Evan.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.300]   Lavish your wife with expressions of delight
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.620]   and appreciation and admiration and affection
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.320]   and enjoyment in your wedding vows.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.100]   I hope you're going to promise to cherish her
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.080]   above all others and forsake everyone else,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.460]   cleaving to her alone.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.460]   Put that cherishing and that cleaving into words every day.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.340]   This will pay dividends of great joy
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.140]   and great deep bonding of soul
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.140]   at a very, very wonderfully profound and happy level.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.240]   It's true that there's a warning in the Book of Solomon,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.620]   in the Song of Solomon,
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.520]   not to stir up love until it satisfies.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.420]   That means, I think, among other things,
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.980]   perhaps you can immerse yourself in this book
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.300]   in a premature and inappropriate way
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.860]   because in the vernacular,
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.300]   it can turn you on in premature ways.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.380]   But, but, I'm going to risk it anyway and say,
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.880]   go to that book and learn what I'm talking about here.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   Learn how to put into words, to her face,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.900]   the cherishing that you feel for her.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.500]   May God bless you in these months.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.340]   - Amen, good word.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.900]   And thank you, Evan, for today's question.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.180]   We are going to return on Wednesday
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.740]   and we're going to hear from a leader who is wiped out,
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.900]   spiritually and emotionally and mentally drained in his work
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.220]   and he wants to know how to use his downtime
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.300]   to recharge and whether it's possible to recharge his body
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.120]   and recharge his soul at the same time.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.460]   It's a really good and important question
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.520]   coming up on Wednesday for anyone who is feeling tired
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.780]   and needs to be refreshed.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.980]   Well, you've been listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.060]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
