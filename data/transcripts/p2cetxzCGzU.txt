[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   At some point you're going to run out of the smartest, the remainder of the
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.880]   smartest people in the world, if you've admitted all the brilliant people, given
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.480]   how big the U S population is to begin with, you're not going to change the
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.800]   median that much by doing that.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.160]   Right.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.520]   So it's, it's almost a goal into just having more births from the average
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.560]   American, like if the average American just had more kids, the population would
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.440]   still grow and the relative effect of the brightest people might dilute a little bit.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.720]   Um, but, and that, maybe that's a huge tragedy.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.440]   We don't know without a bunch of extra math and a bunch of weird assumptions.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   We don't know.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.040]   So like, I, there's a point at which I have to say, like, I don't know.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.160]   Right.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.800]   Is diluting the power of the smartest person in America, like keeping us from
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   having wondrous miracles all around us all the time?
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   I mean, probably not, but I don't know.
