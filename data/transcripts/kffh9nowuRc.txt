[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.520]   - Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast number 13.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   Today we have a special guest, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   Dr. Bernstein is a neurologist, financial historian,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.560]   author, advisor, and overall, really smart guy.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:41.960]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, podcast number 13.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.940]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host of this podcast.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.520]   This episode, along with all episodes,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.480]   are brought to you by the John C. Bogle
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   Center for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.180]   Today, my special guest is Dr. William Bernstein,
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.140]   a favorite of the Boglehead community.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.140]   Dr. Bernstein is a neurologist, financial historian,
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.460]   author, advisor, and a walking encyclopedia.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.560]   Jack Bogle used to refer to Bill Bernstein
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.940]   as the smartest guy in the room.
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.480]   I always joke that when I have lunch with Bill,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.920]   the three of us have a great conversation.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.960]   So, with no further ado, it is my great pleasure
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   to have on the Bogleheads on Investing podcast,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.720]   Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   Welcome, Dr. Bernstein.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.360]   - Hey, glad to talk to you, Rick.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.300]   And by the way, my first name is not doctor.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.140]   - It isn't?
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.180]   But everybody refers to you as doctor.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.040]   (laughing)
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   - It gives me the creepy crawlies.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.780]   (laughing)
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.120]   I get PTSD, and I pretend I've got a white coat on, you know?
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.480]   (laughing)
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.320]   - You know, I work with a lot of doctors,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.240]   and a lot of them are a lot less formal
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.680]   about being called doctor than it was, say, 25 years ago.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.960]   Do you find that?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.280]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.360]   There's no question.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   I mean, I think that physicians these days
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.580]   are a whole lot more emotionally mature,
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.720]   at least young physicians are,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.180]   than they were 30 and 40 years ago.
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.000]   - Just for the funny, any time I even put in an email,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   you know, Dr. Smith or Dr. Jones, male or female,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   they'll always come back and say, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.620]   You know, call me by my first name.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.100]   So, I've just stopped doing the doctor thing.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.040]   They don't seem to mind, but when I was young,
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   you called a doctor, doctor.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.280]   So, Bill, Bill, how are you?
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.720]   (laughing)
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.520]   - I'm fine, Rick, and how about you?
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   - I'm doing well.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.640]   So, speaking of doctors,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.720]   but you were a neurologist at one time, is that correct?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.560]   Did I say that correctly?
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.680]   - Correct.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.200]   For 25, yes.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.160]   - 25 years, and did you do operations?
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.400]   Like, I'm just curious, did you go deep into pain,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.240]   or what did you do?
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.060]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.960]   There's a difference between a neurologist
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   and a neurosurgeon.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.120]   A neurosurgeon is the guy or gal who operates,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   and neurologists are medical doctors.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.960]   We work a lot with neurosurgeons,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   and they work a lot with us,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.480]   but we don't operate.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.240]   And it loses me the opportunity to tell a really good joke,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.000]   which is that people look at me and say,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.120]   how hard was it to learn finance at your age?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   And I like to tell them that, well, yeah,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.960]   finance is hard, but it's not brain surgery.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.160]   (laughing)
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   - Yeah, at one point, you decided enough
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.360]   of all of the noise on Wall Street,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.720]   and you were gonna go out and investigate this on your own,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.960]   because you had come to the realization
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.360]   that what was going on out there on Wall Street
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.100]   was not working, at least not for you.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.600]   And you started going down the path of learning on your own,
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.680]   which a lot of physicians are now,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.920]   which I find great, by the way.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.860]   A lot of people are self-learning like you did.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.200]   But you just kept on going after you went down that path,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.720]   and you got so into it
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.400]   that you decided to start writing books,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.840]   and you actually opened up an investment company.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.480]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.400]   - Well, sure.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.120]   I mean, I live in a country
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.600]   that doesn't have a functioning social welfare system,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.080]   so I had to basically save and invest on my own.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.160]   And I had scientific training,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.360]   and I approached investing the way I thought
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.840]   that any scientist would,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.060]   which is you read the basic tests,
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.460]   the peer-reviewed literature,
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.640]   you collect data, you built models.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.280]   And I went and did all those things,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.120]   and by the time I'd finished doing this in the early 1990s,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   I realized that I had something
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   that was useful to other small investors.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.000]   And so I wrote my first book,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.520]   "The Intelligent Asset Allocator,"
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.320]   as basically an online book in 1995,
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.560]   and I give credit to Frank Armstrong
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.100]   for telling me that I should do that.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.740]   And the rest just followed from that.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.020]   You can't write about finance without two things happening.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.260]   Number one is people ask you to start managing money,
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.620]   and number two, and more subtly,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.580]   you come to the realization
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.920]   that you can't write about finance
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.140]   without writing about the history of finance
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.900]   and the history of economics.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.380]   And so that opened up yet another career,
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.340]   which is writing books about economic growth and trade
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.660]   and things like that.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.180]   - Yeah, and I want to go down that path a little bit
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.700]   because I want to eventually talk about Brexit
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.780]   and trade deals that are going on with China
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.120]   and how all that affects us.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.060]   But so from your lens, having written,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.220]   is it four history books now or economic history?
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.860]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm working on my fourth.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.340]   I've written three so far,
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.260]   and there's a fourth that'll be coming out
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.820]   in about a year's time from now.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.180]   - So Bill, the first economic history book you wrote
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.420]   was "The Birth of Plenty."
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.020]   Just briefly what you learned in that book
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.620]   and then how that led to the next book.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.340]   - It's a long, shaggy dog story,
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.540]   but one of the reasons why I became interested
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.760]   not only in economic history but also in finance itself
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.580]   is because I knew 35 years ago
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.100]   that the most successful economies
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.020]   and the world's most successful securities markets
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.540]   existed in countries that spoke English.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.220]   All of the daughter countries,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.300]   great daughter countries of England,
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.380]   the United States, Canada, New Zealand,
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.460]   Australia, South Africa, all had very successful economies
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.140]   and all had securities markets with higher returns.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.300]   Very few other countries matched that.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.620]   Sweden, Switzerland came fairly close.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.380]   And I wondered why that was.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.260]   And it turns out it's nothing to do
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.580]   with the English language,
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.220]   but what it does have everything to do with
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.220]   is English common law.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.300]   And I quickly came to the realization
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.340]   that it was English institutions
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.340]   and particularly the common rule of law
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.100]   and equality under the law
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.060]   that were behind the prosperity.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.060]   And of course, that's not an original line.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.940]   To me, Doug North got a Nobel Prize
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.260]   for realizing that 30 years ago.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.980]   That's how I came to write "Birth of Plenty,"
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.140]   which was a modestly successful book.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.940]   And as I had just finished that book,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.100]   I get this phone call from a man
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.020]   by the name of Brando Skyhorse,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.380]   who it turned out was an acquisitions editor
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.020]   for Grove Atlantic Press.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.100]   And he said, "I'd like you to write a book
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.060]   "about economic history of trade,
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.420]   "the economic history of trade."
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.300]   And so I said, "Well, in the first place,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.380]   "I don't know anything about it.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.060]   "In the second place, I'm not interested in it.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.140]   "And in the third place, you've got the wrong Bernstein,
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.820]   "the person you wanted was, of course,
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.980]   "Peter Bernstein." - Peter Bernstein,
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.820]   of course. (laughs)
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.420]   - Yeah, and there was this awkward silence
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.460]   at the end of the line, and he said,
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.380]   "Well, we had lunch with him last week,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.060]   "and we did offer him the project."
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.660]   And he said that he was busy.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.860]   He was writing his history of the Erie Canal at the time.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.780]   And Peter said, "But there's this other Bernstein
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.980]   "you ought to read."
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.620]   So I said, "I don't know.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.060]   "There's other things I wanna write."
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.300]   And I went out into the family room
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.500]   where my wife was finishing her coffee
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.220]   and "The New York Times" crossword puzzle.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.820]   And she puts down her coffee,
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.980]   and she puts down "The New York Times" crossword puzzle,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.380]   and she says, "You know who Grove Atlantic Press is?"
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.860]   And I said, "No."
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.860]   And she said, "Well, you've heard of the Atlantic Monthly?"
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.020]   And I said, "Yes, I know the Atlantic Monthly."
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.860]   And she said, "And you know what Grove Press is?"
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.540]   And I said, "Well, yeah, you know Doris Lessing,
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.260]   "and P.J. O'Rourke, and Henry Miller,
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.660]   "and people like that."
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.820]   And she said, "Write."
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.980]   She said, "If you value your career
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.340]   "as a nonfiction writer,
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.660]   "you will write whatever it is they want you to write."
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.500]   - Okay.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.540]   - So that's how I came to write "Splendid Exchange,"
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.100]   which succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.700]   It was very well received.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.740]   And I mean, one occasionally gets bad reviews
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.620]   on places like Amazon,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.340]   but the major media reviews that I got
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.260]   were uniformly positive.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.460]   And it's also been the source of any number
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.980]   of really interesting speaking gigs over the past 10 years.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.060]   - Bill, from the perspective of trade,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.500]   we're in a interesting situation in history right now
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.860]   where we're beginning to see trade wars
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.740]   that one could argue we are starting,
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.300]   not only between us and China,
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.500]   but there might be issues with Brexit,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.820]   for example, between the UK and continental Europe
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.500]   and Ireland.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.180]   We see trade wars, if you will,
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.300]   and trade problems potentially increasing in the future.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.580]   Based on your work and your knowledge of it,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.660]   where do you see these things going?
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.380]   - Well, not in a good place.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.780]   To say that trade wars are easy to win
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.540]   is akin to wearing a bright neon sign on your forehead
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.780]   that says, "I don't know the first thing about history."
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.420]   We had trade wars in the 1930s,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.460]   and not only were they disastrous
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.100]   from a geopolitical point of view,
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.060]   but they were disastrous
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.420]   from a military point of view as well.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.340]   You can make a very good case that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.340]   and the other tariffs that gave a rise to in retaliation
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.940]   were a direct cause of World War II.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.540]   And it's not an accident that the people
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.420]   who set up what became the World Trade Organization
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.340]   were people in the State Department who swore,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.820]   "Never again, we're never going to have this again.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.620]   We want an international order
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.980]   that prevents the geopolitical catastrophe
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.340]   you get from trade wars."
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.660]   It does appear highly likely
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.540]   that Britain will go crashing out of the EU.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.220]   And if that happens,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.180]   it will not be an entirely negative event
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.100]   for the following reason,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.900]   which is it will prove to be a relatively cheap object lesson
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.780]   about what happens when you follow protectionism
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.180]   to its final conclusion.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.380]   If you think you can destroy the international trade order
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.780]   and thumb your nose at it,
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.180]   or an organization like the EU and get away with it,
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.140]   you're going to be sadly mistaken.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.100]   You know, I always thought it was useful
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.380]   to have a couple of communist regimes around,
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.100]   like North Korea and Cuba,
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.820]   as object lessons to the rest of the world,
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.740]   in terms of the risks and the costs
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.780]   of a truly communist form of government.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.260]   - Well, that's an interesting perspective, Bill.
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.100]   So basically, there's a lot more to trade wars
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.900]   than just trade.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.220]   There's a very predictable sequence of events
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.260]   that occurs when you start a trade war.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.700]   In the first place, you're shooting yourself in the foot
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.300]   because it's a tax on your consumers.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   To anyone who doubts that,
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.220]   I suggest you go out
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.260]   and try and buy a washing machine right now.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.620]   So that's the first thing that happens.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.300]   Secondly, it damages your own domestic corporations
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.060]   who need foreign inputs
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.420]   because they're going to be spending a lot more.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.460]   The third thing that happens
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.820]   is that you get retaliatory tariffs.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.380]   And then the fourth things that happens
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.820]   is you get shooting wars.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.260]   And history is rife with trade wars
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.500]   that evolved into shooting wars.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.980]   I mean, the Dutch and the British fought four of them
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.460]   a couple of centuries ago,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.780]   just over the issue of trade.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.660]   Why did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.780]   Well, they attacked Pearl Harbor
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.980]   because we embargoed their oil.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.900]   You're playing with fire.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.980]   It's a stupid thing to do.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.340]   - Well, let's move on to the masters of the word.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.340]   And I recall, I read the book before you published it.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.460]   Thank you for letting me do that.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.780]   And I thought it was a fascinating book.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.500]   - Well, it sank like a stone.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.260]   I had a good time writing it.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.180]   And what I learned about it is that,
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.980]   writing a long form history book
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.820]   is really about the process.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.620]   And if you don't enjoy the process,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.340]   you shouldn't be writing the book.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.260]   And it would have been nice
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.060]   if I had gotten the frosting on the cake
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.740]   of a successful book.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.460]   But at the end, I learned an awful lot.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.100]   And the reason why it sank was simply
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.660]   because media academics,
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.940]   who are the people who are gonna be reviewing the book,
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.060]   didn't like it because I didn't pay proper homage
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.660]   to McLuhan and Kittler and Derrida and people like that,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.740]   who I didn't find terribly relevant to my story.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.700]   So it was a lesson in a number of regards.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.540]   - So just to regress a little bit,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.780]   that the book was about the history, if you will,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.900]   of communication and how that affects society.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.060]   - Yeah, the basic thesis of the book
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.060]   was that access to communication technology
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.060]   is what determines politics.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.300]   So for example, in the ancient world,
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.220]   very few people knew how to read and write.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.340]   Not only did they not have the time to do it,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.580]   but the writing systems that were in place
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.020]   were extremely complex and took a long period of time.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.420]   So no one could afford the time to learn them.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.820]   So if you were a scribe, if you could read and write,
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.500]   which had to have been less than 1% of the population,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.620]   you were the combination of a software engineer
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.300]   and a venture capitalist and an investment banker,
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.860]   all rolled up into one.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.060]   You were the person who could basically
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.980]   give everybody else their orders.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.700]   And that changes around 600 or 700 BC
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.140]   when the Greeks inherit the Phoenician writing system,
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.820]   which doesn't have vowels, and they put vowels into it.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.220]   And all of a sudden,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.740]   with the presence of vowels and consonants,
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.220]   a clever five-year-old can learn how to read.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.540]   And at the time of, say, Pericles,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.140]   probably 50% of Greek citizens,
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.900]   who were all, of course, all men, could read and write.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.140]   Well, it's not an accident
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.060]   that democracy develops in ancient Greece.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.460]   And you can jump a couple of millennia ahead of that,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.900]   and you could look at Nazi Germany
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.340]   and see that their degree of control over the population
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.860]   basically stemmed from the fact that they controlled
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.780]   the leading-edge communications technology of the era,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.740]   which was, of course, radio.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.940]   You know, Bret Stephens wrote a very fine column about that
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.500]   in "The New York Times" last week.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.540]   It's not an accident that totalitarianism
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.540]   has its high watermark in the '30s and '40s
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.060]   with the rise of radio.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.060]   - But radio was just a one-way communication.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.900]   It went out, but it didn't come back.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.740]   - Exactly.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.220]   If you wanted to say something back to the radio,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.900]   you were out of luck.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.300]   - So then it entered the internet,
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.260]   and suddenly now it goes both ways and things change again.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.420]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.860]   Now, the question is,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.220]   the other really interesting story was, you know,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.060]   were some of the things
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.220]   that people don't talk about very much
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.340]   that contributed to the fall of communism.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.380]   Obviously, it was a miserable economic system,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.700]   and that didn't help.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.020]   But the Russians, the Soviets,
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.820]   weren't nearly as smart as the Germans
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.340]   because the Germans made radios
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.820]   that made it almost impossible
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.380]   to receive foreign broadcasts, okay?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.500]   The Russians built these very sophisticated
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.180]   shortwave receivers that could get, you know,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.940]   Voice of America, Radio Liberty, the BBC.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.980]   And when you read people like Lech Walesa
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.100]   and Václav Havel, the first thing they tell you
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.860]   is that it wasn't for Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.140]   which, of course, were CIA plants.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.140]   They wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.180]   - And so here we have a situation
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.580]   where instant news everywhere all around the world.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.060]   You know, if a one-tier gas canister gets shot in Hong Kong,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.980]   the whole world knows about it within 10 seconds.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.700]   How is that changing things?
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.140]   - Well, it makes the cost
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.220]   of totalitarian suppression much higher.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.940]   The Hutus in Rwanda, you know, 25 years ago,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.420]   could use the radio to direct their genocide,
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.140]   and the people on the other side
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.420]   didn't have any way of publicizing what was happening.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.580]   Well, if they tried that today,
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.140]   there would be cell phone videos
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.900]   that would be flooding the internet,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.100]   and people would have intervened a whole lot faster.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.660]   I think, you know, the one thing you can,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660]   you know, you can talk about
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.860]   the negative effects of social media,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.340]   but one thing I'm quite certain of,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.820]   which is that the internet and cell phones
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.020]   have made genocide a whole lot harder.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.420]   - Let me ask about what you're working on now.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.180]   I know you're working on another book.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.540]   - (laughs) Well, yeah.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.700]   I'm working on a modern version of a book
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.260]   that I'm sure you've read too,
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.660]   which is 178 years old,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.220]   called "Memoirs of Extraordinary Copter Delusions
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.420]   "and the Madness of Crowds" by Charles Mackay,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.780]   who was a Scotsman.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.220]   And the book is famous, as we both know in finance,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.060]   because it described the three great bubbles
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.940]   of the 17th and 18th century,
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.340]   the tulip mania, which Mackay got completely wrong,
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.300]   and the South Sea and Mississippi Company bubbles,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.460]   which he did a fairly good job with,
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.100]   or at least a fair job with.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.100]   And I can remember reading that book in the 1990s,
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.460]   and thinking to myself, my God, this is fascinating,
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.660]   but I'm never gonna see anything like this, of course.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.940]   And then all of a sudden, right in front of my eyes,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.860]   I saw the same kind of behavior
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.060]   as Mackay observed with tech stocks
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.420]   and the popular mania that surrounded them,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.300]   and it saved me a lot of money.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.580]   And I'm certainly not the only person
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.660]   who had that experience,
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.420]   or by many decades was the first person
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.260]   to have that experience,
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.860]   because the book has been in print ever since 1841,
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.500]   and the 1932 edition, the forward to it,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.940]   was written by Bernard Baruch,
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.140]   who had his bacon saved in 1907 by it.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.180]   So that's the first thing that impressed me about it.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.900]   And then the other thing that really impelled me
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.860]   to write the book was the rise of the Islamic State
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.220]   in the Middle East,
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.260]   and how the Islamic State and their predecessor,
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.540]   ISIS or ISIL, or however you wanna refer to it,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.380]   and how they were able to attract people
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.860]   from tens of thousands of people from around the world,
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.940]   some of them from very comfortable Western societies,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.940]   to hell on earth, and to fight and to die there.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.860]   And of course, Mackay wrote about religious manias too.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.940]   And so I had to write a book
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.180]   that married the two of those together,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.540]   because they were both popular manias,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.980]   both financial manias and religious manias
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.420]   propagate by the same social mechanisms.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.780]   So I wanted to write about that,
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.580]   and that's what I'm finishing up on.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.860]   - And is Bitcoin and cyber currency part of that?
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.620]   I had to ask.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.700]   - It gets about two sentences or three sentences.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.860]   It's just, it's quite frankly,
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.940]   it's not big enough to make it into my book.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.860]   It still makes headlines,
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.180]   but you don't very often meet people
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.140]   who will talk your heads off about it at a cocktail party,
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.660]   which is typically what happens during a mania of any sort.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.460]   - Back in the 1990s, people were experts.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.340]   You go to your local barber to get a haircut,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.940]   and they were experts on tech stocks.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.420]   I don't think you have that with cyber currency.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.180]   I don't think anybody claims to be an expert.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.060]   I think they all know what they're doing is speculation.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.940]   - Although the really interesting thing
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.140]   is that it seems that every other Uber driver
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.140]   that I encounter wants to talk
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.300]   about the inverting yield curve.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.140]   - That's true.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.620]   And negative interest rates
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.380]   get to be a big thing right now as well.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.780]   A lot of people tend to want to talk
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.900]   about negative interest rates,
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.500]   which, you know, speaking of that,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.340]   let's get into this a little bit.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.140]   Negative interest rates are a new phenomenon.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.860]   I mean, as far back as what I can tell, right?
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.820]   Years going back.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.380]   I mean, interest rates may have been low
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.020]   because inflation was low,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.220]   but where do negative interest rates get countries
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   like Germany and Japan, Switzerland?
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.780]   I mean, where does that all go?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.740]   - Well, I tend to look at negative interest rates
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.740]   more as a symptom than as a root cause of anything.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.740]   It's obviously not good for fixed income investors,
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.900]   but what it's a manifestation of
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.220]   is several different things all coming together
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.860]   into a perfect storm.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.740]   Thing number one is something that I like to write about,
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.860]   which is that, you know, societies get wealthier,
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.540]   the rate of return falls.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.580]   And that's true of both stocks and bonds.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.700]   Inequality comes into it as well.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.020]   You know, you have more and more capital
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.580]   getting hidden away into people's accounts,
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.980]   and it's not getting spent.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.540]   You know, people don't have money to spend
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.940]   on rents and houses and food the way they should,
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.500]   and certainly on their children's vacation,
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.620]   because, you know, almost all of the increased income
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.460]   is going to the 1%.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.220]   And what do the 1% do with their money?
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.540]   Well, they put it away into stocks and bonds.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.820]   That's the first thing that's happening.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.580]   The second thing is we've got a tepid economy,
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.340]   and so the demand side for capital is down,
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.220]   so the rate falls because of that.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.900]   And then finally, you've got central banks
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.940]   getting into the act and buying up fixed income assets
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.300]   onto their balance sheets.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.060]   So all three of those things
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.060]   are causing the reduction in interest rates.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.300]   I'm not sure there's anything to do about it,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.380]   but it's just a fact of life.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.420]   The one thing that it does do
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.980]   is it makes people enthusiastic about long bonds,
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.660]   because that's an asset class that's done very well
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.460]   with the fall in interest rates.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.300]   You know, I think that T-bill rates
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.020]   are certainly not as low as they've ever been.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.700]   They were actually, depending on how you measure it,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.500]   negative during the Great Depression very early on.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.980]   But, you know, a long-term, a 30-year Treasury bond
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.260]   is yielding, what, 2.3% or 2.4%.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.380]   That's historically anomalous.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.580]   And so it makes people very excited about long bonds,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.980]   and particularly about leveraged bonds in a portfolio,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.900]   because they've done so well.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.420]   You know, they're an excellent way
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.780]   to chase prior performance.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.220]   - Larry Summers wrote something recently
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.540]   talking about negative interest rates,
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.700]   and he said something that caught my ear.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.660]   Basically, he said, if you have very low interest rates,
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.940]   it keeps a lot of companies around
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.340]   that have no business being around,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.740]   that they should go under.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.420]   And because they're not going under,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.940]   the system is going to become clogged
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.900]   with a lot of deadweight companies
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.180]   that should have gone bankrupt,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.780]   but won't go bankrupt because interest rates are low.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.620]   - Well, yeah.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.980]   I mean, the Austrians, the Austrians,
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.900]   that was something that the Austrians liked to write about.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.540]   You know, Schumpeter certainly wrote about that,
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.100]   and I'm pretty sure that Hayek wrote about it too,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.620]   which is the danger of low interest rates is not inflation.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.140]   Okay, in other words, you can get inflation
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.140]   if you lower interest rates,
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.900]   because people start spending.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.340]   But if you're, you know, beyond the zero lower bound,
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.620]   then simply what happens is
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.620]   that you get asset class bubbles.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.340]   And so a lot of companies wind up getting capital
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.660]   or keeping their capital that, as Larry Summers says,
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.140]   have no business being around.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.540]   - Yeah, one of the things I've noticed
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.300]   is that the tax cuts that corporations got,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.540]   the money, the extra capital that they had that came in,
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.100]   there wasn't really any big spike in capital spending
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.420]   with that money, but what there was was buybacks.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.820]   There were dividend increases,
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.820]   but, you know, the idea of giving companies the tax cut
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.860]   was they would come back and spend more money,
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.340]   invest more money for the future.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.460]   That doesn't seem to be what they're doing.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.060]   - Yeah, we're in a capitalist fool's paradise,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.340]   and I'm not talking about that politically.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.340]   What I mean by, as a capitalist,
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.700]   is anybody who has capital.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.620]   That's you and me.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.180]   And we're in a fool's paradise
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.820]   because we've got these bloated portfolios
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.820]   that are inflated by low interest rates,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.140]   and we feel rich.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.540]   It seems that we're rich,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.660]   but in fact, the earning power of what we own,
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.380]   and certainly the dividend stream from what we own
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.220]   and the interest stream from what we own
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.620]   is not all that impressive.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.900]   If you have to live on your income now, you're in trouble.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.540]   - Yeah, which gets us to where do you put your money?
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.180]   You know, with the potential
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.820]   for even lower interest rates in the US.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.300]   Now, I know that that's not a popular opinion
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.420]   about where interest rates are going,
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.860]   but we have 1.4% on the 10-year,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.580]   and I think the probability of the 10-year
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.900]   dropping below 1% is as high as the probability
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.660]   of it going over 3%.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.420]   So, I mean, we could have even lower interest rates
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.340]   going forward.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.740]   You know, we have earnings that are slowing.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.060]   Dividends increases,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.420]   which are better than what they were in the past,
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.260]   but they're slowing too.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.660]   We have, you know, no more tax cut on the corporate side.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.900]   We already had that.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.220]   Buybacks are beginning to slow.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.460]   Where do you put your money, Bill?
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.860]   (Bill laughing)
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.460]   - I put my money where I've always put it,
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.340]   which is in a prudent mixed portfolio.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.740]   I don't know where else to put it.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.980]   I'm not gonna put it under the mattress.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.740]   I'm not gonna buy, you know, a ton or two of gold.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.980]   You keep, I've always, you know,
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.980]   I've always kept my fixed income durations fairly low
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.100]   so that if things spike up,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.820]   I don't lose too much money there.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.700]   And, you know, you have to own some equities.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.220]   Equities abroad are not badly priced.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.980]   European, Japanese equities are at least reasonably priced.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.140]   Emerging markets equities
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.900]   are even more than reasonably priced.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.900]   You know, on the other hand,
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.420]   I'm going to be spending in dollars,
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.380]   so I'm not gonna be investing, you know,
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.140]   much more than 40% of my money abroad.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.580]   - Anytime I put something on the Bogle heads
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.900]   about expected returns from equities
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.340]   or fixed income going forward,
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.740]   I always get a lot of pushback.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.780]   Oh, you don't know what they're going to be.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.660]   You know, nobody knows what the returns are going to be.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.820]   But in order to invest your money,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.340]   in order to come up with an asset allocation
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.220]   and some sort of an investment plan,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.620]   you need to have estimates of return for equities
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.540]   and estimates of return for fixed income
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.660]   and estimates of return for cash.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.020]   And I know I have my estimates, which I use.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.580]   What are your estimates?
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:51.420]   - I think that right now,
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.220]   bonds, notes, anything, you know,
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.540]   beyond the couple of months
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.620]   probably has a negative expected real rate of return.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.980]   You know, it can't be any other way.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.260]   I mean, if you've got, you know,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.060]   if you think that inflation over the next 10 years
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.580]   is going to be less than 1.1%,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.020]   you know, I've got a bridge that I want to sell you.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.420]   I think U.S. stocks have probably an expected-
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.060]   - I may want to buy that bridge, by the way,
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.420]   if it's paying tolls to get across.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.580]   I might be interested, so let me know afterwards.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.060]   - Okay, I'll name the bridge after we're off the call.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.380]   And, you know, I think that cash probably has a yield,
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.700]   which is not too much less than inflation,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.100]   so not too much less than zero.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.620]   And then finally, U.S. stocks may be about 3% real
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.940]   and foreign stocks may be 4% real
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.900]   and emerging markets may be a little bit more than that.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.620]   - You know, in the U.S.,
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.060]   my view of a rate of return on equities,
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.580]   and I'll use nominal instead of real,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.580]   is about 6% on equity and 2.5% on bonds.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.300]   If you're looking at corporate bonds,
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.100]   maybe you'll get three because you have 2% inflation.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.740]   I know you might be looking at lower than that,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.020]   but if you use 2% inflation,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.020]   2% real GDP per capita growth, if we get it,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.700]   and then 2% dividend yield, you put it all together,
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.420]   you just zero out any P/E multiple expansion
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.540]   and you get about a 6% return on equity.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.020]   So that's how I get to 6% on equity in the long-term.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.580]   And then the 2.5% on bonds
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.260]   is simply whatever the 10-year treasury bond is now
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.620]   plus a 10-year corporate combined together,
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.020]   you know, 50/50, you know,
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.620]   looking forward over the next 10 years,
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.500]   it's a pretty good predictor of what that return will be.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.580]   I mean, am I far off?
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.780]   - No, no, you're not.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.220]   And the trick is, no matter what estimate you give
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.700]   or I give, especially for stocks,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.860]   you have to take it with a grain of salt.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.620]   I mean, someone took me to task
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.260]   in the questions portion of your post.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.660]   You know, what they wanted to ask me was,
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.180]   how did I get stocks so wrong over the past 10 years?
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.540]   Because 10 years ago, I mean, it was 19 years ago.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.500]   Yeah, it was 19 years ago.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.820]   I predicted like 2.5% for stocks
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.740]   and they were actually 7%.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.100]   Well, you know, over 19,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:15.100]   if the standard deviation of stocks is 16% a year,
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.540]   to make life easy over 16 years,
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.700]   then the standard error is going to be 4%.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.340]   So I was a little more than one standard error off, okay?
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.660]   - But you're a doctor.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.260]   - Yeah, well, there's still, you know,
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.940]   but I still have to obey the laws of statistics.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.180]   (laughing)
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.660]   So, I mean, even over 30 years,
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.460]   I can give you a 30-year estimate,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.340]   but even over 30 years,
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.100]   I mean, the square root of 30 is like five and a half.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.300]   So one standard deviation on that estimate is 3%,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.740]   two standard deviations is 6%.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.980]   So if I say a real return of 3%,
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:54.140]   well, it could be 9% or it could be minus 3%.
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.660]   - So getting back to what you said
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.740]   about the Boglehead question,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.020]   we can go there now because we had a number of questions
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.500]   from the Boglehead's forum.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.500]   A lot of them are investing questions.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.620]   So we can get more into the nitty gritty of each asset class
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.140]   and factor investing and tips and so forth.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   Let me go ahead and go to the Boglehead forum,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.460]   and because I always post on the Boglehead forum,
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.500]   bogleheads.org, who my guest is,
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.940]   and then I ask the forum members who are registered
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.900]   to ask intelligent questions
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.700]   that are not related to them personally that I can ask.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.820]   So here we go with the first question.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.820]   So Bill, I had a number of Bogleheads asking about factors
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.900]   like value, momentum, quality,
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.060]   and you've written a lot about this
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.340]   in some very prestigious academic journals
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.420]   about factor investing.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.540]   You're well-known to have yourself
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.060]   in your client portfolios use factor type funds,
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.060]   but factors have not done well in the last, say, 10 years.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.860]   And first of all, could you comment on that
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.460]   and then comment if you can,
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.220]   if you have any thoughts about the valuation
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.500]   of various factors going forward?
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.220]   - I knew I was going to be asked this.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.620]   I went and did what any person does in that position,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.300]   which is you go and you look at the Ken French website
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.980]   and you download some data and you massage it.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.420]   The primary way you look at how-
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.660]   - No, I never do that.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.380]   I can't believe you would accuse us
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.740]   of doing things like that.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.900]   - (laughs) Well, it just shows how warped I am.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.820]   And what you do, the simplest database you can look at
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.740]   is just the global database of U.S. stocks.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.540]   And you sort purely by price to book,
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.140]   which is historically the way they've looked at value
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.660]   versus growth, or obviously other ways,
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.860]   as you well know, to do it.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.420]   They do a 30, 40, 30 sort.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.820]   So they look at the 30%
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.020]   that are the cheapest by price to book,
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.740]   the 30% of the most expensive,
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.940]   and then there's 40% in the middle.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.740]   So if you look at the price to book ratio,
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.380]   or actually the inverse of that,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.020]   the book to market ratio of the cheapest stocks
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.540]   versus the expensive stocks,
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.580]   it's always going to be much greater than one, okay?
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.260]   Because that's how you're defining it, all right?
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.380]   And it turns out that the average value
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.500]   over the past 50 years is about 4.8, okay?
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.820]   That ratio is 4.8.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.220]   So in other words, the cheapest 30%
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.020]   have a book to market value
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.180]   that is about 4.8 times the most expensive stocks,
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.420]   which is about what you'd expect, okay?
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.140]   And it turns out that when you look at what happens
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.180]   to that ratio over time,
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   it corresponds precisely to how value has done
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.780]   versus the market or value has done relative to growth,
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.020]   however you want to look at it.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.940]   So for example, if you look at the period
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.940]   from say 1995 to 2000,
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.660]   which was a terrible period for value,
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.500]   you find that ratio rising from about four
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.940]   to about almost 10, okay?
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.980]   Which was historically unprecedented.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.020]   That was the height of the bubble
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.660]   in growth stocks around 2000 or so.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.260]   And then if you look at what happened to that ratio
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.340]   over the next 10 years or so,
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.820]   you find that it went from 10 all the way down
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.540]   to about 3.8, okay?
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.860]   And those were salad days for value stocks.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.180]   You know, it was shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.060]   Everybody got excited about value stocks
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.500]   because they beat growth box stocks by several percent
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.340]   per year.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.460]   Well, what has now happened since about 2011 or so
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.220]   is that ratio has gone up from about, I don't know,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.860]   to 3.6 or 3.8, all the way up to almost six, okay?
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.980]   So what has happened to the value premium?
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   It's done very poorly, all right?
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.500]   Well, it turns out that the current value,
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   about six, is more than a bit above its historical average,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.540]   which is another way of saying that value stocks
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.020]   are now cheaper, all right?
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.820]   And I think that people are getting very discouraged
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.500]   with value investing, and that's a good sign
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.100]   because that corresponds to John Templeton's point
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.540]   of maximum pessimism.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.620]   Yes, but only when the blood is dry.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.140]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.740]   And I think the blood is drying, but it's not dry yet.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.660]   But you said something, I don't know what it was,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.540]   five or six years ago, and we were having
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.700]   the same conversation about value.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.420]   And it was too easy back then.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.660]   And you say we need blood in the street
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   in order for the true value investors to earn a return.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.500]   I was talking with Wesley Gray, I had him on as a guest,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.660]   and he's a quant from the University of Chicago,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.460]   Alpha Architect is his company.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.260]   And I had him on as a guest, and he was saying,
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.180]   the people who make money in value
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.660]   earn their value premium.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   What we have now is basically a cult of value renters,
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.980]   where we had a lot of people come in and buy value stocks
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.660]   using these newfangled ETFs.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.460]   And there was a whole lot of value investing
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.900]   for the wrong reasons, because they were trend followers,
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.300]   getting value premiums down to this 3.8, like you said,
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.340]   a lot of money going into it at the wrong time.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.420]   But now it's come back the other way.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.660]   There's blood in the street, a lot of blood in the street.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.100]   I don't know if the blood is dry yet,
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.940]   or maybe there's gonna be more blood.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.260]   But to me, I agree with you that we're getting to a point
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.060]   where, gee, it's almost safe to invest in value again.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't know if we're at that point,
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.180]   but you never know when you're at that point.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.900]   And the smart thing you do is you stay true
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.340]   to your discipline.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.700]   It was J.P. Morgan who very famously said
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.300]   that a bear market is when stocks are returned
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.660]   to their rightful owners.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.980]   - Exactly, yeah, there you go.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   - And I think the same thing is true of the value premium.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.740]   What we've had over the past five to six years
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.740]   is a lot of dentists getting sold by their broker
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.940]   on factor investing in smart data.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.540]   And you need to wash those people out
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.500]   in order to earn the value premium.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.860]   - How come you always pick on dentists?
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.260]   'Cause I remember every joke that you make.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.780]   Instead of picking on doctors, you pick on dentists.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.660]   Instead of picking on surgeons, you pick on dentists.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.180]   Is that something that in your other occupation,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.340]   some rivalry between dentists and medical doctors?
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.500]   - Yeah, it may be.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.860]   In medical specialty, in medical training,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.780]   you refer to purely procedural specialists as dentists.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.940]   It's not a compliment.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.860]   - I remember you had a joke about the Luby's,
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.740]   two dentists sitting together at Luby's
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.220]   talking about stocks and the market will never be,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.660]   or index funds will never take over the whole market
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.380]   if there are two dentists sitting together
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.340]   having lunch at Luby's trading stocks
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   or something like that.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.340]   - Very, very, very close.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:25.340]   You got the vowels and the consonants right.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.820]   What I believe I said was two dentists
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.020]   having lunch in Lubyck.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.820]   - Oh, Lubyck, oh, okay, okay.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.660]   - Yes.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.340]   - Anyway, so we can go on to another question
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.860]   that the Bogleheads have.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.860]   One of the Bogleheads asks how you feel
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.740]   about international REITs and international bonds.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.380]   There's always a lot of controversy
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.180]   about those two asset classes.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.140]   How do you feel about that?
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.180]   - Well, as far as international bonds go,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.380]   I just don't like them.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.460]   Even forgetting about the fact that most of them
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.220]   have negative yields right now.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.260]   And the reason is you have a choice
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.860]   when you're owning international bonds.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.700]   You can either not hedge them,
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.580]   in which case you've got a relatively safe bond,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.620]   a sovereign bond, but it's got overlaid on top of it
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.420]   industrial grade currency risk.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.060]   So that's not a bright idea.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.540]   Or you could hedge it back to the US dollar.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.180]   And then what you wind up when you do that
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.300]   is just a very expensive domestic bond.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.980]   So neither of those two things make sense.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.780]   Now, a long time ago, I did occasionally invest
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.740]   in foreign denominated bonds that were not hedged.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   And I did that whenever I went to Europe
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.140]   and I thought that it was cheap.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.260]   Okay, so if you were lucky enough to visit Europe,
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.980]   let's say in the early to mid 80s,
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.540]   when you had a 10 franc dollar or a British pound
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.340]   that was trading fairly close to par,
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.260]   back in the day when the pound was actually worth something.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.860]   And when those currencies had fat yields attached to them,
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.660]   yeah, that was an opportunistic play,
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.860]   but I haven't seen anything attractive in that regard
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.780]   over the past 20 years for the simple reason
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.380]   that foreign currencies have been fairly expensive
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.100]   in general over the past 20 years.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.100]   And now, with the interest rates,
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.700]   I wouldn't do it at any currency valuation
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.980]   because of the low interest rates.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.660]   So that's international bonds.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.740]   International REITs, yeah, I think it's a good way
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.660]   of diversifying a REIT portfolio
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.660]   and diversifying in general.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.560]   They're also trading at relatively attractive valuations
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.700]   relative to US REITs.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.900]   Now, that's not exactly REITs.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.260]   It's real estate where there are management companies
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.460]   and there are development companies and so forth.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.740]   - Right.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.340]   - Okay, one of the Bogleheads asks
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.700]   about the duration of your bonds.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   Should they continue to hold only short-duration bonds
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.100]   as they are getting near retirement?
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.660]   And here's the line that I think is funny.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:08.140]   That's a no-brainer in today's interest rate environment.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.580]   I remember you and I having a conversation
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.700]   about this 10 years ago.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.220]   We were on a Bogleheads panel together
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.500]   and we were talking about bonds.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.300]   Somebody asked, "Where should you have
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.620]   "the duration of your bond portfolio?"
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.200]   And I think you said 10 years ago,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.740]   "It's a no-brainer, have them in short-term."
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.760]   And I disagreed with you on that.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.840]   I said, "Well, I don't know, but I'm just gonna,
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.920]   "if your liabilities are intermediate-term,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.440]   "you should probably have intermediate-term bonds."
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.500]   So I'm gonna go back to you now.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:37.080]   Is it a no-brainer to have short-term bonds
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.000]   in your portfolio?
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.040]   - Well, I can't be right about everything.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.420]   (laughing)
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.700]   And I was certainly wrong about that,
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.560]   but I think as a general rule,
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   you wanna take your risk in stocks and not in bonds.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:59.740]   And I think that going out into intermediate-term bonds
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.580]   is too much of a risk if rates spike up.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.780]   And let's face it, there's not a lot of juice left
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.420]   in that play.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.780]   - And there's huge complexity right now in bonds.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.780]   I mean, just one little move up in interest rates
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.300]   on intermediate-term, and you're gonna have some,
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.060]   I mean, the duration have expanded
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.220]   on a five-year or a 10-year treasury bond.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.140]   Duration, because interest rates are low,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.080]   duration is a factor of the bond maturity date,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.180]   the coupon payment, and where interest rates currently are.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:33.900]   So if interest rates are 5% or 6%,
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.540]   and you had a jump of 1%,
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.820]   it wouldn't hurt the bond portfolio
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.180]   as much as it does now,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.260]   where interest rates are less than 1 1/2.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.420]   And I would say, when it comes to bond duration,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.340]   I would say two things.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.540]   And I would put two and two together and make four.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.580]   The one thing that I would say is that
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.220]   your bonds are what allow you to sleep at night, okay?
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   When everything else is going down the you-know-what,
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.220]   you wanna have something that you can look at and say,
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.540]   yes, that pays for next week's groceries
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.940]   or next month's rent or mortgage payment.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.800]   And your bonds allow you to do that.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.620]   So you don't wanna take that much risk with your bonds.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.620]   The second thing I would add on to that
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.820]   is to realize that between 1940 and 1980,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.660]   the real return of long-term U.S. treasuries,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   and that includes reinvested interest, was -60%, all right?
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.900]   And you don't want that happening to the safe assets,
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.940]   the things that are allowing you to sleep at night.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.500]   - I have friends who are in Europe
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.420]   who are investment advisors,
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.060]   and they're dealing with negative interest rates.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:50.060]   And what you said about being able to sleep at night
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.540]   by having bonds,
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.700]   that we're actually getting on the other side of that curve
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.300]   over in Europe,
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.960]   where people now are actually not sleeping at night
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.020]   because of their bond holdings and negative interest rates.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.420]   So it's, even if they're short terms,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.380]   this is an interesting phenomenon that's taking place
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.460]   in the global financial markets
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.740]   that has never taken place before.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.740]   And this is where I think we're in a new area.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.780]   If we get into negative interest rates
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.300]   like the rest of the world,
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.440]   people are not going to be looking at bonds
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.140]   as though they were sleep at night type investment.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.100]   Do you agree?
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.700]   - Yeah, now, again, I'm putting myself, let's say,
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.620]   in the position of a Northern European person
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.700]   who is spending local currency.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.700]   If I see negative interest rates, okay,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.960]   I'm also seeing something else,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.740]   which is that because of the European Union
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.540]   and because of increased immigration,
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.220]   most of the things you want to do in Europe
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.200]   have actually not gone up in price
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.060]   and may have fallen in price.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.540]   Every time I go to Europe these days,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.900]   I'm amazed at how reasonable it is.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.780]   And so the one exception to that, of course,
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.660]   is if you have to buy a house or an apartment, all right?
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.180]   But I'm assuming you already own a house and an apartment
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.140]   and all you have to do is meet your living expenses
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.320]   and you want a fixed income substitute.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.500]   Well, that's the point where I trot on down to the bank
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.420]   and I rent a great big fat safety deposit box
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.260]   and I put my cash in it, okay?
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.540]   And then I'm not getting negative interest rates.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.540]   - So one of the Bogleheads comes back and he asks,
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.860]   under what circumstances would you recommend
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.260]   going longer term on bonds?
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.300]   What would have to happen for you to go longer term?
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.500]   - Oh, I'd want to see a great big steep yield curve.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.100]   I want to be rewarded for going long
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.500]   and I want to be rewarded a lot.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.580]   - As we continue with our fixed income discussion,
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.220]   how do you feel about municipal bonds?
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.340]   A lot of people are talking about these embedded liabilities
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.820]   and the quality of municipal bonds going down,
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.340]   bankruptcies and so forth.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.180]   Where do you stand on municipal bonds?
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.500]   - Well, the thing that's always said about municipal bonds
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.620]   is that during the Great Depression,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.540]   very few of them went bankrupt,
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:12.820]   very few municipalities went bankrupt because they can tax.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.060]   But during the 1930s, as the question points out,
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.900]   municipalities didn't have these absolutely massive
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.420]   pension obligations that threatened to bankrupt them.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.020]   I think that high quality municipal bonds
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.420]   are certainly not that risky in the aggregate.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.500]   You know, if you own, say one of the Vanguard
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.420]   municipal bond funds that are so inexpensive
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.940]   that they can get the same yield as other funds do,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.060]   but at much higher quality,
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.960]   I think that you shouldn't necessarily avoid them.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.600]   But I think that less than half of your bond portfolio
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.860]   should be in munis.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.300]   And less than half of your munis should be, obviously,
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.940]   in a single-state munis.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.180]   As attractive as that may be,
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.200]   if you're in California or New York,
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.940]   you're taking too much concentrated risk
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.780]   by owning all of your munis in one state.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.260]   - One other item that you've talked about in the past
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.860]   is owning commodity-producing assets,
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.820]   like gold miners and such.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.620]   Is that still on your radar screen,
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   to buy things like the gold miners,
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.140]   and not buying gold, but commodity producers
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.340]   as a diversification hedge?
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.780]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.380]   And in fact, when you look at the data
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.860]   on how commodities producers do
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.660]   during hyperinflationary periods,
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.860]   they do extremely well.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.100]   Now, realize always that there are three things
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.740]   you have to understand about stocks and inflation.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.020]   Number one is that in the short term,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.740]   when you see unexpected inflation,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.940]   stocks do take a hit, okay?
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.640]   But in the much longer term,
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.940]   stocks are a claim on real assets.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.660]   They make products that get priced in real terms.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.620]   They own assets that get priced in real terms,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.700]   in real terms.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.040]   And when you look at how well stocks
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.140]   have done internationally
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.140]   during periods of hyperinflation,
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.780]   on average, they do very well.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.820]   I mean, the worst, well, not the worst,
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.220]   but the most famous example of hyperinflation
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.740]   was the Weimar hyperinflation
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.500]   between roughly 1920 and the end,
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.620]   the beginning of 1920 and the end of 1923.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.500]   And when you look at German stock returns
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.620]   during that period,
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.460]   they had a positive real rate of return, all right?
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.020]   And that's true, been true of any number of countries.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.140]   I mean, Israel and Chile, for example,
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.820]   during the '80s and '70s, '80s and '90s
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.580]   had extremely high inflation,
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.540]   but the real rate of return on their equities
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   was equal to that of the United States.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.060]   So that's the first thing.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.460]   And then the second thing is that
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.260]   the stocks that do particularly well
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.460]   are two kinds of stocks.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.980]   One is value stocks do well with inflation
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.780]   because their liabilities get inflated away
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.020]   and flow to their bottom line
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.860]   because value stocks tend to be more leveraged
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.580]   or indebted than growth stocks are.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.540]   But more importantly,
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:12.380]   commodities producers also do extremely well.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.860]   They don't all do well,
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.300]   but a few of them do well enough that they save your bacon.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.420]   So if you invest, for example, in base metals equities
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.260]   and oil stocks and gold stocks,
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.140]   one of those three is going to do well enough
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.860]   that your bacon is going to get saved.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.060]   Now, how much of your portfolio
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.860]   do you devote to that sort of thing?
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.780]   Not very much, just enough to take the pain,
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.060]   you know, take the edge off of the pain.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.740]   You know, if you have a horrible financial crisis
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.180]   and gold stocks do well,
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.140]   instead of your portfolio losing 30%,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.100]   maybe it only loses 25%.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.900]   - Isn't there a lot of overlap between value investing
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:50.500]   and commodities like oil producers and such?
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.140]   They tend to show up in a lot of value indexes.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.300]   - That's true, gold stocks don't though.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.580]   - Bill, you've always been a wonderful guest
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.340]   at the Bogleheads conferences.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   When you go, you generously give your time
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.100]   to answering questions.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.940]   And if I could just get you to comment
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.860]   about the Bogleheads
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.420]   and where do you see everything going
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.380]   now that Jack, unfortunately, has passed away?
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.540]   - Well, you know, let me make a general statement
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.580]   about the Bogleheads,
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.420]   which is that you will not encounter a group
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.540]   of even, you know, small investors
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.060]   or institutional investors who are more sophisticated,
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.740]   you know, who understand stochastics,
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.620]   who understand portfolio theory,
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.460]   who understand efficient markets,
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.700]   and, you know, who are smart enough
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.460]   not to be distracted by the news.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.940]   It's almost an alternative universe.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.580]   It's almost like you're on a different investment planet
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.220]   and it's a very nice place to be.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:50.580]   The conference this year filled up very slightly slower
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.060]   instead of filling up inside of six hours.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.340]   It sold out inside of like less than a day, I think.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.940]   Maybe even better.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.100]   So I think it's going to do just fine.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.300]   I think that, you know, we're all going to miss Jack,
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.980]   but obviously there's a lot, you know,
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.420]   there are a lot more reasons why people come
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.060]   to the Bogleheads than to hear Jack talk.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.860]   He's as great as his talks were.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.180]   - You know, we continue to march.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.140]   We have to continue to spread the word.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.300]   We had the person who was holding the flame
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.740]   and now here we are, if you don't mind me dating myself,
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.460]   we, with our Bick Lighters, have to follow.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.580]   That's what it's all about.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.380]   - I thought you were going to say Zippo Lighters,
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.220]   but all right.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.980]   (laughs)
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:34.740]   - That's a Bick, I'm in a Bick Lighter, if I recall.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.860]   But I know what, yeah, Zippo is a little bit,
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.140]   it actually predates me.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.900]   There, it shows the age between you and I.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:41.740]   So there you go.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.540]   (laughs)
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.700]   Listen, Bill, thank you so much for being our guest
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.980]   on the Bogleheads.
