[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.060]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.860]   Today, we're discussing depression.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.400]   In particular, we're going to talk about major depression.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.240]   The phrase major depression is used to distinguish
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420]   one form of depression from the other,
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.720]   the other one being bipolar depression.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040]   Major depression impacts 5% of the population.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.140]   That is an enormous number.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.220]   That means if you're in a class of 100 people,
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.220]   five of them are dealing with major depression
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.800]   or have at some point.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000]   Look around you in any environment,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.060]   and you can be sure that a good portion of the people
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.320]   that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.780]   or will be at some point.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.620]   So this is something we really have to take seriously
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.880]   and that we want to understand.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.380]   It is the number four cause of disability.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.900]   A lot of people miss work, miss school,
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   and before then likely perform poorly in work or school
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.500]   due to major depression.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.400]   So let's talk about the things that are present
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100]   in somebody that has major depression.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.220]   First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.580]   There tends to be a lot of sadness.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.540]   That's no surprise.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.500]   There's also this thing that we call anhedonia,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.240]   a general lack of ability to enjoy things.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260]   For the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.520]   this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.700]   a kind of a flat affect as it's called.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.720]   Sometimes even delusional thinking,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.740]   negative delusional thinking,
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.540]   and in particular, anti-self confabulation.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.360]   What is anti-self confabulation?
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.700]   Well, first of all, confabulation is an incredible aspect
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.380]   of our mind and our nervous system.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.640]   You sometimes see other forms of confabulation
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.080]   in people who have memory deficits,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.580]   either because they have brain damage
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.360]   or they have age-related dementia.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.300]   A good example of this would be
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.220]   someone with age-related dementia
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.060]   sometimes will find themselves
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.000]   in a location in the house
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180]   and not know how they got there.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.420]   And if you ask them,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.760]   oh, what are you doing here?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.980]   They will create these elaborate stories.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.120]   Oh, you know, I was thinking about
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.560]   going to the shopping today
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.800]   and I was, you know,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   and I was going to take the bus
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.400]   and then I was going to do,
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.120]   they create these elaborate stories.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.000]   They confabulate.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.240]   It's as if a brain circuit that writes stories
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.400]   just starts generating content.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.600]   In major depression,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.780]   there's often a state of delusional
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.460]   anti-self confabulation
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.760]   where the confabulations are not directly
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.440]   or completely linked to reality,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.760]   but they are ones that make the self,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.080]   the person describing them,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520]   seem sick or in some way not well.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.980]   A good example would be somebody
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.080]   who experiences a physical injury, perhaps.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.640]   Maybe they break their ankle,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.540]   maybe it's an athlete,
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.480]   and they also happen to become depressed.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.900]   And you'll talk to them,
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.860]   you say, how are things going?
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.480]   How's your rehab?
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.500]   And they're like, oh, it's okay.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.540]   And I don't know,
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.960]   I'm just, I feel like I'm getting weaker
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.080]   and weaker by the day.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600]   I'm just not performing well.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.520]   And then you'll talk to the person
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.780]   that they're working with,
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.520]   their kinesiologist or whoever
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.960]   the physical therapist is,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.640]   and they'll say, no,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.800]   they're actually really improving.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.920]   And I tell them they're improving,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.840]   but somehow they're not,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.580]   they're not seeing that improvement.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.140]   They're not registering that improvement.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.760]   They are viewing themselves
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.140]   and they are confabulating
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.320]   according to a view
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.000]   that is very self-deprecating
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.080]   to the point where
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.960]   it doesn't match up with reality.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.720]   The other common symptomology
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.520]   of major depression
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.120]   is what they call vegetative symptoms.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.780]   Okay.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.380]   So vegetative symptoms
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.100]   are symptoms that occur
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.540]   without any thinking,
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.100]   without any doing,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.480]   or without any confabulation.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   These are things
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.600]   that are related
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   to our core physiology,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.620]   things like constantly being exhausted.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.340]   The person just feels exhausted.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.860]   They don't have the energy
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.760]   they once had.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.260]   So it's not in their heads.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.320]   Something is disrupted
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.340]   in the autonomic
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.340]   or so-called vegetative nervous system.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.800]   And one of the most common symptoms
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.900]   of people with major depression,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.960]   one of the signs of major depression
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.560]   is early waking
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.120]   and not being able
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   to fall back asleep
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.900]   despite being exhausted.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.260]   So waking up at 3 a.m.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.120]   or 4 a.m.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.880]   or 5 a.m.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.840]   just spontaneously
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.700]   and not being able
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.520]   to go back to sleep.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.600]   It's well known
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.760]   that the architecture of sleep
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.740]   is disrupted in depression.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.560]   What's the architecture of sleep?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.900]   Early in the night,
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.140]   you tend to have slow-wave sleep
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.160]   more than REM sleep
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   or rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.360]   As the night goes on,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.000]   you tend to have more
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.220]   rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.680]   That architecture
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.220]   of slow-wave sleep
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.540]   preceding rapid eye movement sleep
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.260]   is radically disrupted
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.660]   in major depression.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.200]   In addition,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.340]   the pattern of activity
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.940]   in the brain
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.860]   during particular phases of sleep
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.460]   is disrupted.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.220]   And then there are some other things
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.820]   that relate
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.280]   to the autonomic nervous system,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.860]   but that we normally think of
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.480]   as more voluntary in nature.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.660]   And these are things
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.900]   like decreased appetite.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.160]   So you could imagine
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.120]   that one could have decreased appetite
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.620]   because of the anhedonia,
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.400]   the lack of pleasure from food.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.140]   So you can see
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.120]   that the symptomology
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.080]   of major depression
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.380]   impacts us at multiple levels.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.700]   There's the conscious level
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.200]   of how excited we are generally.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.780]   Well, that's reduced.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.840]   There's grief,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.560]   there's guilt,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.860]   there's crying,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.080]   but then there's also
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.380]   these vegetative things.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.640]   There's disruptions in sleep,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.780]   which of course make everything
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.580]   more challenging
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.320]   when we're awake.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.040]   We know that.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.880]   Sleep is so vital
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.640]   for resetting.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.780]   You're waking up early,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.700]   you can't get back to sleep.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.080]   That's going to adjust
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.560]   your affect,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.200]   your emotions
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.100]   in negative ways.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.800]   We know this.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.660]   And appetite is off.
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.360]   And there are hormones
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.140]   that get disrupted.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.800]   So cortisol levels
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.400]   are increased.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.920]   In particular,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.300]   there's a signature pattern
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.040]   of depression
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.020]   whereby cortisol,
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.020]   this stress hormone
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.420]   that normally is released
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.400]   in a healthy way
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.780]   only in the early part
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.380]   of the day
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.380]   is shifted
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.120]   to late in the day.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.880]   In fact,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.320]   a 9 p.m. peak
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   in cortisol
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.260]   is one of the
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.040]   physiological signatures
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.560]   of depressive-like states.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.580]   It's not the only one,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.500]   but it is an important one.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.600]   So let's just take
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.140]   a few minutes
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.320]   and talk about
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.780]   some of the underlying biology
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.400]   that creates
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.920]   this cloud
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.900]   or this constellation
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.120]   of symptomology.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.400]   One of the most important
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.420]   early findings
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.980]   in the search
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.720]   for a biological basis
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.340]   of depression
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.240]   was this finding
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.800]   that there are drugs
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.200]   that relieve
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.020]   some of the symptoms
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.640]   of depression.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.600]   Those drugs
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.660]   generally fall
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.480]   into three major categories,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.740]   but the first set
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.120]   of ones
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.840]   that were discovered
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.060]   were the so-called
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.020]   tricyclic antidepressants
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.020]   and the MAO inhibitors,
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.300]   the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.000]   And these tricyclic antidepressants
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.880]   and the MAO inhibitors
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.120]   largely worked
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.940]   by increasing levels
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.520]   of norepinephrine
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.480]   in the brain
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.600]   as well as in the body
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.380]   in some cases.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.640]   They were discovered
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.240]   because of the exploration
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   for drugs
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.920]   that alter blood pressure.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.120]   Norepinephrine impacts
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   blood pressure
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.380]   and drugs
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.120]   that lower
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   blood pressure,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.680]   reduce levels
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.540]   of norepinephrine,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.500]   and that
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.680]   in many cases
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.080]   was shown
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.980]   to lead to
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.700]   depression
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.780]   or depressive-like
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.360]   symptoms.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.100]   These tricyclic drugs
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.440]   and the MAO inhibitors
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.080]   actually increase
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.800]   norepinephrine
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.020]   and frankly,
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.660]   they do
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.720]   quite a good job
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.560]   of relieving
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.260]   some,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.940]   if not all,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.620]   of the symptoms
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.900]   of major depression.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.300]   However,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.200]   they carry with them
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.300]   many side effects.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.680]   Some of those side effects
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.020]   are side effects
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.980]   related to blood pressure
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.380]   itself.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.060]   By increasing
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.060]   noradrenaline,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.640]   norepinephrine
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.220]   as it's called,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.360]   you raise blood pressure.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   That can be dangerous.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.900]   But they also have
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.580]   a lot of other side effects.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.020]   The reason they have
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.800]   other side effects
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.040]   is because they impact
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.120]   systems in the brain
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.100]   and in the body
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.300]   that impact things
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.280]   like libido,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.540]   appetite,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.680]   digestion,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   and others.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.560]   They made some people
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.200]   so uncomfortable
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.980]   that they preferred
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.800]   not to take them
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.340]   even though
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.360]   when they didn't
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.700]   take them,
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.900]   they had a worsening
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.440]   or a maintenance
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.640]   of their depressive symptoms.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   A decade or so later,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.540]   there was the discovery
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.440]   of the so-called
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.320]   pleasure pathways
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   in the brain.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.840]   This pleasure pathway
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.220]   as it's sometimes called
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.080]   involves areas
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.480]   like the nucleus accumbens
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.060]   and the ventral tegmental area.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.180]   These are areas
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.720]   of the brain
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.380]   that are rich
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.000]   with neurons
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.080]   that make dopamine.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.580]   And if you think
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.380]   to the symptoms
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.260]   of depression,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.300]   of anhedonia,
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.160]   lack of pleasure,
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.140]   a lack of ability
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.300]   to experience pleasure,
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.100]   well,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.820]   that was a smoking gun
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.860]   that there's something wrong
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.940]   with the dopamine pathway
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.440]   in depression.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.000]   So it's not just norepinephrine,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.320]   it's also the dopamine
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.340]   or pleasure pathway
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.360]   is somehow disrupted.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.220]   And then in the 1980s,
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.060]   there was the discovery
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.860]   of the so-called SSRIs.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860]   Most people are now familiar
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.120]   with the SSRIs,
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.420]   the selective serotonin
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.780]   reuptake inhibitors.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.940]   The SSRIs worked
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.320]   by distinct mechanisms
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.280]   from the tricyclic antidepressants
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.440]   and the MAO inhibitors.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.900]   As their name suggests,
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   SSRI,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.100]   selective serotonin
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.020]   reuptake inhibitors,
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.400]   prevent serotonin
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.800]   from being wiped up
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.040]   from the synapse
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.400]   after two neurons
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.160]   talk to one another.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.040]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.280]   Well,
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.740]   here's some very basic
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.620]   neurobiology 101.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.260]   If you don't know
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.100]   any neurobiology,
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.920]   you're going to know
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.820]   some in about 15 seconds.
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.180]   Neurons communicate
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.860]   with one another
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.280]   by spitting out chemicals
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   into the little gap
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.180]   between them.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.340]   The little gap between them
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.340]   is called the synapse.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.320]   Those chemicals
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.880]   bind to the neuron
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.940]   on the opposite side
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.220]   and cause changes
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.380]   in the electrical activity
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.140]   of that neuron
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.140]   on the other side
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.740]   of the synapse.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.920]   Serotonin is one
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.320]   such neurotransmitter
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.340]   or more specifically,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.960]   it's a neuromodulator.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.060]   It can change the activity
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.520]   of large groups of neurons
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.980]   in very meaningful ways.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.620]   Selective serotonin
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.700]   reuptake inhibitor
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.500]   means when a person
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.740]   takes this drug,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.040]   some of those drugs
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.700]   include things like
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.100]   Prozac or Zoloft.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.320]   The more typical names
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.620]   or more generic names
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.900]   are things like fluoxetine.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.740]   When people take those,
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.080]   more serotonin
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   hangs out in the synapse
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.380]   and is able to be taken up
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.080]   by the neuron
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.320]   on the opposite side
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.840]   because of this selective
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.340]   reuptake inhibition.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.140]   It prevents the clearance
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.040]   of serotonin
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.740]   from the synapse
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   and thereby more serotonin
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.600]   can have an effect.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.920]   So SSRIs
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   don't increase
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.880]   the total amount
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.520]   of serotonin
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.040]   in the brain.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.300]   They change
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.400]   how effective
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.600]   the serotonin
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.240]   that's already
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:34.820]   in the brain
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.360]   is at changing
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.060]   the activity
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.580]   of neurons.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.960]   About a third
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.420]   of people
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.780]   that take SSRIs
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.160]   don't derive
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   any benefit.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.900]   It doesn't relieve
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.380]   their symptoms
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.980]   of depression.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.680]   However,
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.820]   for the other two-thirds,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.220]   there's often a relief
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.860]   of some,
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.500]   if not all,
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.980]   of the symptoms
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.860]   of major depression.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.020]   the problem
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.060]   is the side effects
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.940]   that accompany
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.220]   those SSRIs.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.740]   And so these days,
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.680]   SSRIs are a complicated topic.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.620]   It's sort of what I would call
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.720]   a barbed wire topic,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.900]   but these drugs also
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.060]   have saved a lot of lives.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.400]   They've also improved
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.180]   a lot of lives.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.300]   The issue
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.220]   is that they tend
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.280]   to have varying effects
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.400]   on different individuals
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.700]   and sometimes varying effects
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.480]   over time.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.040]   So they'll work for a while,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.140]   then they won't work for a while.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.760]   There are also a lot
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.380]   of mysteries
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.960]   about the SSRIs
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   and those mysteries
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.880]   bother people.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.260]   SSRIs increase
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.480]   the amount of serotonin
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   or more specifically,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.560]   they increase
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.100]   the efficacy
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.940]   of serotonin
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.680]   at the synapse.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.780]   That happens immediately
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.080]   or very soon
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.740]   after people start
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.820]   taking SSRIs,
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.020]   but people generally
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.120]   don't start experiencing
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.800]   any relief
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.640]   from their symptoms
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.260]   of depression
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.100]   if they're going
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.660]   to experience them
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.060]   at all
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.260]   until about two weeks
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:42.940]   after they start
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.820]   taking these drugs.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.700]   So it's very clear
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.400]   that there are
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.560]   at least three
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.780]   major chemical systems
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.360]   in the brain,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.200]   norepinephrine,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.680]   dopamine,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   and serotonin
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.600]   that relate to
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.780]   and can adjust
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.460]   the symptoms
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.320]   of depression.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.440]   And those actually
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.280]   can be divided
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.880]   into separate categories.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.600]   So for instance,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.400]   epinephrine
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.700]   or norepinephrine
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.800]   is thought to relate
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.520]   to the so-called
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.060]   psychomotor defects.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.140]   This is the lethargy.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.520]   This is the exhaustion.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.600]   This is the inability
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.360]   to get out of bed
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.840]   in the morning.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.140]   Dopamine
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.200]   is thought to relate
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.180]   to the anhedonia
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.680]   or I should say
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   lack of dopamine
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.480]   in depressive patients
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.220]   is thought to lead
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.680]   to the anhedonia,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.780]   the lack of ability
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.140]   to experience pleasure.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.640]   And serotonin
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.680]   is thought to relate
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.920]   to the grief,
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.720]   the guilt,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.160]   some of the more cognitive
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.060]   or more emotional aspects
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.160]   of depression.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   So we've got
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.300]   the norepinephrine system
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.600]   related to activity
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.260]   and alertness,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.400]   the dopamine system
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   relating to motivation,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   pleasure,
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.160]   and the ability
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.680]   to seek
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.820]   and experience pleasure
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.700]   and then the serotonin system
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.440]   that's related to grief.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.800]   And unfortunately,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.280]   brains and organisms
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.020]   don't work
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.380]   in a simple mathematical way
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.040]   where you just say,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.420]   oh, well,
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.400]   this person's experiencing
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.080]   a lot of grief,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.880]   but they don't have
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.900]   any problems with,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.980]   you know,
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.740]   lethargy.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.000]   And so let's just boost
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.840]   up their serotonin.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.420]   On paper,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:02.840]   it works,
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.420]   but oftentimes
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.760]   it doesn't work clinically.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.920]   A really good psychiatrist
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.680]   will work with someone
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.880]   to try and pull
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.280]   and push
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.180]   on these various systems
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.140]   to find the combination
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.320]   of drugs
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.040]   that may be
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.900]   or may not be
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.760]   correct for them.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.620]   So next,
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.160]   I'd like to talk
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.800]   about hormones
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.600]   and how they relate
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.140]   to depression.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.840]   And I'd also like
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.780]   to talk about stress
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.600]   and how it relates
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.140]   to depression,
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.120]   as well as talk
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.260]   about some of the genetics
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.700]   or the predispositions
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.120]   to depression.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.020]   20% of people
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.140]   that have major depression
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.020]   have low thyroid hormone.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.400]   And that leads
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.420]   to low energy,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.700]   low metabolism
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.540]   in the brain
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.280]   and body.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.000]   Sometimes a psychiatrist
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.060]   will prescribe
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.200]   thyroid medication
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.840]   to increase thyroid output
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.320]   in people
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.040]   that are depressed
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.720]   and that will work
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.620]   to relieve the symptoms.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.780]   So there are certain
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.100]   situations or conditions
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.360]   that can impact
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.960]   the thyroid hormone system
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.300]   and make people
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.160]   more susceptible
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.960]   to depression
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.080]   or make a pre-existing
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.040]   depression worse.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.340]   And those are things
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.500]   like childbirth.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.580]   So it's well known
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.600]   that women who give birth
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.760]   can often undergo
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.180]   what's called
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.320]   postpartum depression
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.000]   and that's thought
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.280]   to be hormonally related
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.040]   either directly
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.240]   to the thyroid system
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.960]   or perhaps
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.020]   to the cortisol system
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.300]   as well.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.100]   We'll talk about cortisol
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.620]   in a moment.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.480]   As well,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.500]   certain women
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.460]   during certain phases
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.440]   of their menstrual cycle
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.400]   experience symptoms
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.380]   that are very much
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.240]   like clinical depression
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.080]   and oftentimes
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.240]   are diagnosed
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.100]   with clinical depression
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.640]   appropriately.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   And of course,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.700]   the menstrual cycle
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.200]   is associated
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.660]   with shifts
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.460]   in hormone levels.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.980]   As well,
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.500]   menopause
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.880]   and postmenopausal
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.740]   women
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.020]   are more susceptible
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.840]   to major depression
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.760]   regardless of whether
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.340]   or not they've had
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.040]   that major depression
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.940]   earlier in their life.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.540]   So these are things
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.600]   to be on the lookout for
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.420]   and to definitely
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.280]   talk to a doctor
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.480]   and get a blood panel
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.660]   that hopefully includes
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.000]   measures of thyroid hormone
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.180]   and cortisol hormone.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.240]   Why cortisol hormone?
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.740]   Well,
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.180]   more stress
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:47.800]   is correlated
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.660]   with more bouts
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.580]   of major depression
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.540]   across the lifespan.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.200]   How many bouts?
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.540]   Well,
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.900]   it turns out
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.020]   that as you go
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.920]   from having one
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.340]   to two
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:56.820]   to three,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.160]   well,
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.840]   when you hit
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.020]   four to five bouts
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.260]   of really intense
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.580]   to stressful episodes
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.120]   in life,
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.960]   these tend to be
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.520]   long-term stressful episodes,
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.340]   your risk
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.380]   for major depression
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.600]   goes way up.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.480]   And that's because
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.460]   the stress system
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:09.980]   is associated
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.480]   with the release
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.100]   of cortisol.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.420]   The cortisol system
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.960]   can dramatically impact
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.240]   the way
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.940]   that these different
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.040]   neuromodulators,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.480]   dopamine,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.100]   norepinephrine,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.160]   and serotonin function.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.720]   One of the more
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.500]   important reasons
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.160]   for learning
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.180]   how to counter stress
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.160]   in order to offset
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.380]   depression
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.880]   is that there is
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.380]   a genetic predisposition
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.240]   that certain people
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.620]   carry to become depressed.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.600]   How do we know?
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.000]   Well,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.100]   in what are called
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.860]   concordant monozygotic twins.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.720]   So these would be
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   identical twins
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.940]   for which one
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.460]   of those twins
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.160]   goes on to have
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.820]   major depression.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.280]   There's a 50% probability
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.200]   that the other one
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.380]   will have major depression.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.540]   So it's not 100%.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.440]   It's not 100% inherited.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.340]   It's not 100% genetic,
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.420]   as you might say,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.620]   but there's a much
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.800]   higher predisposition
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.940]   for depression.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.920]   Whereas in fraternal twins
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.100]   that number drops
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.200]   and in siblings
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.920]   that number drops
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.180]   to about 25%
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.640]   and in half siblings
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.120]   it's about 10%.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.680]   Basically,
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.800]   the more closely related
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.780]   you are to somebody
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.420]   who has major depression,
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.100]   the more likely it is
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.720]   that you will also
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.500]   get major depression.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.140]   And therefore,
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.420]   if you haven't gotten
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.060]   major depression,
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.340]   the more likely it is
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:15.980]   that you should
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.580]   take steps
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.660]   to learn
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.680]   to mitigate stress
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.300]   because stress
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.120]   is the major factor
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.780]   that can trigger
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.220]   one of these
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.180]   depressive episodes.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.140]   So next,
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:24.740]   I'd like to talk
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.720]   about some of the tools
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.240]   that people
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.260]   who both have depression
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.620]   or who are prone
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.100]   to depression
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.680]   as well as people
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.500]   who don't have depression
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.160]   and simply want
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.060]   to maintain a good mood,
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.840]   who want to maintain
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.740]   a positive affect
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.080]   and pursuit of things in life.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.040]   What are the things
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.600]   that you can do?
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.900]   Any behavioral tool
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.420]   that adjusts the levels
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.360]   of a particular chemical
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.980]   ought to perhaps
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.200]   provide some relief
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.180]   for some of the symptoms
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:46.960]   of major depression.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.280]   Let's take an example
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.000]   that I've talked about
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.900]   before on the podcast,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.820]   which is if you get
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.880]   into a very cold shower,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.940]   you take an ice bath,
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.280]   you will release
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.000]   norepinephrine
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.640]   and epinephrine
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.680]   in your brain and body.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.380]   There's no question
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:58.980]   about that.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.000]   If some aspects
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.520]   of depression
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.960]   are related to low levels
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.760]   of norepinephrine,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.320]   will taking cold showers
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.660]   relieve your depression?
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.880]   Perhaps it might even
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.800]   relieve certain aspects
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.540]   of that depression.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.740]   Will exercise help?
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.520]   Well, if you go out
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.160]   for a run,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.560]   you're going to increase
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.600]   the amount of norepinephrine
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.200]   in your body.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.560]   If you enjoy that run,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.660]   it's likely that you'll
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.540]   increase the levels
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.460]   of dopamine
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.660]   and probably serotonin
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.380]   in your brain
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.180]   and body as well.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.220]   Will that cure
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:25.680]   your depression?
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.600]   Well, there are a lot
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   of studies exploring
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.620]   how exercise
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.720]   can impact depression
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.220]   and indeed,
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.200]   regular exercise
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.700]   is known to be
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.460]   a protective behavior
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.520]   against depression,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.980]   but it also can help
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.840]   relieve some of the symptoms
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.440]   of depression.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.240]   So you may ask yourself,
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.260]   why would you need drugs
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.660]   at all?
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.020]   Why would there be
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.940]   prescription drugs
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.840]   or the need
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.740]   for supplementation
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.340]   or other things
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.480]   to alleviate the symptoms
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.100]   of depression?
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   Ah, well,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.480]   that's the diabolical
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.360]   nature of depression,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.400]   which is if people
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.780]   are far enough along
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.540]   in this thing,
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.800]   this sometimes called
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.140]   disease,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.160]   sometimes called disorder,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.600]   but major depression,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.780]   oftentimes they can't
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.040]   get the energy
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.260]   to even get up
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.360]   and take a bath
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.140]   or a shower.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.820]   They have no motivation
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:10.360]   to do it.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.060]   They have no desire
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.920]   to go for a run,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.980]   but it's very important
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.780]   to highlight the fact
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.640]   that these circuits
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.120]   that are accessible
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.220]   to some of us,
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.520]   the circuits for happiness,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.660]   for pursuit of pleasure,
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.360]   for exercise,
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.680]   for getting in a cold shower,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.520]   if that's your thing,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.320]   that those circuits
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.860]   are present in all people,
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.820]   but for certain people
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.640]   that are experiencing
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.420]   major depression
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:33.920]   and are really
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.360]   in the depths
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.660]   of their depression,
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.540]   they can't really access
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.140]   those circuits
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.960]   in the same way
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.420]   that people
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.740]   who are not suffering
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.040]   from depression can.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.880]   but let's look
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.340]   at depression
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.160]   from the standpoint
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.300]   of a deeper
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.380]   biological phenomenon,
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.980]   which is inflammation
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.180]   and the immune system.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.160]   There's growing evidence now
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.420]   that many forms
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.300]   of major depression,
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.540]   if not all of them,
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.020]   relate to
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.060]   excessive inflammation.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:18:59.880]   Now,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.740]   inflammation plays
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.440]   an important role
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.160]   in wound healing
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.100]   is that it is
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.260]   a positive aspect
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.680]   of our immune system,
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.180]   our ability
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.120]   to combat
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.180]   wounds,
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.240]   combat illnesses,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.880]   et cetera,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.340]   but inflammation
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.700]   gone unchecked,
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.200]   inflammation
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.320]   that lasts too long
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.860]   or is of too high amplitude,
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.060]   meaning too many cytokines
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.800]   and things of that sort
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.200]   in the body
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.180]   is bad.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.880]   And there's decent evidence
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.600]   now that inflammation
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.340]   can lead to
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.740]   or exacerbate depression
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.820]   and that if we want
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.960]   to control depression
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.740]   or limit
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.860]   or eliminate depression,
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.160]   that focusing
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.580]   on reducing inflammation
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.060]   and its associated pathways
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.560]   is a really good thing to do.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.120]   And I think
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.400]   this is a really good thing
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.700]   for everybody to do
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.780]   regardless of whether or not
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.000]   you suffer from depression
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.460]   or not.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:44.980]   Okay.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.300]   So first of all,
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.700]   who are the major players
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.540]   in creating
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.720]   chronic inflammation
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.600]   in the brain and body?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.920]   They are the inflammatory cytokines,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.000]   things like IL-6,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.820]   interleukin-6,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.240]   things like tumor necrosis alpha,
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.820]   TNF alpha,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.200]   things like C-reactive protein.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.100]   All right.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.620]   When we are stressed,
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.660]   chronically stressed,
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.520]   we get inflamed,
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.200]   our brain
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.240]   and various locations
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:10.680]   in the brain
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.460]   become inflamed
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.360]   because certain classes
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:12.780]   of cells,
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.240]   in particular,
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.420]   those glial cells,
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.860]   the cells that are
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.820]   typically thought
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.920]   to just be support cells,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.000]   those cells
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.060]   and their biochemistry
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.860]   and their dialogue
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.740]   with the neurons
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.680]   of the brain and body
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.020]   starts to become disrupted.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.500]   It turns out
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.420]   there is a set of actions
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.940]   that we can take
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.640]   in order to limit inflammation.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.400]   One of those approaches
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.580]   is to increase
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.220]   our intake
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.540]   intake of so-called EPAs
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.840]   or essential fatty acids.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.480]   Increasing our intake
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.000]   of these essential fatty acids,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.700]   in particular,
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.480]   the EPA
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.060]   variety of omega-3s
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.160]   can lower
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.520]   the effective dose
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.820]   of things like SSRIs.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.020]   The threshold level
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.060]   seems to be
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.120]   about one gram,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.000]   a thousand milligrams
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.860]   of EPA.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.600]   So you will sometimes
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.680]   see on a bottle
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.460]   of krill oil
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.280]   or fish oil
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.340]   or any other source,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.260]   even, you know,
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.140]   plant source
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.780]   or other source
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.940]   of EPA
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.900]   that it's a thousand milligrams
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.120]   or 1,200 milligrams.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.480]   But what's really important
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.320]   to look at
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.380]   is whether or not
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.980]   there's more
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.440]   than a thousand milligrams
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.340]   of EPA
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.700]   because the EPA
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.240]   in particular
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.280]   is what's important here.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.700]   So how would this work?
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.400]   These inflammatory cytokines
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.600]   act in a variety
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.700]   of different ways,
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.820]   but they mainly act
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.940]   to inhibit the release
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.720]   of serotonin,
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.340]   norepinephrine,
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:27.880]   and dopamine
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.640]   or the synthesis
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.400]   of serotonin,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.000]   norepinephrine,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.560]   and dopamine.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.560]   Dopamine,
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.040]   also called 5-HT,
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.460]   essentially derives
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.740]   from a precursor
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.840]   called tryptophan.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.660]   Tryptophan arrives
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.740]   into our system
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.760]   through our diet,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.460]   okay?
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.920]   Tryptophan is an amino acid.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.720]   Tryptophan is eventually
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.200]   converted into serotonin.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.020]   However,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.940]   if there's excessive amounts
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.620]   of inflammation,
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.720]   these inflammatory cytokines
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.460]   cause tryptophan
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.400]   to be diverted
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.620]   down a different pathway.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.160]   The pathway involves
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.220]   something called IDO,
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.880]   idolamine,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   which converts tryptophan
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.340]   into kynurine.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.380]   Kynurine actually acts
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.440]   as a neurotoxin
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.840]   by way of converting
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.800]   into something called
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.320]   quinolinic acid,
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.900]   okay?
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.260]   And quinolinic acid
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.120]   is pro-depressive.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.060]   So if that seems like
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.520]   a complicated
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.540]   biochemical pathway,
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.980]   what's basically happening here
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.040]   is that the tryptophan
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.540]   that normally
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.320]   would be made
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.140]   into serotonin
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.340]   under conditions
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:24.940]   of inflammation
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.820]   is being diverted
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.640]   into a neurotoxic pathway.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.780]   And ingestion
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.740]   of EPAs,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.020]   because it limits
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.000]   these inflammatory cytokines,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.980]   things like IL-6,
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.960]   C-reactive protein,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.460]   et cetera,
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.060]   can cause
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.020]   more of the tryptophan
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.740]   that one ingests
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   or has in their body
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.720]   to be diverted
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.400]   towards the serotonergic pathway.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.380]   Exercise,
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.320]   it turns out,
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.720]   also has a positive effect
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.020]   on the tryptophan
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.000]   to serotonin
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   conversion pathway.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.860]   The activation
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.780]   of the muscles
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.040]   through rhythmic
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.680]   repeated use,
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.080]   in particular,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.900]   aerobic exercise,
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.920]   but also resistance
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.380]   training has been shown
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:01.760]   to do this
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.420]   to some extent,
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   tends to sequester
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.540]   or shuttle
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.880]   the kynurine
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.820]   into the muscle
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.960]   so that it isn't
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.380]   converted
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.840]   into this neurotoxin
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.540]   that is
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.900]   pro-depression.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.080]   From the data
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.680]   that are published
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.040]   in quality peer-reviewed journals,
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:16.720]   it really appears
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.940]   that this inflammation pathway
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.660]   does function
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.920]   to increase depression
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.340]   through these pathways.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.260]   And so knowing
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.580]   that there are behavioral steps
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.220]   and supplementation-based steps,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.140]   or if you prefer
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.160]   getting your EPAs
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.480]   from typical food,
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.980]   from nutritional approaches,
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.360]   I find that
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.620]   very reassuring
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.700]   that the mechanisms
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.520]   all converge
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.500]   on a common pathway,
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.240]   serotonin.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.220]   There's a common
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.300]   biochemical pathway
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.080]   that can explain
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.120]   why these things
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.260]   not just work,
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.840]   but why they should work.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.820]   They should work
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.680]   because they operate
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.460]   in the very same
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.580]   biochemical pathways
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.480]   that antidepressants
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.120]   that are prescribed
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.740]   to people do.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.220]   Now I want to talk
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.320]   about something
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.520]   that at least for me
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.560]   was quite surprising
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.380]   when I first learned
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:57.900]   about it
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.320]   for sake of
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.180]   treatment of mood disorders,
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.380]   and that's creatine.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.960]   Creatine has
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.300]   a number of very important
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.580]   functions throughout the body.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.900]   For those of you
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.700]   that are into
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.640]   resistance training,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.060]   and actually
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.620]   for those of you
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.740]   that are into
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.700]   endurance training as well,
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.980]   creatine has achieved
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.940]   a lot of popularity
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.880]   in recent years
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.560]   because supplementation
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.300]   with creatine
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.800]   can draw more water
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.500]   into muscles
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.260]   and can increase
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.040]   power output
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.920]   from muscles.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.480]   However,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.900]   there's also a
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.200]   so-called phosphocreatine
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.360]   system in the brain,
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.840]   and that phosphocreatine
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.420]   system has everything
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.360]   to do with the dialogue
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.260]   between neurons
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.700]   and these other cell types
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.460]   called glia,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.520]   but the phosphocreatine
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.020]   system
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.860]   in the forebrain
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.480]   in particular,
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.360]   in the front of our brain,
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   has been shown
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.260]   to be involved
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.920]   in regulation
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.680]   of mood
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.220]   and some of the
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.020]   reward pathways
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.860]   as well as in
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.540]   depression.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.960]   The American Journal
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.720]   of Psychiatry
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.540]   in 2012
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.600]   published a study
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.020]   which was a randomized
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.320]   double-blind placebo-controlled
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.620]   trial of oral creatine
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.260]   monohydrate,
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.740]   and what it found
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.520]   is that it could
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.960]   augment or enhance
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.620]   the response
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.260]   to a selective
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.320]   serotonin reuptake
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.800]   inhibitor,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.940]   in particular in women
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.980]   with major depressive
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.440]   disorder.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.560]   So like EPA,
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.420]   creatine supplementation
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.600]   seems to either
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.660]   lower the required
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.220]   dose of SSRI
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.840]   that's required
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.740]   to treat depression
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.280]   or can improve
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.400]   the effectiveness
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.520]   of a given dose
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.520]   of SSRI.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.760]   However,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.540]   there are other studies
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.300]   that have looked
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.320]   directly at creatine
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.020]   supplementation
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.660]   in the absence
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.560]   of SSRIs,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:30.920]   and those are
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.700]   interesting as well.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.660]   So let's talk
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.220]   a little bit more
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.420]   about novel therapeutic
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.560]   compounds for the treatment
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.360]   of major depression.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.760]   one is ketamine,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.220]   which is getting
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.240]   increasing interest
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.800]   in psychiatric clinics
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.260]   in various experimental
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.180]   and clinical studies.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:44.980]   They create
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.920]   dissociative
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.500]   anesthetic states,
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.620]   so dissociative states
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.060]   where people
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.000]   don't feel
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.340]   as closely meshed
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.240]   with their emotions
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.640]   and their perceptions.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.020]   Clinically,
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.940]   what's described
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.320]   in the trials
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.060]   for ketamine
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.420]   and things like it
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.300]   are that people
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.180]   who are depressed
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.420]   will take ketamine,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.380]   will experience
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.620]   a kind of separate
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.020]   shortness
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.200]   from their grief
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.260]   and from their emotions
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.480]   and that possibly
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.900]   there's plasticity.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.740]   There actually shifts
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.860]   in the neural circuitry
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.220]   such that their emotions
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.640]   don't weigh
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.800]   on them so heavily.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.840]   It's not always
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.660]   about just getting
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.380]   people peppy
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.020]   and excited
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.600]   and happy.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.280]   There also seems
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.960]   to be a requirement
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.780]   for getting them
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.920]   distanced
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.280]   from their own grief.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.560]   And this brings us
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.160]   back to something
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.640]   that we talked
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.440]   about way back
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.860]   at the beginning
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.600]   of this episode,
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.500]   which was
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.680]   this particular feature
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.360]   of the anti-self
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   confabulation.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.400]   That everything
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.060]   that happens
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:40.920]   is a reflection
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.000]   that I should say
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.040]   for the depressed person
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.540]   that everything
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.120]   that happens
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.780]   is a reflection
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.120]   of how life is bad
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:46.940]   and their experiences
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.040]   just point to the fact
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.440]   that nothing
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.220]   is going to get better.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.920]   This is the common
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.140]   language of depression.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.120]   If this is very depressing
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.800]   to hear me talk about,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.940]   it is heavy.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.120]   And that's what it's like
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.460]   to hear these things.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.160]   It's even heavier,
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.500]   of course,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.020]   for somebody
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.920]   to experience them.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.940]   And those beliefs,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.120]   those patterns of guilt
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.900]   and grief
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.800]   and anhedonia
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.740]   and delusional
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.320]   anti-self confabulations,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.680]   those are the things
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.320]   that eventually,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.800]   if they get severe enough,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.220]   start to convert
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.740]   into things
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.480]   like self-harm,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.020]   mutilation,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.540]   and in the most tragic
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.040]   of cases,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.580]   of course,
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.280]   suicide.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.700]   And so I think
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.160]   we can look
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.000]   to these treatments
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.340]   such as ketamine
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.960]   and its use
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.580]   in the clinic
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.220]   as ways for people
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.540]   to get distanced
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.980]   from the negative affect
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.860]   that they feel
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.020]   isn't just inside them
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.100]   or overwhelms them,
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.500]   but that for the very
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.760]   severely depressed person,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.320]   they feel is them.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.500]   Another category
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.240]   of treatments
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.740]   that's being actively
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.500]   explored now
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.280]   in laboratories
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.540]   and in the psychiatry realm
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.140]   are the psychedelics.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.220]   And that's a huge
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.100]   category of compounds.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.140]   However,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.320]   one in particular,
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.780]   psilocybin is one
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.360]   that's being
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.600]   most intensely
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.980]   and actively pursued
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.900]   for its capacity
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.840]   to treat major
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.700]   depressive disorder.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.940]   But let's focus
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.800]   on psilocybin
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.200]   for its capacity
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   to rewire neural circuits
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.640]   and alleviate depression.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.720]   There have been
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.600]   anecdotal data
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.540]   or evidence
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.100]   over the years
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.320]   that psilocybin
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.200]   has this capacity.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.300]   How does psilocybin work?
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.880]   Well, psilocybin engages
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.860]   or increases
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.320]   serotonin transmission,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.780]   meaning it increases
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.880]   the amount of serotonin
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.340]   mainly by acting
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.220]   at these 5H2A receptors.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.160]   But where in the brain
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.280]   does it happen
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.520]   and what are the major effects?
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.100]   First, let's talk
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.960]   about the major effects
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.360]   because I think
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:35.880]   that's what people
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.620]   are interested in.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.000]   The study that I'd like
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.540]   to highlight
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.920]   is a fairly recent one.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.680]   It was published
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.480]   in May of 2021
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.720]   in journal,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.940]   journal, excuse me,
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.600]   of the American
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.620]   Medical Association
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.400]   Psychiatry,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.040]   so JAMA Psychiatry,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.780]   and it's entitled
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.080]   Effects of Psilocybin
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.980]   Assisted Therapy
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.340]   on Major Depressive Disorder,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.880]   a Randomized Clinical Trial.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.500]   Basically, what they did
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.480]   was they screened
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:28:59.980]   for patients
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.900]   to come into the clinic.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.380]   These were people
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:01.940]   that suffered
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.400]   from major depressive disorder
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.200]   and administered
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.320]   either one
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.580]   or two rounds
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.600]   of psilocybin.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.140]   Typically,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.060]   it was 20 milligrams
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.360]   per kilogram of body weight,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.500]   so it depends on body weight.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.820]   What's really striking
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.680]   about this study
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.320]   is that there was
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.840]   a very significant
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.060]   improvement
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.680]   in mood and affect
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.360]   and relief
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.580]   from depressive symptoms
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.640]   in anywhere
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.580]   from 50 to 70%
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.500]   of the people
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.240]   that were subjects
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.840]   in the study
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.080]   who received
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.440]   the psilocybin treatment.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.180]   These are really enormous
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.400]   and significant effects.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.460]   what's really interesting
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.580]   is there are some
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.600]   common themes
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.800]   to psilocybin administration
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.440]   and experience
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.560]   that lead to relief
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.720]   from depressive symptoms,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.400]   but they are subjectively,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.140]   excuse me,
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.520]   subjectively very varied,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.800]   meaning that whether
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.880]   or not people feel
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   they had a good experience
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   or a bad experience,
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.660]   whether or not people
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.980]   thought about their parents
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.740]   or thought about
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.500]   the color of the ceiling
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.000]   doesn't seem to have
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.500]   too much of an impact
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.140]   on whether or not
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.860]   they receive relief
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.080]   during these studies,
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.480]   in these clinical studies.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.100]   It seems like
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.960]   different people
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.520]   can have lots
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.400]   of different experiences
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.480]   and still receive benefit.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.900]   it's somehow rewiring
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.660]   associations between events,
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.500]   emotional events,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.300]   past events,
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.200]   current events,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.140]   and future events
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.080]   in ways that allow people
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.820]   to get some sort of relief
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.480]   or distance
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.080]   from these narratives,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.060]   these depressive stories
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.100]   about their past
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.640]   and present
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.480]   and allow them
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.780]   to see new opportunity
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.420]   and optimism
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.040]   in the future.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.220]   One of the most common
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.060]   questions I get
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.800]   for this podcast
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.460]   is about different diets,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.420]   different regimes,
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.720]   different nutritional plans,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.080]   things like keto,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.120]   ketogenic diet,
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.660]   or vegan diets,
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.500]   or intermittent fasting,
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.920]   or the all-meat diet,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   the so-called lion diet,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.700]   et cetera.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.580]   There are actually
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.880]   really interesting data
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.060]   relating nutrition and diet
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.860]   to major depressive disorder.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.460]   There have been
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.100]   some explorations
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.660]   of whether or not
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.520]   a vegan diet
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.300]   can improve symptoms
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.880]   of depression.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.140]   Not a lot of data,
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.300]   not impressive data.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.120]   There have been
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.600]   very few controlled studies
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.860]   looking at the carnivore
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.700]   all-meat diet.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.300]   However,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.040]   the ketogenic diet
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.000]   has been explored
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.240]   for its ability
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.140]   to relieve
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.960]   certain symptoms
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.500]   of depression,
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.120]   in particular
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.860]   to what's called
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.460]   maintain euthymia.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.980]   Euthymia is the kind
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.900]   of state of equilibrium
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.720]   between a manic episode
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.300]   and a depressive episode
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.640]   in a manic bipolar person.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.900]   euthymia is that kind
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.700]   of place in the middle
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.960]   where people feel
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.800]   neither too high
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.520]   nor too low.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.620]   And there are
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.740]   some interesting studies
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.400]   looking at the ketogenic diet
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.960]   for maintaining euthymia
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.000]   in manic depressives,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.400]   but also in people
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.700]   with major depressive disorder.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.200]   The ketogenic diet,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.420]   by way of increasing
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.420]   ketone metabolism
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.440]   or shifting brain's metabolism
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.460]   over to ketones,
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.860]   tends to modulate GABA
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.220]   such that GABA
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.680]   is more active
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.560]   and adjusts
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.060]   the so-called
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.580]   GABA glutamate balance.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   This is getting technical,
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.300]   but glutamate
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.200]   is an excitatory
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.320]   neurotransmitter.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.780]   GABA is inhibitory
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.380]   neurotransmitter
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.160]   and their balance
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.680]   is vital
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.780]   for neuroplasticity,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.960]   for maintaining
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.660]   healthy levels
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.220]   of activity
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:24.880]   in the brain,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.920]   et cetera.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.860]   And so there is
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.360]   decent evidence
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.240]   that people
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.720]   with major depressive disorders,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.940]   in particular,
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.920]   the people
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.580]   with major depressive disorders
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.140]   that are refractory,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.860]   meaning they don't respond
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.540]   to classical antidepressants,
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.440]   can benefit,
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.160]   it seems,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.720]   from the ketogenic diet.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.360]   It's really interesting
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.240]   that eating
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.080]   in a particular way,
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.480]   lowering carbohydrates
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.280]   to the point
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:53.960]   where you rely
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.920]   on ketogenic metabolism
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.820]   in the brain
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.120]   increases GABA
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.540]   and can provide
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.040]   some relief
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.640]   for depressive symptoms
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.100]   and that in particular
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.060]   that seems to have
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.920]   positive effects
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.220]   in people that are refractory
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:06.980]   or don't respond
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.060]   to classic antidepressants.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.300]   So today we've covered
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.880]   what at least feels to me
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   like a tremendous amount
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.640]   of material.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.040]   This topic of depression
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.700]   is indeed an enormous topic
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.000]   to try and get our arms around.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.900]   We talked about
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.620]   the symptomology,
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.260]   we talked about
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:20.960]   some of the underlying
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.260]   neurochemistry and biology,
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.640]   and then we talked
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.260]   about approaches
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:24.960]   to deal with it
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.940]   that are really grounded
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.260]   in the neurochemistry
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:27.920]   and biology.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.260]   I just want to recap
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.200]   a few of those tools
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.260]   and what those things are.
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.780]   So number one,
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.420]   don't overwhelm
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.340]   your pleasure centers
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.720]   either through activities
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.500]   or compounds.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.020]   It might seem counterintuitive,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.240]   but you're setting yourself up
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:41.960]   for anhedonia
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.580]   and depression
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.960]   if you do that.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.120]   Second of all,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.500]   talked about
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.600]   the norepinephrine system
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.960]   and how the norepinephrine system
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.220]   is really deficient
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.760]   in many forms
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.900]   of major depression
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.640]   and in depression.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.840]   There is now
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.480]   more deliberate pursuit
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.880]   of norepinephrine
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.760]   inducing activities
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.420]   that are healthy,
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.280]   that aren't
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.800]   adrenaline seeking
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.360]   per se.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.140]   Things like exercise
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:05.940]   that will increase
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.380]   our levels
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.180]   of noradrenaline.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.140]   I'd be remiss
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.160]   if I said
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   that these activities
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.660]   could completely
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.680]   eliminate
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.540]   depressive symptoms
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:13.920]   in people
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.100]   with major depressive disorder.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.540]   I don't think
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.120]   that's the case.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:16.440]   And again,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.100]   I want to acknowledge
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.480]   that people
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.300]   with major
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.120]   depressive symptoms
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.480]   often don't have
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.120]   the energy,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.000]   the willingness
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.780]   or the capacity
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.440]   to engage
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.340]   in some of these activities,
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:25.960]   but things
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.180]   like cold showers,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.220]   deliberate cold showers,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.160]   things like
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.440]   regular exercise,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.100]   they aren't
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.720]   just feel-good activities.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.620]   They actually engage
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.680]   the norepinephrine system
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.880]   and keep that system
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.420]   tuned up
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:37.960]   and allow us
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.360]   to increase
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.440]   our norepinephrine levels
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.000]   at will
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.860]   on a regular basis
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   and their mood-enhancing effects
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.660]   are real effects
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.360]   at the level
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.220]   of neurochemistry.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.600]   Then we talked
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   about EPAs,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.420]   these essential fatty acids,
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:48.960]   and it's clear
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.480]   that for most people
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.020]   getting above
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.940]   1,000 milligrams
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.920]   and probably even closer
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.120]   to 2,000 milligrams
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.560]   per day of EPAs
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.240]   can be beneficial
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.760]   for mood,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.440]   especially in attempts
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:34:59.940]   to treat
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.640]   or offset
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.980]   major depressive disorder.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.040]   We also talked
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.700]   about exercise
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.600]   and how EPA
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.200]   and exercise
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.280]   on a regular basis
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.080]   can offset
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.320]   these inflammatory pathways.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   And then we talked
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.620]   about the prescription
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.160]   compounds
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.820]   and the compounds
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.680]   that are being used
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.620]   mainly in the course
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.100]   of studies
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.280]   and of psychiatry
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.040]   and depression,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.840]   things like ketamine,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   psilocybin,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.580]   and related compounds.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.400]   And then lastly,
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.460]   we talked about ketosis,
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.480]   which may not be right
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:21.940]   for everybody,
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.720]   but might be right
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.380]   for certain individuals
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:24.940]   out there
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.680]   who are grappling
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.180]   with this.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.400]   I want to thank you
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:27.980]   for embarking
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.660]   on this journey
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.200]   of trying to understand
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.100]   what is depression,
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.980]   how does it work,
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.000]   and how to treat it.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.040]   And thank you
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.640]   for your interest
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.200]   in science.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.260]   you
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.760]   you
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.820]   you
