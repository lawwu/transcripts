[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.280]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, where, during bull markets, we had questions about leveraged
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   ETFs, and during bear markets, we had questions about bonds and Roth IRAs. So, we'll see if
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.480]   that transition happens. We're still in the latter half, in terms of questions, but we'll
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.880]   see if that changes, because things have been going a little better lately.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.900]   Yeah, I'm feeling good.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.040]   How are we feeling better? Good?
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.920]   Yeah, yeah. Feeling good.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.840]   You know, it's funny, because everyone says, "Why should the stock market change just because
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.720]   the calendar flipped to a new year?" And look what happened. It worked. That's all we needed
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.480]   to do, change the calendar.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360]   Is this still the Santa Claus rally?
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280]   I think this is just the New Year's Resolution rally. So, we're going into February. Things
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.000]   are going well. Just remember this feeling the next time stocks are down like 10% in
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800]   a month. It could happen. Alright, let's do some questions.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.360]   Okay. Up first today, we have a question from Larry. "Without getting into the politics
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   of throwing the U.S. government into default, the threat is very real. How about a discussion
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.680]   on how retirees should position themselves to protect their portfolio? Us old guys don't
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.680]   have years to recover from a political sabotage of the markets and the economy. You know old
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   folks read and listen to your stuff too!"
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.240]   Yes. Fair point, Larry. I think our YouTube audience definitely eschews younger. I think
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.080]   podcasts, if we're doing an over-generalization here, are probably more Gen X. And then, my
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.560]   blog actually does have a decent percentage of baby boomers. How do I know this? Because
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.960]   a lot of them ask me, "How do I print it out on regular paper to read it?" So, that has
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.880]   to be boomers, right?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   I would think.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.160]   Obviously, there's some overlap. Okay. So, obviously, the market doesn't seem to care
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.360]   about the debt ceiling. Now, as of this recording, I got the S&P up almost 9% year-to-date. NASDAQ
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.680]   100 up almost 17% in 2023. Bonds are also rallying. So, the stock market doesn't care
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.280]   about the debt ceiling debate yet. I think part of the reason the markets don't really
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   seem to care is because -- we've been through this before. It's basically political theater.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.960]   I think a lot of it, the debt ceiling stuff, is just, it makes politicians feel important.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.720]   They use it as leverage. It's a negotiating ploy. Could we see some crazy politician get
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.280]   into office and take this too far and possibly lead to a default? It wouldn't surprise me
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.640]   with the people that we have as our politicians these days. But I think a default caused by
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   a politician, that's not like some crazy financial crisis.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.120]   Be careful there. We have people on Capitol Hill that watch the show.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   I know. I'm just saying, could someone take it too far in the future? Yes, I think. But
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.680]   that seems like a more of a short-term problem than a long-term one to me. But even if you
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.840]   know how badly a politician's going to screw this up someday, I don't know that you could
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.040]   position your portfolio for it.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.080]   So back in the summer of 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, right?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.920]   This is from -- it felt like a big deal at the time. This is from a BBC story at the
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.480]   time. I'm going to read this. One of the world's leading credit agencies, Standard & Poor's,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160]   has downgraded the United States' top-notch AAA credit rating for the first time ever.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.840]   S&P cut the long-term U.S. rating by one notch to AA+, with a negative outlook citing concerns
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   about budget deficits. Correspondents say the downgrade could erode investors' confidence
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.920]   in the world's largest economy. It's already struggling with debts. Unemployment of 9.1%
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.240]   and fears of a possible double-dip recession. The downgrade is a major embarrassment for
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.200]   the administration of President Barack Obama and could raise the cost of U.S. government
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   borrowing. This, in turn, could trickle down to higher interest rates for local governments
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.080]   and individuals. That sounded pretty scary at the time. I think a lot of people were
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   worried about that, right?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   John, let's do a chart on bond returns over the ensuing year. Bonds went nuts after this
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.080]   happened. Long-term Treasuries were up almost 30%. The AG was up over 6%. Ten-year Treasuries
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.560]   were up over 10%. Now, why did this happen? Interest rates actually fell. And they not
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.280]   only fell a little bit, they fell a lot, and they fell immediately. So, this is the 10-year.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.920]   You can see, look, it dropped almost immediately from the time they downgraded the credit rating.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.840]   It was like 2.6%. It went down to 1.4%. And, okay, how about the stock market? Things did
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.200]   get weird in the stock market in the short term. So, the Monday after the downgrade -- and
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.000]   I remember this period, it was crazy -- the stock market fell 6% in a day. Right? John,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.320]   you can do a chart off for a sec here. I'll get back to this one. The day after that,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   it was up more than 5%. The day after that, it was down more than 4%. And the day after
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   that, it was up 5%. This is back-to-back-to-back-to-back days of down 6, up 5; down 4, up 5. It was
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   a crazy week.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.560]   Lewis: Michael Scott would call, "Snip, snap, snip, snap."
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.800]   Lewis: To be fair, at the time, we were going through the European debt crisis. People were
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.600]   worried about a double-dip recession. We were already in the midst of a correction. And
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.240]   the stock market actually bottomed in October. So, John put this up. This is including that
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.840]   down 6% day to start things. The S&P was up almost 20% a year later. So, the stock market
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.040]   did not really care. Could we see some short-term volatility if we have a prolonged debt ceiling
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.400]   discussion and debate and close to a default? Sure. Markets could get spooked. But I think
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.720]   that has more to say with the current trends and rates and economic growth and the stock
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.880]   market and what's happening than the political theory in D.C. Maybe people would use that
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.360]   as an excuse. We have a huge rally here, and then the politicians decide they want to do
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.840]   something crazy, and that causes some stock market volatility, and we see some short-term
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.460]   volatility. Sure. Does that mean you should change your portfolio because of it? No. Short-term
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.360]   volatility in the markets is always going to be a thing. That's always a risk, whether
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   it's political, economic, or otherwise. So, I don't think you change your portfolio because
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   of it. I think you always have your portfolio gauged to figure out that short-term risk.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.880]   The other thing to mention here, every time this happens, people complain about how much
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.960]   debt we have in this country. So, John, do a chart on. This is the U.S. debt clock. Now,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.280]   this looks like a website from 1994. It's still going. You can calculate all this stuff
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.400]   on this debt. You can see that I highlighted here that U.S. national debt is more than
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.040]   $31 trillion. That sounds like a lot of money. Now, I'm not even going to try to figure out
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.080]   how much the United States is worth in terms of assets, beyond the tax revenue we're bringing
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.960]   in. I think I've seen estimates that, if you include all the land we own, like federal
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.100]   land and state land, I think the U.S. government owns 25-30% of all land in this country. So,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.680]   if you really wanted to offset the liabilities with the assets, the United States has a lot
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   of assets. But, even beyond that, let's look at the interest we pay as a percentage of
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.880]   GDP. So, John, chart on here. This is interest expense as a percentage of gross domestic
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.600]   product. Look back in the 1980s and '90s. It was way higher than it is today. It's going
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.440]   up because rates are going up and debt has gone up. But, we're still able to service
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.160]   this debt, even with higher rates. And, obviously, the debt was much lower back then, but rates
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.560]   were higher, and GDP was obviously much lower. So, John, throw up the next chart on GDP.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.080]   This is the latest GDP reading as of Q4 2022. $26 trillion and growing. And it's not like
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.900]   the GDP is an accumulated amount like the debt is, right? GDP is something that we produce
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.080]   year in and year out. So, this year, it's probably going to be bigger than $26 trillion,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.160]   if it looks like the economy is on strong footing, which it is. So, I know that the
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.360]   debt number is scary, but I just think that people have been worrying about government
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   spending forever. This is a cover story from 1972 in time. Is the U.S. going broke? I think
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.800]   as long as the economy continues to grow, federal debt is going to--
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   That's a good cover.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.120]   It really is. And people were scared. This is 1972. I think as long as the economy continues
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.960]   to grow, and federal debt is going to grow as well, as long as the pie gets bigger. And,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   unfortunately, unless the politicians get rid of the debt ceiling thing, it's always
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.240]   going to be an argument every few years when we get to this. So, I think you have to get
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.600]   used to it. But I also think that people probably worry too much about government debt and the
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.720]   implications that it could have. I think this is something that we're going to look back
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.280]   at another 10, 20, 30 years, and it's going to be, I don't know, $70 trillion, and people
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.200]   are going to go, "$70 trillion is too high!" I think people just have to get used to it.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.080]   If debt is growing, it probably means that the economy is growing as well. And that's
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   a good thing.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.040]   - Also, can't we just make a giant platinum coin or something?
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.960]   - Sure. Pay it off. Here's the other thing, though. I've seen people say, "We should get
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   rid of all debt. Just abolish United States debt. Get rid of it. Pay it all off." That
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.620]   debt is an asset to someone else. Retirees, pension plans, who own bonds, who own treasuries,
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.560]   those liabilities that the United States is creating is an asset for someone else. Those
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.320]   T-bills you're earning 4 or 5% on right now, which we're going to talk about in a few questions
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.040]   later here, that's an asset from U.S. government borrowing. So you take that away, then we
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.440]   don't have any bonds for people. I mean, you have to go further than risk for bonds, different
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.160]   types of bonds, but those are assets, too.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   - Right.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.640]   - Let's do another one.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.760]   - Okay. Up next, we have a question, I think, from Twitter?
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.280]   - Yeah, someone on Twitter posted this.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.480]   - Okay. "What's it going to take to right-size the Treasury yield curve from its current
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.800]   inverted state? Isn't that what we're all waiting for, when 10-year and 30-year Treasuries
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.000]   have higher rates than 2- and 5-year? Also, why do we need or want that? I presume it's
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.840]   because it signals that the markets think long-term returns will be higher than short-term
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.200]   returns, but I'm not entirely clear on it."
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.000]   - So he's staying on the theme that bond questions are coming in hot and heavy lately, still.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.400]   - Right. This is a question I've seen other people have before, too.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.060]   - So, John, give me the chart of the change in yield curve. This is over the past 13 months.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.280]   The blue curve on the bottom, that's as of 12/31/2021, so 13 months later, the gray curve
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.960]   happens. You can see the bottom curve, it's upward-sloping. So shorter-term yields, 1,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   2, 3, 6-month T-bills, are much lower than longer-term yields, 10-year, 20-year, 30-year.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.080]   Now look at the line above it, the gray line, that's as of February 1st. Shorter-term yields,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.160]   1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, are much higher than 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30-year
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.480]   Treasury bonds, right? And you can see that upward-sloping curve, that's the normal, that's
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.680]   what we want. And that makes sense, because why? You should earn higher rates of return
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.020]   when you extend your time horizon and fixed income, because you're taking on more interest
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.760]   rate risk, more inflation risk, more economic risk. More things can happen the longer your
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.440]   time horizon goes, and not always in a good way, so investors typically require higher
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.960]   yields for going further on that risk curve. And now that it's inverted, that doesn't make
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.700]   any sense, right? Because you're being paid higher yield to take less risk, and the people
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.280]   further on the risk curve are being paid less. So typically, you use the yield curve as a
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.320]   way to gauge the health of the economy, right? When longer-term yields are higher than shorter-term
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.960]   yields, that typically shows signs of healthy economic progress, right? People think things
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.080]   are going to get better in the future, higher growth potentially, higher inflation, things
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.760]   are going to be better. An inverted yield curve, or narrower yield, signals that things
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.520]   could get worse. And if you look back at it, it's got like an 8 out of 8 in terms of predicting
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.640]   an oncoming recession. Yield curve inverts, in the next, call it, 6 to 18 months, we get
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.760]   a recession. Today, I think things are a little trickier because of the role the Fed is playing
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   here in the yield curve. So Cam Harvey is the guy who -- the Duke professor who came
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.720]   up with this signal, actually thinks it might not work this time. So John, he wrote a research
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.680]   piece -- throw this up here real quick -- he gave some reasons why he thinks his own signal,
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   the inverted yield curve might not work, and he talks about the strength of the labor market,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.800]   the fact that people being laid off, especially in the tech sector, are finding jobs much
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.880]   easier because they're more highly skilled. Consumers are just in a much better position.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.720]   The financial sector is much healthier, and they've taken steps because of the regulations
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:08.360]   to be fine. And obviously, the Fed. The Fed is the one that is increasing short-term rates.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.480]   And so I guess that explains what's going on in the yield curve. But what's going to
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.800]   happen to bring it back in line? Well, I think the easy answer just is the Fed. Long-term
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.640]   yields don't seem to believe that inflation is going to be a long-term problem, and so
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.760]   they haven't moved up much at all. So we have 30-year yields that are basically the lowest
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.880]   on the whole yield curve. So I think a recession would probably help us get back there, unfortunately.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   Maybe inflation falling a little bit would help, too. But it's basically the Fed lowering
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.560]   short-term rates. That's what's going to have to happen unless inflation continues to -- starts
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   going back up again and long-term rates decide to go up. It is kind of crazy, though, if
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:49.040]   you think that. We had 9% inflation, and long-term bond yields didn't go much above 4%. So if
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.760]   that's not going to do it, I don't know what is. So it's basically the Fed. The Fed is
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.840]   going to have to lower short-term rates. That's going to take us out of an inverted yield
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.280]   curve.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.040]   Harjes: It all comes down to the Fed.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.760]   Lewis: Everything does, right?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.200]   Harjes: Seems like it.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.480]   Lewis: This is a nice segue into the next one, which I think is kind of related here.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.440]   Harjes: Up next, we have a question from Matt. "Everyone is talking about T-bills paying
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.920]   around 4%. But why would you lock up money in T-bills for 2, 10, or 20 years when you
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.480]   have these high-yield savings accounts paying out basically the same while keeping your
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.420]   funds fully liquid? I've researched it and have yet to uncover some catch. They're FDIC-insured,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.840]   and the biggest downside I found is that they're typically online banks and don't have physical
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   branches or their own ATMs. So you have to sync up a regular bank account to transfer
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.100]   money, which takes about five minutes. Am I missing something? Why would you purchase
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.440]   T-bills when you can get the same returns with one of these high-yield savings accounts?"
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.600]   This is a good question.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.200]   Lewis: We've been getting, actually, a lot of questions like this. Some people say it's
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.880]   crazy to keep your money in a savings account when T-bill yields are actually higher. Some
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   people say it's crazy to go through the process of buying T-bills when savings accounts are
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.400]   easier. That's what this one is saying. Before we get into that, I need to give some nerdy
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:59.000]   bond definitions to this person here. Matt, just so you know, you can't call everything
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.360]   a T-bill. T-bills have a maturity of one month to one year. Treasury notes or Treasury bonds
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.000]   have a maturity of two years to 30 years. The way that it works is, the biggest difference
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.820]   is if you buy a T-bill, you say you want to get $1,000, you put $950 in on day one, and
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.560]   let's say you buy a 12-month T-bill, a year later you're going to get $1,000 at par. You
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.320]   don't actually get those coupon payments like you do from a bond or a Treasury note. That's
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.960]   the difference. I just wanted to make sure our guy knows what he's talking about here.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.280]   If he's going to school someone, he knows his T-bills versus T-bonds. That's how that
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.200]   works.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.400]   The good news is, because of the Fed's actions, these short-term rates are about as attractive
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   as they've been on a relative basis in decades, I guess. So John, do a chart on. This is three-month
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.520]   T-bill yields versus 30-year Treasury yields, right? So you can see the changes over time.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.400]   Obviously, they've been falling. This is since 1981. So I calculated the difference. So going
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.680]   back to 1980, early 1980s, the average difference between long-term yields, these 30-year Treasuries,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   and short-term yields, which is three-month T-bills, the average yield has been a little
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.840]   more than 2% higher for long-term rates, right? Long-term rates have averaged 2% more than
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.480]   ultra-short-term rates.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.880]   Right now, T-bills yield 1% or more than 30-year Treasuries, which is basically the highest
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.760]   I could find in that time frame. So in over 40 years, this is the highest spread between
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.140]   ultra-short yields and ultra-long yields. So that's pretty good. So anyone parking their
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.800]   cash in money markets, CDs, savings accounts, and I'm talking online savings accounts here,
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   not necessarily bank savings accounts and T-bills, are being given a gift from the Fed
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.680]   right now. So you don't have to take a lot of risk on your cash right now.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.080]   So which option is better, an online savings account, T-bills, maybe money market, or CD?
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.440]   I think they all have pros and cons, and it probably doesn't really matter. T-bills' yields
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.560]   currently are higher than online savings accounts. So we're talking 4.5% to 4.6% for T-bills
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.080]   right now, depending on what month and what duration we're talking. And I've found 3.3%
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.480]   to 3.5% for online savings accounts. So that's a pretty decent, you can get over 100 basis
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.400]   points more in T-bills. And you can buy those T-bills directly from Treasury Direct, from
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.200]   the government, or you can just buy any of them.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.720]   Not to brag, but my high-yield savings account is paying 4.03% right now.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   4.03%, okay.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   That 0.03% is important.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.160]   Okay, so you're earning 4%. You've told us it's some ... Are you sure this isn't a Ponzi
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   scheme? No.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.560]   I mean, who knows? But yeah, they're not so far.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.160]   No, 4% is ... Because T-bills are where they are, that makes sense, right? And as the Fed
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.880]   continues to raise rates, these rates should continue to go ... Because the Fed just raised
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.360]   another 25 basis points yesterday. So online savings accounts are probably easier to deal
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.480]   with in terms of moving cash in and out of your account. That's, for me, the ease of
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.880]   access, I think, is the biggest thing for me.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.360]   Both of these yields can and will change. So if the Fed keeps raising rates, they're
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.840]   going to go up. So again, if the Fed does another 25 basis points at the next meeting,
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.440]   these yields are going to continue to go up. And even if bond yields on the longer end
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.080]   don't move, these are going to have to follow the Fed funds rate, even if they don't follow
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.680]   it one for one. So you could lock in higher rates with CD yields, because these yields
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.200]   are going to fall if the Fed does decide to cut rates and take us out of the inverted
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.520]   yield curve. These rates are going to fall, too, and probably in a hurry. They're going
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.180]   to go down a lot faster than they went up. That's for sure. So when the Fed does decide
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.520]   to cut rates, whenever that is, it's going to happen. But as long as you don't have your
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.440]   money sitting in a brick-and-mortar bank earning 20 basis points right now, I don't think it
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.640]   really matters all that much. If you have T-bills or online ... It's probably not that
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.480]   much of a difference.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.160]   Yeah. Years ago, my PNC account, a couple years ago, was like 0.01%. It was like what
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.400]   the savings was getting.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.280]   Especially if you're buying an ETF, there's a T-bill ETF, you're not locking your money
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.960]   up in that. You're not necessarily locking it up. Even if you buy the actual bonds, you
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   can still sell them at a premium discount.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.880]   To be clear on that, that's something I don't quite understand. Is the yield on that ETF
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.500]   going to be the same as what the actual T-bills would be yielding? Or will there be a spread?
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.860]   It's going to be pretty close. Depending on the day you buy the actual T-bill, it might
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:17:00.540]   be a little more or less. But the T-bill yields right now on those ETFs are pretty close.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.420]   I would just say enjoy this while it lasts, because the situation where short-term rates
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.660]   are way higher than long-term rates, it simply can't last. The Fed can hold on for a while,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.780]   but that's not normal. So I'd say just enjoy it while it lasts.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.780]   Good advice.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.940]   All right. Let's do another one.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.580]   Up next, we have a bit of a bummer, but it's a good question I think a lot of people can
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.820]   relate to. It's from a longtime listener. I'm not going to name them because of the
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:33.580]   topic. This question is, "My mother recently told me a story about a family friend. Let's
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.900]   call her Anna. Anna and her husband were well off, fully paid off house, and about to enjoy
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.160]   their golden years. No kids and a sizable nest egg. Anna's husband, probably due to
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.580]   some kind of dementia, began to compulsively gamble. Anna knew next to nothing about the
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.580]   family finances, as her husband had done a good job managing the books for their entire
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.720]   marriage. He gambled everything, from their retirement funds, to jewelry, to the title
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.980]   of their car. Long story short, they lost everything, and he disappeared. She ended
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.120]   up dying alone in a cheap nursing home paid for by Medicaid. My parents are getting up
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.900]   there in age, and I wonder what kind of safeguards I could help them put in place in case something
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.460]   happened to them mentally. For instance, how do I make sure they won't get cleaned out
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.180]   by a Nigerian Prince email scam?"
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.100]   This is something that you don't really think about. Longevity is a huge risk in retirement,
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.620]   but people don't think about the fact that you could have huge cognitive decline. Part
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.780]   of that could be because some sort of brain problem. You have dementia, Alzheimer's, or
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.580]   something, and that's something you have to think about. To me, this is very much a financial
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.620]   planning question, more than anything. Let's bring in a financial planner. Kevin Young
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.220]   has been on the show before. Hey, Kevin. How's it going?
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.900]   Hey, Kevin. Hey, guys. Thanks for having me.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   My sister-in-law was recently telling me a story about someone in her family who skimped
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.620]   and saved, didn't take any risks their entire career, worked for 40 years at the same company,
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.260]   saved six figures, was ready for retirement, and the first week they retired, handed their
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.900]   money over to someone who turned out to be a scam artist and took their life savings.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.420]   Unfortunately, the people with the biggest targets on their backs for some type of scam
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.980]   is people with the most money. The people with the most money tend to be older people.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.460]   These are risks that you don't really think about in terms of people worry about interest
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.080]   rates and all the other stuff, people, debt defaults, and recessions, and all this other
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.700]   stuff. This is a true problem for a lot of people. As your faculties decline with age,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.220]   it's much easier to get taken advantage of. Kevin, what are some ways to, if you're looking
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.940]   at your parents and saying, "Listen, I just want to make sure that we keep them safe and
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:35.700]   their money safe. How do we do that?" What are some safeguards we can put in place?
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:46.820]   This is a really tough situation to hear about. It's hopefully avoidable for a lot of people.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.220]   There are some aspects to this. That's obviously a very extreme case, but even in a less extreme
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:59.260]   case where the money just isn't being managed properly. Maybe the person, "Okay, well, my
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.060]   husband or my wife has always taken care of this, and as time goes on, you think everything's
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:10.580]   still being done properly, but oops, the person in charge of it hasn't switched you out of
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:16.620]   being 100% equities in 20 years." Maybe that worked out really well, but it's not going
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.700]   to work out so well into the teeth of a 2022 if you're retired.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.460]   As little as the portfolio just being managed properly out to this obviously very extreme
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.640]   case of the money being all gone, there are a couple of things you can do at increasing
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:42.020]   levels of security. The first thing they could do for your parents is if they've got a brokerage
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:48.060]   account, an industry-wide thing now is something called a trusted contact. That's somebody
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:53.860]   that could be yourself, it could be a family member, somebody you trust that is just privy
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.580]   to the very basics of the account. The person would have no control over the account. They
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.840]   can call up and make any changes. But for me as an advisor, if I have a client that
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.280]   calls me up and asks me to do something kind of out of character, let's say they're living
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.560]   on $10,000 a month and they call me up and say, "I need $100,000 right now. Wire it right
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.780]   away." If that person's son is on the account as a trusted contact, I might call the son
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.600]   and just say, "Hey, got this request from your mom and just seemed a little out of character.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:30.560]   Is everything okay?" They can't stop the withdrawal, but that might be somebody who can just sort
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.160]   of put out a speed bump and call and make sure everything's okay. And that way as the
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.640]   advisor and certainly as a loved one, you're aware of what's going on.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.560]   Well, that to me sounds like another form of diversification. So we talk about the perils
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.920]   of concentration in portfolio investing. We've had a lot of people come to us and say, "I've
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.440]   been managing the finances my whole career. I want an advisor because I want the rest
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.320]   of the family to understand that something's going to be okay if I get hit by a bus or
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.560]   I keel over or I get dementia or whatever it is." So I think that, to your point, it's
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.920]   kind of diversifying the people involved in the account and maybe just opening up the
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.800]   lines of communication to other people.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.960]   Yeah, exactly. I talk a lot about, and I stole this line from one of our other advisors,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.760]   Paul, but we talk a lot about eliminating a single point of failure. And in some cases,
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.420]   that might be working with somebody that is all by themselves in an office. I've seen
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:29.060]   it before where somebody has an accountant and the accountant dies suddenly and he never
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.560]   had an assistant. Nobody has any clue where his files are. It's a huge mess. Similar to,
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.840]   "Hey, my dad always managed the account and now he's gone and nobody knows the passwords.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.240]   Nobody knows where the money is," et cetera. So eliminating that single point of failure
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.080]   is really important.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.320]   The next layer of protection you could do is if your parents are good with it, either
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:57.600]   they can have power of attorney on each other's accounts or they could name a sibling, somebody
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   else, again, somebody who is responsible. The power of attorney takes the trust of-
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.480]   Not to brag, I'm the power of the attorney for my parents and my in-laws as well because
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.800]   I'm the finance guy.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:15.640]   There you go. And probably Michael's accounts too. So the POA is a step above that trust
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.160]   of contact. That person actually can make changes to an investment portfolio. They can
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.000]   stop a withdrawal. They can take money out, in and out, et cetera. So that person you
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.840]   definitely want to make sure is somebody that is of sound mind and is accountable.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.960]   The next level of that is sort of the same thing, but it would just be a trust. If you
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.400]   don't have somebody in the family or you don't want to take on that burden yourself or put
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:45.840]   that on your mom or your dad or vice versa, you can hire a corporate trustee. You could
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.680]   either hire a corporate trustee or again, have somebody that you trust do it. And basically
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.000]   you just put the assets in a revocable trust. I'm making this way simpler and sound easier
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.560]   than it actually is and probably less expensive. But having that trustee there to make those
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.080]   decisions and make sure that things are being done properly is a good way to go.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.160]   That's just a legal document drafted up by an attorney?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.240]   Yep, exactly. And you would need an attorney to do a POA as well. So an attorney would
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.560]   probably be a very good person to talk to about this kind of stuff and figuring out
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:30.160]   ways to protect assets from a variety of potential issues. And then the last thing being, and
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.840]   I'm kind of talking my book here, but a fiduciary advisor. This again, serves two purposes.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.000]   One is you're removing that single point of failure just from an asset allocation perspective,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.720]   to say nothing of the extremes of the money was misused. But I know in our case, if something
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:55.800]   like this starts to happen and the advisor sees odd behavior or sees things that don't
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:02.820]   look quite right, we have safeguards in place as a firm, as do good fiduciary advisors across
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.760]   the country. They will go to their compliance officer and say, "Hey, something's up. What
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.040]   are the steps we need to do to make sure that this is all okay?" That all goes back to making
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.400]   sure again, having a good trusted contact, having people in place to help you out with
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   these things.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.760]   I do think the first step could be, I agree with you on all those. Outsourcing is the
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.240]   big one, obviously. But just having a conversation, I think money is such a taboo subject. Most
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.480]   people probably don't have those conversations with their kids or vice versa with their parents.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.200]   Taking that first step and having the conversation, saying, "I want to be involved. I want to
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.080]   help," just in case something does happen to one of you or both of you. I think simplicity
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.600]   is the other thing. If you just reduce the number of accounts that you have, don't have
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.800]   accounts all over the place, maybe reduce the number of holdings. If you have fewer
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.680]   funds in your portfolio, I think the simpler the better in terms of the plan and the process.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.220]   I think all that stuff can help too, so it's easier if someone else does have to take over.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:01.260]   But yeah, it's scary to think about this stuff, but people my parents' age, they've got two
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.400]   or three different friends from college that they've known their whole lives who are now
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.520]   in nursing homes because of some sort of Alzheimer's or dementia. This is the kind of thing that
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.880]   you'd never want to see happen to someone you know or love, but it's a real possibility.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:18.000]   Yeah, and a lot of people, you're right. A lot of people, I feel like my parents' generation,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.600]   and I'm generalizing here, so I apologize if I offend anybody, but it's not a generation
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.300]   that really talked about money a lot. Oftentimes, bringing that third party in, whether it be
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.840]   a trustee or a financial advisor, can just help to make those conversations a little
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840]   less emotional.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   Yes, right. Yeah, even outside third party that can look at it objectively, I agree,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.880]   because if you keep it in the family, it can make things tough.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.240]   Yeah, I'm sure whatever emotional issues or cost of setting something like this up, I'm
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:56.400]   sure this person in the example would have gladly spent that either emotional or actual
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.280]   capital to ensure that this didn't happen.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.800]   It seems like in a lot of cases, people wait until it's almost too late, where it's a really
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.820]   awkward or difficult conversation to have. Someone's already having cognitive decline,
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.360]   and so it's kind of like trying to get someone to give up their keys to their car when they're
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.920]   no longer fit to drive. Yeah, it seems like this works so much easier if someone has the
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.720]   forethought to go ahead years in advance and say, "Okay, just in the event something were
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.880]   to happen, I want to go ahead and make sure that this is taken care of," because otherwise
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.440]   it becomes kind of a messy situation, it seems like, or has the potential to become one.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.680]   Right. I've already said it. If I decline cognitively, Michael cannot day trade anything
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.880]   in my portfolio. It's all target date funds. That's it.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.560]   Roger in the chat said that he wanted to make you his POA.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   All right. Bring it, Roger. All right, let's do one more question.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.720]   Last but not least, we have a question from Alex.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.600]   Is the HSA underrated and underdiscussed as a retirement vehicle? The 2023 family max
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.920]   is $7,750. If you use HSA funds for non-healthcare expenses in retirement, those funds are treated
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:12.000]   like a 401(k). No penalty, but you pay income tax. In 2023, a maxed out 401(k) in HSA is
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.640]   over $30,000, a significant sum for tax-deferred retirement investments. The HSA allows you
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.280]   to supplement your 401(k) contributions by another 34%. Obviously, HSA funds used for
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.860]   health-related expenses come out as tax-free as well, which is a huge bonus. But I've never
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.800]   heard anyone discuss the HSA as a second 401(k), given its tax treatment in retirement. Would
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.120]   love to hear your thoughts.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.880]   This is what they call a leading question. I have to be honest, I don't utilize an HSA,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.360]   and for the simple reason that it feels like I have too many accounts already. But I know
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.760]   that there are people who ride or die for these things. So, Kevin, what are your thoughts?
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.760]   My wife has one, so I'm an expert.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.760]   Okay.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   I'm just kidding. I don't understand.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.840]   Ben, you have a bunch of kids. I have a bunch of kids. The HSA is, forget for a retirement
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.040]   vehicle, they're great for young families too. Because as we know, even if you've got
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.920]   great health insurance, that deductible has got to get hit. And if you've got money set
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.600]   aside that comes out of the paycheck every couple of weeks, it's a really nice thing
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:18.440]   to have as a father of three little kids who visit doctor's offices as a sport, apparently.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:26.560]   But to the question around using HSA as a retirement vehicle, I've got a graphic I wanted
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:33.840]   to throw up. John or Duncan, perfect. Thank you. One thing to think about is just that
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.800]   people have it in their minds that retirement is, "Oh, healthcare, the government's going
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:46.280]   to take care of me. It's Medicare. No problems." I don't really have to think about it. Out-of-pocket
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.520]   medical expenses in retirement are a real thing. They're not insignificant. Yes, you
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.180]   get your Part A theoretically free. Again, it depends on where you are with tax brackets.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.520]   But that basically covers if you're in a car wreck and need to go to the hospital. It doesn't
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.840]   cover much else. Then you've got your Part B premium, then you've got your Medigap, then
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:14.320]   you've got your prescription drugs. All that can add up to $13,000, $15,000 a year for
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.040]   a married couple. All of a sudden, you start to think, "Well, $15,000 a year." And even
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.760]   before this recent bout with inflation that we've all been living with, if you looked
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:30.280]   back pre-last year, the things that were inflating the highest, healthcare was one of them. Healthcare
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:37.880]   and education and childcare, which is great. But for a retiree, having a bucket of money
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.040]   that you can say, "Hey, this bucket of money is going to be specifically for my healthcare."
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.440]   I think mentally and emotionally, that makes a lot of sense and gives people some comfort
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.880]   knowing that, "Hey, if there are out-of-pocket costs, I'm not dipping into my 'real' retirement
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   funds."
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.480]   Obviously, it does seem like one of the biggest selling points here is just flexibility. If
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.000]   you need to spend it on healthcare, you can, and it's tax-free dollars. If you want to
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   carry it over and use it for that extra retirement boost, you can too, and that's not a bad option.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.080]   Yeah, exactly. It is flexible. Obviously, the triple tax-free aspect of it, getting
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.520]   a deduction, the money grows tax-free, and then when you pull it out for healthcare needs,
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:28.360]   it's tax-free. That's wonderful. To this person's point, if you don't use it for healthcare
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.440]   issues, yeah, you could use it for retirement. My only pushback on that would potentially
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.600]   just be around why you wouldn't fund other types of accounts, whether it be a backdoor
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.320]   Roth. If you're already maxing your 401(k), it probably means you make too much to do
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.040]   a regular Roth, so maybe a backdoor Roth, or maybe just putting in a regular taxable
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.160]   account that, down the road, you're going to pay long-term capital gains on instead
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.760]   of ordinary income, which you would on the HSA if not used for healthcare.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   Now, even though I bad-mouthed politicians earlier, if someone wants to make me the financial
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.520]   retirement czar, I would just say, "Let's just make these rules generalized to all retirement
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.640]   accounts. Put the HSA, and the 401(k), and the IRA together, and the Roth, and just put
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.320]   it all together. Give them all the same rules. Give everyone the same contribution limit.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.200]   Let's make it easy." I'm getting roasted in the comments here for not having an HSA.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.600]   I just want people to know here, I have a SEP IRA, too, so I'm taking advantage of as
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.400]   many tax deferrals as I can. If I fill that bucket up, maybe I'll look at an HSA sometime.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.360]   - Also, you have a Roth for each of your kids, right? Because they help out with your work.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.720]   - Yeah, right. Something like that. - They're holding the boom above their head.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.240]   - Right, right. - But I can definitely see the benefits of
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:47.120]   the HSA. It makes sense. My daughter had to get braces this year. Could you do dental
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:54.900]   out of this, too? Does that count? - Yeah, yeah. Maybe you can tell, this side
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.520]   of my face is a little puffy because I just had a tooth extracted on Tuesday morning.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.040]   I'm sure that's going to go over the yearly limit on our health care.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.120]   - Should I use some tax-free dollars to pay for my daughter's braces?
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.720]   - Yeah. I got my HSA ready to go for that bill. - The only catch, if there is a catch,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.560]   is that you just have to have a high-deductible insurance plan, right?
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.920]   - Correct. Yep, yep. Exactly. High-deductible health care plan.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.520]   - See your tax return, Duncan. - I wasn't kidding. My wife does have one,
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:28.040]   so I know a little bit about them. - Yeah. High-deductible health care plan. Again,
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:35.920]   I think if you're a young person starting a family, I can't recommend them enough because
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.080]   having children, the actual act of having children is extremely expensive. Raising them
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.440]   is expensive. Doctors are expensive. You never know what's going to come down on you. It's
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.240]   a great thing early in life, and if you don't need it, and some of that money compounds
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.520]   for 35 years, you're in really great shape. - All right. Great questions today. We appreciate
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.680]   everyone who always writes in. It is kind of nice. We get a total diversification of
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.520]   questions. It's always something new that people are keeping us on our toes, right?
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.960]   - They're great questions. I love these. - After this week, I'm anticipating a bunch
