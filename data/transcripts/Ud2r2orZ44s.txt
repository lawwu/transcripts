[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   I mean, it would take you three hours to go from the Rockaways in Brooklyn to somewhere
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.920]   in the northern Bronx, but the roads that Moses built, you can whiz around New York
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.040]   City on these expressways that Moses built.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   The only thing Moses didn't do was the subway, and many people have criticized him because
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.240]   the subways were deteriorated between the time they were built in the early part of
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.920]   the 20th century and 1974 when Carroll wrote The Power Broker, but so had public transit
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.640]   systems all over the United States.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.400]   That trajectory has changed.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.320]   I mean, the steep drop in all these other cities in the Midwest and Northeast, they
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.120]   all declined except New York City, which even though it was way bigger than any of them
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.720]   in 1950, is bigger now than it was then.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   Moses had something to do with that.
