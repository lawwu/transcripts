[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.600]   I'm sure that many of you have also had that same desire.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.160]   There are a couple of places that most of us who have that desire will quickly go.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   Two of them that at least my brothers and I always talked about was vending and car
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.760]   washes.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.560]   Pretty cool, you can just sit down and do nothing and the vending machines make you
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.720]   money 24 hours a day and the car wash makes you money 24 hours a day.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   It's kind of the ultimate dream, right?
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.480]   Well, does it work?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.600]   Today I've invited Matt Miller who's got a world of experience in the vending business
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   on the show and he's going to share with us whether or not it works.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.220]   Of course, you like my tease.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:36.860]   You got to listen to know how well it works.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.740]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.300]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.940]   Like I said, vending, pretty cool business, huh?
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.980]   Well, even though my brothers and I always wanted to do it, I never really wanted to
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.740]   actually buy the machines and take them around and stick the candy machines in everywhere
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.460]   and go and collect quarters.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.460]   So I'm not an expert, but I have found an expert and he's going to share his story with
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.060]   you today.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.260]   My guest is Matt Miller.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.860]   I first met him at the Podcast Movement Conference and it was a serendipitous encounter.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.620]   I hadn't pre-planned to interview him, but after meeting him, I knew that I wanted to
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.460]   bring his story to Radical Personal Finance since it indulges an interest of mine, which
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.460]   is vending.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.020]   He's got a very interesting story he's going to share with you about his experience in
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.460]   the vending business, his own personal finance journey, and then how he's actually gone from
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.500]   having a business of doing vending to setting up a business as a franchise or, I guess I
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.980]   would say franchise or a franchisee, as a person who issues franchises for a vending
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.940]   business.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.860]   It's one of the cool entrepreneurial stories that I think you'll enjoy listening to, how
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.340]   there can be opportunities that are a slight twist on a proven business model.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.020]   That's what I want you to pay attention to as you hear his story.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.100]   Think about the different twists of business models that come out even as he just simply
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.460]   shares his story, how you can take something that other people have done, proven methods,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.340]   in this case it's proven methods of vending, proven methods of franchising, and then you
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.140]   can translate that into something really cool and special.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140]   Sit back.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   Here we go.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.140]   Welcome, Matt, to the show.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.100]   Matt, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.500]   Excited to be here.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.540]   I brought you on today to talk about vending.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.820]   This is probably, for most entrepreneurs I know, people who want to establish a business
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.300]   for themselves and they want to get started and work their way towards financial independence,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.340]   vending, if they don't pursue it, it's at least one of the things that they consider
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.500]   because the dream of being able to go and buy some candy machines and put them out there
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.580]   and they work for you 24 hours a day and you sit back and reap the profits, it's a pretty
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.220]   compelling deal.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.700]   What's your history with the vending business?
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.780]   It's kind of funny.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.980]   I graduated from the Air Force Academy.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.740]   I was an Air Force pilot for nine years.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.540]   I know a lot of people that know me previously, I think, are still probably scratching their
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.540]   heads.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.540]   But you know what?
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.580]   I got out of the military back in 1998, did some work in the corporate world for about
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.420]   11 years.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.820]   About halfway through that, there were just some decisions made early by my boss that
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   made a huge financial impact on my family, not in a good way.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.720]   We went from slowly working ourselves out of taking a pay cut to leave the military
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.260]   to being in a huge hole.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.140]   In fact, I got to a point where I literally got turned down by a payday loan place for
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.460]   a couple hundred bucks that I needed just to pay a bill.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.460]   You don't need a credit rating for that.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.460]   I was going to say, hold on.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.140]   So this is worth talking about.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.420]   On what basis did they turn you out?
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.820]   Because you don't need a credit rating, but you have to bring in your last month's bank
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.180]   statements and there cannot be any dings against you.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.940]   And I had bounced three checks the month prior.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.260]   And so I got turned down by that.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260]   But you know what?
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.860]   During all of that, I knew that it wasn't me.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.980]   I knew it was situational.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.720]   So I didn't take it personally.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.520]   How did you know that?
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520]   What gave you that confidence?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.460]   Because a lot of people struggle with knowing the difference.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.100]   I think it was just my upbringing.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.340]   I think it was the fact that, I mean, let's face it.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.020]   I went to a school that I was one of a thousand that was accepted out of 60,000 that applied.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.540]   I had done some pretty, what the world would say, incredible things and accomplished some
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.500]   stuff that most people could never dream of.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.860]   I mean, when I was 22, 23 years old, government was entrusting me with multimillion dollar
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.540]   airplanes teaching students how to fly.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.300]   So I knew it was a temporary thing.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.140]   It was frustrating though.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.700]   And during that experience, I realized that I could not put all my eggs in one basket.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.780]   And so I was looking.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.060]   I had done some multi-level marketing stuff.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.660]   I had sold books on Amazon and half.com and eBay.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.940]   All those were great and they brought in great money.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.500]   But the challenge was I had read Robert Kiyosaki's book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and I had believed
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   it.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.540]   And so I was not looking just to create an income stream.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.860]   I was looking to create a passive income stream.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.420]   And none of those were.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.100]   So I had a good buddy of mine from church that had mentioned that he and his young daughters
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.600]   had bought some gumball machines and they had something they could do together.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.220]   They had placed them in some local area businesses and he was teaching them about business and
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.540]   about making money and all that.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.520]   And that really resonated with me.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.280]   And so as I was still searching, trying to figure out how to get myself out of this monster
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.860]   hole that I was in with a wife and three kids, I remember that conversation with Damon and
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.100]   I was like, maybe vending's the answer because I couldn't quit what I was doing.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.480]   I needed something to supplement.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.180]   And so I went on Amazon.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.700]   I bought two or three different eBooks over the span of a month's time.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.740]   I educated myself on vending.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.740]   There's a bunch of different vending.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.140]   In fact, when I tell people I'm in vending, most think candy or they think snacks and
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.440]   sodas and that type of thing.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.820]   But the challenge with that is that equipment is very expensive and I didn't have the money.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.140]   And that equipment also, the capacity for those machines is very small.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.660]   So if you get a good location, you are back at least once, if not more frequently on a
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.220]   weekly basis.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.220]   And I couldn't do that.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.340]   I was working full time in the advertising world at the time.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.660]   But bulk vending, candy, gumballs, toys, temporary tattoos, that type of thing.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.460]   The machines were very simple.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.460]   They were mechanical.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.180]   There was no electricity involved.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.180]   And they were very inexpensive.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.820]   In fact, the first machine that I got, I bought on eBay.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:09.380]   It was a two head candy and gumball machine for 32 bucks from a guy that was across Houston
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.380]   that I just happened to find.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.460]   So I didn't even have to pay for shipping.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:18.180]   And so I'll never forget loading up my two oldest kids in my 1998 Honda Accord on a Saturday
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.740]   morning and driving across town to pick up this first machine.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.740]   What year was that?
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.740]   Let's see.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.140]   That would have been about nine years ago.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.140]   So about 2006 or so.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.220]   And man, talk about a humbling experience.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.140]   But I was excited about this stupid little candy machine, you know.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.300]   And we loaded up the car.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.980]   I found out that the guy had 19 others in his garage that he was getting ready to list
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.100]   on eBay.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.220]   And I convinced him to hold on to them and let me come back over the next couple of months
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.100]   and buy every last one of them from him.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:03.540]   So I went home and the next day after work, I started knocking on doors and just went
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:09.000]   business to business to business, trying to find somebody who would have interest in partnering
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.660]   with me, letting me help them raise some money and me make some money as well.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.580]   What was the product that that first machine was going to be selling?
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.500]   One head was gumballs and one was Skittles.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.700]   So the major work of vending, and this is what I've thought about it.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.140]   I worked with a client of mine when I was a financial planner who talked about who actually
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.180]   had a vending business.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.620]   Candy had pretty good business.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.780]   I mean, he was making six figures with his vending business.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.940]   It was pretty impressive.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:47.380]   And as I've considered the business, it seems to me that the challenge is having the number
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.020]   one, well, it's probably two major things.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.220]   Number one, having the courage to go through and fight for the locations because there
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.460]   aren't many places I would imagine at this day and age.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.060]   There aren't many places that don't have a vending machine that just haven't ever thought
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.420]   about it.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.100]   And then number two, building a system where you can efficiently keep them full.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.660]   But it's got to be a tough sales job.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.940]   Well, anything to order nor is tough.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.420]   But the reality is you find out that there's a lot of locations out there that no one ever
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.620]   thought of talking to before that did not have machines or they were just too new to
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.940]   have somebody come by.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.660]   And so, yeah, I probably talked to 20 different restaurants and businesses in my area to find
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.900]   the first one.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.820]   But that really wasn't a whole lot different than what I was doing in the advertising space
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.420]   in the years that I was doing that.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.380]   So I was used to working the numbers.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.660]   And so I got that first machine placed, went back a couple weeks later and it was full
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.320]   of quarters, man.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.100]   And talk about fired up.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.900]   Because I wasn't there.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.540]   And so I took that money, took to the bank, and then I called the guy up across town and
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.360]   said, "Hey, I've got some money for two more machines.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.780]   When can I come and get them?"
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.660]   And I literally built that business on cash flow over a couple of months time because
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.500]   I did not have the money to do it any other way.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.300]   So the first machine cost you $32 and then from then on you bought each additional machine
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.620]   based upon the profits from the first one.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.620]   Yes.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.620]   Yes.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.540]   And then the time to sell and service.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.540]   Yes.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.980]   Now, a lot of people could not be that patient, but I didn't have a choice.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.660]   Now what's kind of interesting, after a while I got kind of bored with just candy and all
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.660]   that.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.060]   I got a Yahoo'd board that I could be a part of and learned a little bit more about the
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.700]   industry.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.620]   And I decided to get involved in the sticker business.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.220]   Well, I had never bought a sticker.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.100]   I had never done anything with those machines, but I was hearing people talk about it.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.460]   And so once again, I went on eBay.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.540]   I found a gentleman in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.660]   Now I was in Houston at the time, that had two brand new machines he had picked up at
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.980]   a trade show.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.100]   The vendors didn't want to ship them back, so they give them away for next to nothing
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.940]   to anybody who will take them.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.620]   And he had had them in his warehouse for a couple of years and never done anything with
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.620]   them.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.300]   Well, I did some research online, found out that each machine was worth about $400.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.060]   Well, I got both of them for $350.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.580]   I picked the one machine that I didn't like the look of.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.900]   I copied and pasted the photo from that machine onto my own eBay listing.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.700]   And before I drove from Houston to Tulsa, I had the second machine sold for the amount
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.500]   of money that it cost me for the two.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.860]   That's awesome.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.500]   So my only cost was to drive to Tulsa.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.340]   And when I got there, the guy was willing to talk to me for about an hour and share
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.220]   some more insights on what he had done.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.300]   He'd been in the industry for years.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:05.120]   And slowly but surely, I picked up and put that puzzle together that has become my knowledge
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   of vending.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:14.780]   Fast forward a year and a half down the road, and I've got 125, 150 locations all across
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.540]   the northern Houston area.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.540]   That's awesome.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.140]   And then '07 and '08 hit.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.820]   And the market tanked, of course, as you're well aware.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.780]   Less people were going out to eat.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.280]   And when they were going out to eat, they weren't allowing little Johnny and little
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.060]   Suzy as many quarters to put in my machines.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.800]   So I was frustrated, and I was trying to figure out a way to increase my revenues and maximize
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.080]   my return for my time.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:48.540]   And at that time, God sent four little kids by my house in the span of a couple of weeks,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.960]   knocking on my door, trying to sell me stuff for the local schools.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.780]   And I was like, "You know, I don't know any of these kids.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.280]   Their parents weren't with them."
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.100]   And as with a dad with young kids at that point, I was like, "There is something really
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.460]   wrong with this picture."
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.260]   Right, right.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.820]   So I started to think about, "Well, maybe I could work something out to tie the whole
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   vending thing together with school fundraising and maybe get little Johnny and Suzy off the
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.820]   street."
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.700]   Well, a good buddy of mine came by about a month later.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.980]   He is an elementary PE teacher.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.780]   And he and his wife came by for dinner one night, and we got to talking.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.560]   And he and I had done some business together previously.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.180]   And I told him what I was doing, or thinking about doing.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.660]   He said, "Matt, let me talk to my principal and my PTO and just run the idea by them and
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.540]   see what they think."
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.260]   And he called me back two weeks later, and he said, "Matt, you're approved.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.860]   Bring a machine."
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.300]   So we set up our first machine.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.180]   We cobbled together custom stickers for that school with their mascot and everything for
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:58.820]   that first location, customized the machine with the signage and all, and began a test.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.620]   And the numbers were phenomenal.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.540]   And the acceptance at the school was amazing because every bit of fundraising they had
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.260]   to do was active.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.100]   They had to get the kids involved, or the parents, or the faculty, or whatever.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.620]   And this was the first passive fundraising they'd ever done.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.220]   And so we had done this test for several months.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.980]   We're excited about it.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.740]   And I was like, "Okay, well, I've kind of validated this.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.100]   Let's go and start to find some others."
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.140]   And I went back to what I was used to, which was knocking on doors.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.900]   And I literally went school by school by school in my area, trying to find other administrators
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.220]   who would be excited about our program.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.540]   And they all kind of patted me on the head like a cute little puppy dog.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.320]   None of them were early adopters, and that's okay.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.100]   Most of them, that's not their personality type.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:53.820]   But I got frustrated again because I had this great idea, but nobody really got it.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.820]   Went online, just so happened that the Texas PTA was having an event two and a half weeks
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.820]   later.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.060]   I contacted their main office.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.140]   They were doing exhibiting.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.780]   They did have space.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.700]   And in two and a half weeks, I scrambled to get a logo together.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.460]   We bought some cheesy t-shirts, someplace that we could get them turned around in a
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.940]   couple of days.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:20.500]   We showed up, we had two spirit stickers, which was our claim to fame, right?
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   Customization.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.620]   We put it on that table and we gave it a whirl.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.460]   My buddy that got me into the school, Jeremy, and then another friend, Shane, that I'd done
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.540]   some business with, I shared with them what I was doing.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.020]   And I taught Shane traditional bulk vending in the previous couple of years.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.220]   And I said, "You guys know my idea.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.580]   Would you guys be willing to split a table?"
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.260]   I couldn't afford to do it all by myself.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.100]   It was like 800 bucks.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.380]   And they said, "Yeah, sure."
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.900]   So we all showed up.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.060]   Had no clue what we were doing, really knew nothing about the PTA.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.940]   And we gave it a whirl.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:06.900]   And we had 10 PTA moms that just could not fathom not having our program in their school.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.020]   And now, we are in Texas.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.260]   There was only three of us.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.180]   But when you do an event like that, they come from everywhere.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.020]   So I was thinking, "Well, the event's in Houston.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.460]   They're going to be right in Houston."
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.580]   No, no.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.340]   Two were from Austin, three were from San Antonio, and five were from the Dallas-Fort
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.340]   Worth area.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.340]   Wow.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.140]   Well, I had a decision to make.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.660]   Are we going to make this work or what?
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.860]   So my buddy, Shane, who was out of San Antonio, took care of the San Antonio and Austin.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.740]   And then I took care of the Dallas-Fort Worth schools.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:46.420]   And I just fit my servicing schedule in with time off and that type of thing.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.820]   And we just kind of got that ball rolling and it snowballed from there.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.340]   How long ago was that PTA meeting?
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.700]   That was seven and a half years ago.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.700]   Wow.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.700]   October next month will be eight years since I put that first machine in.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.460]   It's crazy how time's flown.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.220]   So do you have machines all across the country or just in Texas?
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.180]   Where are you now with your personal business?
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.940]   Well, we've grown a distributor model for years, but we're now a franchise.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.620]   We have a team of about 60 different families in about 24 states right now.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.220]   And we're in about 1,800 or so schools.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.420]   Are you making money?
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.100]   We're doing all right.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.060]   My wife says it keeps me out of trouble.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.940]   And this is your full-time deal now?
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.940]   Yes.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:47.220]   A couple of years ago, I walked away from the corporate gig in the advertising world.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.940]   We bought our first house.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:55.300]   I moved five hours away to Central Texas and I quit my job all at one time.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.340]   And we haven't looked back.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.340]   That's awesome.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.220]   Well, you've moved from the left side of the quadrant to the right side of the quadrant
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.020]   in Kiyosaki's cash flow quadrant.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.940]   So that's awesome.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.740]   It would seem to me that the problem in the vending business, which is why you turned
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.280]   to franchising, which sounds awesome, but it seems to me the problem in the vending
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.960]   business is scale and reach.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.340]   Some businesses could easily expand across multiple states across the country.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.900]   But in the vending business, if you're going to actually manage your machines and you're
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.820]   actually going to manage your employees, you've got to be able to have contact with them and
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.660]   you've got to find people that you can trust.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.100]   You've got to put systems in place to handle the money.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.900]   So it's not a business that scales across multiple states very easily, right?
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.260]   Well, but you know what?
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.940]   I'm on the board of directors of our national organization and I run with a lot of the big
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.340]   vendors in the country.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.220]   And there's a lot of them that cover entire regions of the US.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.100]   But I don't know if you remember ever seeing the Donnie Deutch show on CNN called The Big
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.580]   Idea.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.980]   This was probably eight years ago or so.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:14.620]   Anyway, he had the CEO of the company Coinstar on his show one time.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.220]   I don't even know the guy's name.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.900]   It's not really important except for the fact that he showed up on the show.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.500]   He was dressed to the nines, cuff links, suit, all that stuff.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:30.140]   And I saw that and I made a conscious decision at that point that I did not want to be that
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.300]   guy.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.900]   Because you can be a hundred million plus dollar company.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.060]   They've got all the red box machines and all that stuff now.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.500]   But my guess is the guy works 80 to 90 hours a week.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   And I bought into Kiyosaki's lifestyle.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:52.060]   So I was looking for something that I did not have to own completely and have all the
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.920]   headaches and hassles of.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.260]   So I intentionally took the direction that I did because I know owners treat things completely
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.660]   differently than employees do.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.820]   And I only had to teach people our system one time.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:13.900]   And once they learned it, then they were on their own to grow at whatever pace they chose.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:20.920]   All I had to do is create an environment for them to win and have a proven system in place
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.060]   for them to do it.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:28.740]   And the franchise model is definitely the true owner lifestyle model, which is so cool.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.300]   I mean, you prove your concept out and then you build the franchise.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:38.900]   And as the franchisor, you get to enjoy the leverage of many people's businesses and they
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.500]   get to enjoy the leverage of your proven system.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.660]   Franchising is an amazing concept and I'm so glad it exists.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:53.820]   I want to clarify because I don't fully understand how the stickers relate to the kids.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.980]   The kids are just simply buying the stickers or they're selling the stickers?
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.260]   The kids are buying the stickers.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.260]   Just for their own personal use?
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.220]   For their own personal use.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.540]   Like when we sell NFL stickers, you'll oftentimes, believe it or not, see the dads lined up at
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.900]   the machine when they're coming to pick up their kids because they want their NFL team
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.320]   sticker or whatever.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.100]   But it's primarily geared towards the kids.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.100]   Okay.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.740]   And then so then you just split the revenue with the school.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.020]   And so in exchange for having the machine in there, they take a percentage of it and
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.780]   that raises money for the school.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.060]   And then you deal with the hassle of servicing it, filling it, making sure everything's up
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   to date.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.280]   We do everything.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.300]   They just have to cash the check every month.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.300]   That's awesome.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.620]   Do you have to keep the stickers fresh?
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.060]   Do you have to swap them out all the time or does the same sticker sell continually?
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.060]   No.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.440]   We have to constantly change out the product.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.060]   One of the things that we learned early on is the fact that a lot of the vending industry,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.420]   the product that they offer, they're trying to straddle two different worlds.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.740]   They're trying to straddle the world with the young kids, but they're also trying to
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:02.820]   straddle like the tween teen market as well.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:08.660]   And so because of that, in most series that were produced, there's always that one or
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.220]   two designs that was just edgy enough that we couldn't run it.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:21.740]   So we had to establish exclusive relationships very early on to where I'm a part of the art
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.020]   direction of 90% of what we sell.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.300]   I'm not the artist, but I have ultimate authority on whether we run something or not.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.660]   And everything is geared towards little Johnny who's five years old.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.380]   Because if mom and dad complain, then we're potentially out of business.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:46.500]   And so everything has to be geared to that and most of our product is created specifically
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.680]   because of that.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.420]   So you've spent a lot of years working your tail off.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.240]   Yep.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.080]   What prompted you?
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.220]   What has been giving you the energy to do that?
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.700]   Because it's not easy to work a full time job and then to walk away.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.460]   You had kids and a wife and then not be there at night while you're out knocking on doors
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.740]   of businesses.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.340]   What's driving you?
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:21.260]   I believe that American dream that we were all taught, that we've all heard about.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:28.080]   The rags to riches story, we weren't necessarily rags, but I came from real humble beginnings
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.120]   with my family in Illinois, outside of Chicago.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   And man, I've always wanted to live that life.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.580]   I've always wanted to have total control over what I do, to do what I want to do, not what
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.120]   somebody else tells me to do.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.560]   And the only way for me to do that was to figure out the money side of things.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:56.400]   And today, the reason why I continue to work so hard is number one, I believe I owe that
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:03.440]   to my team to continue to push the limits, to continue to strive to do better, to continue
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.920]   to provide more for them because they've entrusted me and the leadership and the direction of
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.200]   everything that we do.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.600]   So the speed of the group is determined by the speed of the leader, right?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:23.440]   So that's why I'm here, because the only way I get better, which helps me be better for
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.940]   my team and the families that we now support with our business is by me continuing to push
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.420]   forward and not being satisfied.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:38.120]   We have a mantra in our team is that we're all green tomatoes.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.160]   You know, a red tomato is dead.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.720]   A green tomato is alive.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.760]   And so we want to focus as much as we can on being a green tomato and not a red tomato.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.920]   And so that's what my life's about, is learning more, getting around guys like you that can
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:02.440]   make me better, that are smarter in areas with talents that I just don't have.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.480]   And in some cases, learning by osmosis, in some cases, having the opportunity to develop
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:14.680]   significant relationships over time and really get to help one another as we live this life,
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.160]   you know, live the live, the fight, live the challenge.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.560]   It is it's we're not made for sitting down and doing nothing.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.880]   You know, rest is needed, but rest is needed to get back in the battle.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.200]   And and I, I enjoy the fight.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   I enjoy the struggle.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.720]   I enjoy the the challenge.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:42.080]   If you're doing something that you believe is worthwhile, then you can really enjoy the
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.840]   the struggle.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.920]   I would much rather climb into bed at the end of the day, just exhausted and fall asleep
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.560]   knowing that I gave it everything, then just wander through the day and not bother with
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   anything.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   And then you come into the bed and you're disgusted with yourself if you don't do something.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.680]   Now, it does, again, not to say you don't need rest.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.760]   We all need rest.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.920]   Not say you don't need a vacation.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.080]   We do, but rest is not the goal.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.400]   It's just simply the tool to help you reach the goal.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.260]   Yeah, my my parents are both artists.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.320]   My dad is is an amazing woodcarver.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.280]   He could take a picture of you and he could carve a bust that looks exactly like you.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   Wow.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   None of this, you know, woodland stuff.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.520]   I mean, he's amazing.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.240]   My mom's a painter and a she does stained glass.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.040]   She does quilting.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.120]   She's incredible as well.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.080]   They're both teachers and their earlier years before they retired.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.800]   I did not inherit a lick of that creative ability on the artistic front.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.960]   What I inherited is creativity in the business sense.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:53.080]   And I am most alive when I'm helping create something.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.640]   You know, when I'm when I'm coming up with a new idea and then working through the process
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.800]   of launching it and and and creating something new.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.360]   And my ultimate vision is not just sticker vending machines in schools.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:14.900]   My ultimate vision, quite honestly, is to reinvent the fundraising process completely
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.920]   so that the educators in this country no longer have to worry about the fundraising.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.280]   They work with companies like my own, where we have a whole stable of entities that they
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.600]   sign on with us.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.840]   We come in and do our thing behind the scenes and they spend their time doing what they're
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.400]   experts at, which is educating our kids.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.020]   And we come in and employ our expertise on their behalf so that they can do that.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:46.200]   You mentioned a number of failures in a number of very difficult years where you're just
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.040]   really struggling.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.240]   And then over time, you know, things have changed.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.160]   The trajectory has changed.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.960]   Are you able to identify anything in you that changed that made a difference or anything
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.480]   that you did that you were doing previously that you stopped or anything that you weren't
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.840]   doing when things were down that you started doing when things went up?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.160]   Oh, man, a lot of stuff.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.280]   I don't have enough time.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.720]   I used to be an arrogant jerk for one thing, you know, a typical pilot, you know, kind
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.640]   of the whole Tom Cruise Top Gun thing.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   Right.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   I mean, that was me.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.840]   And I hung out with those kind of guys.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.520]   So humility has been a big thing.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.640]   Another big thing has been patience.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.240]   I am inherently very, very impatient.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   I don't know if you're familiar with the disc model of personalities, but I am an off the
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.480]   charts D. So I'm a driver.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:51.060]   And so relatability and empathy and some of those things are not my strong suit at all.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.740]   But one thing that has allowed me to learn patience, as silly as this sounds, is now
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:02.920]   that I have some time to do what I want to do, one of my passions is gardening and to
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.520]   plant that seed and then watch God grow it over a span of weeks or months and to have
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.940]   to be there just as the one that's tending it by watering it and pulling the weeds and
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.760]   all that has really been huge for me.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   It's been therapeutic.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.520]   I get a chance to spend probably four hours a week out in the garden, especially right
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:29.220]   now where we're harvesting tomatoes and squash and all that stuff like there's no tomorrow.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:37.800]   But that has really kind of leveled me as crazy as that sounds and has made me a lot
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.360]   better in the process.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.560]   I also believe that I was put through what I was put through to prepare me to be where
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   I am today.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:53.720]   You know, a lot of people look back on their failures or their lows in their life with
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   regret.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.580]   I don't regret a minute of it because I don't think that I could be doing as successfully
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.760]   what I am today without having been through those lows.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.560]   If you look at a mountain, I went to school in Colorado at the Air Force Academy, had
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.000]   the beautiful mountains right outside my window.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.180]   Well, there's nothing growing on the mountaintop.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.160]   It's all growing in the valley.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.120]   And that's where growth occurs in each and every one of our lives as well, is in the
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.560]   valley.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.160]   And so I'm grateful for those times.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.640]   I don't wish them on anybody, but then again, they were necessary for me to be where I am.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.040]   And that's one of my biggest struggles today as a parent is to make sure that I don't rob
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:42.000]   my kids of those struggles because if they don't have them, they can't grow to become
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.640]   who I believe God has meant for them to be.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   What else?
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.600]   Did you change anything as far as in your daily practices or in your habits?
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   Did you change?
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:59.800]   I've had to become, I mean, I was pretty disciplined already, but I've had to become even more
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.000]   so because when you have total control of your time, as you know, it's real easy for
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.080]   time to get away from you.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:16.520]   And I've wasted my share of time just like anybody, but what I did learn is that just
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.440]   being idle, there's no satisfaction in that whatsoever.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   I mean, tomorrow I'll go and I'll just kind of do nothing most of the day just because
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.080]   this has been a pretty intense weekend with a lot of relationships and a lot going on.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:37.320]   But man, I'm going to be ready to jump right back in the saddle again and figure out how
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:42.920]   I can help the people that I've run into here and figure out ways that these relationships
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.160]   and this knowledge that I've gained here in these last few days can be leveraged to take
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   things to a whole new level and in the process make things better for my team, make things
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:33:00.400]   better for my schools that I serve and improve things hopefully for everybody.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.360]   How did you, let me rephrase.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.440]   Are you passionate about vending?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.240]   No.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.560]   I'm passionate about, see, I tell everybody our business is kind of the unbusiness model,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.760]   meaning I took everything that I liked about corporate America and the military and I kept,
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   but everything that I hated I got rid of.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.080]   They always changed the rules in corporate America and they were never to my favor.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.040]   I was always asked to go to events like this or whatever, but it was just me and my family
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.080]   was left at home.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:45.880]   So in our business, we have another one of our mantras is that families are our foundation
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:51.600]   and we encourage families to be involved, actively involved at all levels of what we
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.580]   do.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.880]   My son Zane is a great example.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.360]   When he was 10 years old, I started my company and I realized graphic design was going to
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.440]   be very expensive and that my business was going to require a lot of it.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:11.520]   So I bought an iMac, I bought the Adobe Photoshop or the Adobe suite and Zane spent two hours
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.080]   working in the art of my good friend Jeff Smith, who's a trained graphic designer and
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.680]   Hollywood commercial editor in exchange for two hours of training on Photoshop and Illustrator.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.720]   Zane at that point became the beginnings of our graphics team.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.280]   Today he leads a team of multiple adults who are all freelancers working for what we do.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:43.840]   He's 19 and he's a sophomore in college and he's had literally nine years of experience
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.200]   as a graphic designer.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:53.660]   And to have the opportunity to allow him to grow at his own pace to do that has been huge,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.720]   but also to see the same thing happen with the kids in a bunch of the different families
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.960]   on our team.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.000]   We've got the second generation now that's getting involved, that we're helping their
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.940]   mom and dad build up their businesses and got excited about the opportunity of doing
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:14.680]   the same thing for themselves and now they are getting started at 18 and 19.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.800]   And in the process we're creating a multi-generational business that is impacting families, it's
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.100]   changing the family tree of families.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:29.040]   I was on the Dave Ramsey show and I know that you think a lot of Dave and got some of your
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.200]   start from listening to him.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.720]   And I had an opportunity about a year and a half ago to ask him a question on his show.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:44.280]   I was at an Entree Leadership event and I started out my question just letting Dave
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.960]   know, "Dave, I wanted to publicly thank you because your message has completely changed
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   my family tree."
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:59.280]   And that's my hope, that's my prayer, is to be able to provide an environment and to
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.800]   provide some insights and some knowledge to some folks that maybe because they're not
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:12.640]   wired the same way had all the tools to go out and start something on their own, but
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.560]   could in a safe and proven environment like we've created.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.120]   But in the process to give them more security over their finances, to give them a lot more
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.600]   options.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:31.120]   Many of them have chosen to do this full time and are living successful lives with our program.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.800]   Many this is just a supplement to allow them to pay some extra bills or to put some kids
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.440]   through school or whatever.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.920]   But for each family to have an environment where they can take what we've done and make
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.480]   it what they want it to be and be a blessing for them and their family along the way.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.840]   It's definitely a privilege and I guess that would be your answer to the passion question.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.280]   I think this is something we don't talk about enough.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.760]   A lot of times I talk a good bit on Radical Personal Finance about passion businesses
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.120]   and lifestyle businesses, do what you love.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   It's quite the mantra.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:13.840]   I mean a gathering like this is over a thousand people here this weekend and I would say 850
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:21.800]   of them, 850 of us are wannabe motivational speakers saying go out and live your passion.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.920]   Problem is I don't believe that passion is the only ingredient that you need and I don't
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.760]   believe that everybody can make a living cooking cupcakes because that's what they love to
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.720]   do or driving Corvettes because that's what they love to do.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.640]   I think some people can but I think some people can make a living driving a race car and some
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.320]   people can make a living working on a race car and some people can make a living practicing
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   law and racing cars on the weekends and that's not the determinant of happiness.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.360]   Passion is not only expressed in the hobbies and in the fun things and frankly, myself
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:59.120]   having had some fun jobs, I realized I don't really necessarily like fun jobs.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:06.200]   I learned, I'm so thankful for a summer, two summers, I taught wakeboarding and water skiing
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.220]   and it was the quintessential fun job.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:14.320]   You show up to work in a pair of board shorts and you drive a boat around the lake and here
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:20.240]   I'm a high school kid and you got girls in bikinis all around and you're teaching them
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   the wakeboard.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.760]   That's a fun job and I hated it because by the end of the summer, it was the same thing
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:35.260]   over and over and over and over and I hated it.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.520]   I learned that fun is not the measure of enjoyable.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:46.720]   Fun is not the measure of passion and you can develop a passion around an activity,
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.640]   sure, and for some people, they're able to do that.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.540]   You can also develop a passion for how you do an activity and you can just be enjoying
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   the process of becoming the best and then you can also develop a passion for the results
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:06.500]   of an activity and that pushes a lot of moms and dads every single day when they don't
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.880]   feel like getting up and they don't feel like going to work and they don't feel like parenting
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.040]   and they don't feel like loving their spouse.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:18.140]   That pushes them because they love the results and in my mind, I'm sure there's many other
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:24.120]   things that can drive the passion but we spend, and I probably am guilty of it, but we spend
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.560]   too much time talking about pursuing the fun passion and not enough time recognizing the
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:35.860]   fact that life is not all about fun and the most fulfilling times of life are not necessarily
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.260]   the most fun times.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.640]   I like to stand on a beach with my wife and snuggle as we watch the sun set but I'll tell
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:48.120]   you the times that have been the most meaningful in our relationship to me have often been
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.900]   very difficult and they've been difficult for various reasons but those are the times
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:00.640]   where our relationship has deepened and I think we do a disservice if we set the expectation
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.960]   to people that the only way to be passionate is to pursue fun.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.480]   No doubt about it.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.140]   My passion really is making a difference.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:18.920]   My coach Aaron Walker, which I think you've had a chance to meet this weekend, his whole
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:24.680]   motivation today is teaching men to go from just success to significance, to having a
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:31.240]   meaning in the world and in the people around them and that's what drives me more than anything,
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:37.480]   not only with our business team and our schools but because I now have control over my time,
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.600]   I work with an organization, I'm on the board of directors, it's called Kids Across Cultures
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:48.160]   and we do a lot of work overseas, primarily in China right now, working with a people
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:55.600]   group called the Hani that is one of the poorest and most remote groups of people on the planet
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.920]   and to go and to be able to spend time with those people and to be able to pour my life
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.320]   into them and help others do the same and to be able to take my kids with me.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.480]   I took my son Zane two years ago, I took my daughter Sarah this last year and I'll take
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:17.600]   my youngest daughter Rebecca this coming year and for them to go and have an opportunity
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:25.480]   to share with some that will never have the opportunity that we have here and to shed
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:31.240]   some light in a really dark part of the world is worth it all.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:37.000]   Have your other kids been involved in the business in any way similar to how Zane has
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   been?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.640]   Oh yeah, I mean before we moved to where we live now, we lived in a 1200 square foot house
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:49.720]   in Kingwood, Texas which is on the northeast side of Houston and we literally for years,
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:56.040]   our living room was a vending machine assembly area.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:02.680]   Our kids would help collate the stickers and they'd help put labels and stamps on postcards
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.560]   that we were sending out.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.120]   My daughter Sarah, the second in line, is now doing a bunch of graphic design work.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.760]   She's even more artistically talented than her brother.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:19.680]   Zane has the computer, the tech talent but she's applying her talents now having learned
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.860]   some of the basics of the Adobe products.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.680]   My youngest, Becca, she helps out with a lot of other things.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.120]   She helps me keep organized, she helps me keep my office clean.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.720]   I've got somebody coming and she'll help me straighten up because my office is kind of
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   organized chaos often times.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.480]   She'll help me with some collating and that type of thing and she's expressed interest
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.080]   in doing some design at some point too.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:56.160]   My goal is for them ultimately to have a skill set and to have an opportunity to pursue their
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.120]   giftings so that when they get to the point where they're out on their own, they can choose
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.560]   to work for somebody if they want but if not, they've been given a lot of the tools and
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:11.920]   the environment that they've grown up in to go out and make their own way and to do it
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:18.880]   their own way without us having given it all to them which I think is a real struggle for
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:27.680]   a lot of us but we really work hard to make sure that they understand the importance of
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:33.240]   hard work and all that because nothing comes for free in this world.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:39.360]   It's a lot of responsibility to have that many lives depending on you.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.480]   Employees, franchisees, children, not easy is it?
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:49.520]   No it's not and that's one reason why I started working with a coach, Aaron, and why I've
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:55.320]   been coming to events like this for the last number of years because I have to stay plugged
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:01.760]   in and you're really a sum of the books that you read and the people that you hang out
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:09.800]   with and so I really strive hard and long to regularly be out of my comfort zone by
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.880]   getting myself around people who make me uncomfortable because they're that much more successful
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:21.960]   or that much more knowledgeable in an area that I'm not and in doing so, it allows me
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:28.760]   to continue to grow and it allows me to continue to earn the opportunity to serve the people
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.600]   that I get a chance to serve.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   Take a minute, tell us about your company, website, your franchise.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.940]   I know you're not allowed to talk about details necessarily but your franchise because that's
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:44.280]   your main focus now is building your franchisees to replicate what you've done here in Texas.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   Correct.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.720]   Talk about that because it might be something that would be helpful for any listeners of
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   this show.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.680]   Yeah, I mean what we're looking for first off is folks that are maybe a little discouraged
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.140]   with their full-time career, kind of like I was, who are looking for a way to take some
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:05.720]   more control and maybe on down the road potentially exercise some more freedom financially.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.760]   Our business, one of its strengths is the fact that it requires a very small time commitment
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.820]   to get started unlike most franchises that are going to expect you to step off the cliff
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:22.180]   and you are 100% having to work within your store or restaurant or what have you.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.360]   Here someone can start our business on just a couple days a month.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.320]   It's very inexpensive to get started, $15,000 to get started.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:37.020]   That's franchise fee coupled with everything you need to get your first five schools up
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.880]   and running.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.160]   We're looking for people literally in just about every state except for Texas today in
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.440]   some way, shape or form.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:55.840]   Our school-facing website is schoolspiritvending.com and though I started the company originally
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.420]   to create temporary tattoos and all that for the high school and junior high market for
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.080]   athletic events and all, they didn't respond to it.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.060]   We do most of our work with elementary schools today.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.980]   Like I said, we're growing like a weed.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:17.600]   We really have found a need and are filling it and schools have responded because of that.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:24.780]   I think the franchise model is definitely something that many, many people should consider.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:34.560]   I just read E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber where he talks about the structure of a business.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.360]   I've experienced as an entrepreneur when I was with Northwestern Mutual, I was an entrepreneur
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.480]   but I was almost an entrepreneur with a franchise.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.760]   I had a contractual agreement with Northwestern Mutual that was similar in many ways to a
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   franchise agreement.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.560]   I was able to represent their products and their services and I also worked with other
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.880]   companies and I was able to represent their products and services but I was given a system
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.920]   for success.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.400]   I wasn't just sent out.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.720]   I was told, "Do these things.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.080]   If you do these things, you will get these results."
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:09.240]   That was such a beautiful thing because I always knew what to do.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.800]   Now, I could decide whether I wanted to do it or not but I couldn't be surprised about
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   the results that I got or not.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.280]   The results were directly tied to doing the things.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.520]   It's no problem if somebody says, "I just don't want to do those things."
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.760]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.880]   You don't have to but this one is not going to work unless you do these things so you've
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.120]   got to do these things.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.800]   That's very different than this business that I'm in now with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.160]   The challenge here, I don't know what things to do and nobody knows what things to do.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   That is tough.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.520]   That's where you are as the franchisor is in developing this, you're on the side of
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.080]   saying, "I don't know what to do.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   I got to figure it out.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.960]   I think I want to go here and let's see if this works.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.560]   Well, let's see if temporary tattoos work.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.560]   Nope, that didn't work.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.920]   Let's see if stickers work.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.040]   Nope, that didn't work.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   You try this design.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.840]   That one didn't work but this one does."
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.960]   That is tough.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.920]   Some days I long for the days when I knew what to do every day.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.960]   If I go in, do these actions, I get this result.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.220]   Life's not like that anymore.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.200]   There are a certain number of people.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.440]   I enjoy it but it is challenging.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.000]   There are a certain number of people I think who should go out and just do their own thing
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.440]   and set something up.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.560]   Those people can take inspiration from what we've talked about.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.720]   There are other people who can look at what they're doing and say, "There are some attributes
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.160]   of this job, attributes of this business that I don't really love.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.320]   I can see some other things."
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.440]   The thing about franchising is, my goodness, pick up Entrepreneur Magazine and you'll find
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.920]   your franchise magazine.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.200]   Just find Franchise Opportunity Magazines.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.600]   As you start to read through them, they can give you exposure to many different types
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.520]   of businesses, whether it's a mobile dog grooming business or a selling stickers in schools
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.240]   business or a selling candy in restaurants business or a rug cleaning business.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.620]   You can start to think, "Would I enjoy the attributes of that?
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.040]   Is there something about that?"
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.360]   And then you can filter through it.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.480]   If appropriate, you do your research on the franchise or you make sure the business model
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.800]   you do carefully, which you do due diligence.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.720]   At least when you sign up, you should, if you've done your due diligence, you should
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.040]   have a model that works.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.960]   And then you just simply don't have to figure it out how to do it.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.760]   You just simply sit down and do it.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   It's powerful.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.040]   Yeah, and we've got eight years track record with what we're doing.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   There's no question that it works.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.200]   Ultimately, it's a question of will that individual work it.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.960]   Like you said, if they're willing to follow our simple recipe for success, what's really
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.760]   cool about this is the fact that I've seen person after person after person after person
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.240]   who is duplicating that to whatever level they choose to.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.800]   And it's cool to see it.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.760]   I loved being an instructor pilot in the Air Force because I could watch this student who
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.960]   knew nothing about flying before they sat down at my desk that first day.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:12.320]   And in a matter of a month and a half, they're going solo in a supersonic airplane.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:17.800]   And a couple months after that, they've gotten their wings and now they're going on to learn
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.000]   to fly whatever airplane they're assigned to.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.120]   There was a lot of gratification in that.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:29.760]   And this duplicates that a lot for me, is to be able to see that growth, to see that
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.840]   change and to provide an environment for people to win.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.980]   Not to do it for them, but to provide the environment and then to watch them grow and
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:44.800]   change and become with us just being a little part of that process.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.320]   When you have some of the things in life that are important to you, when you've got Maslow's
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:54.280]   hierarchy of needs, when you've got the basics of your life squared away, then some of the
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.360]   things that are for other people are more gratifying than some of the things for yourself.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.880]   I mean, from time to time, I get an email from a listener that says, "Joshua, I want
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.260]   to thank you because of you, here's what's happened."
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.000]   I love those emails.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:14.200]   They're so important because I rejoice in many ways more with them than often I do with
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.520]   my own successes.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.560]   It's easier in many ways to rejoice.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.960]   In the position you're in, it definitely, I think, can be a cool place where you can
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:31.080]   rejoice when you see other people able to change from something that's not a good fit
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.740]   to something that is.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.800]   You mentioned your school-facing website, School Spirit Vending.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.640]   I don't think you mentioned your franchise.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:43.680]   It's SSVBusiness.com, School Spirit Vending, SSV Business.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   And Matt@SSVBusiness.com.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   Awesome.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.880]   If folks have interest in talking a little bit more, I would love to talk.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:57.040]   Or if they've just got some questions about vending or whatever, what you'll find with
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.900]   me is this is a very low-pressure deal.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.800]   If it makes sense to you, great.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.680]   If it doesn't, that's okay, too.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.560]   I tell folks my Rice Krispies will be just as crispy tomorrow.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.000]   And in the process, there's no pressure.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.480]   This isn't some hard sell.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.960]   So if it makes sense and you want to talk, I'd love to do so.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.320]   And then check us out and decide for yourself if what we stand for and what we do makes
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.600]   sense for you and your family.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   Awesome.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   Matt, thanks for coming on.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.200]   And I appreciate what you're doing, man.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:31.860]   Of course, we just met yesterday, but I got a chance to listen to a couple of your shows
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.720]   early this morning.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.560]   And man, I'm excited about what you're putting together.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:43.040]   One of these days when I can get it done, I'm going to do some shows about some of the
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.800]   cool financial planning tricks you can use when you're using your kids in your business.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.120]   Because there's some fun things that you can do.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:54.320]   If nothing else, I don't know if you contribute to your son's college education, but pay him.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.320]   And it is deductible.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.880]   I mean, there's just some simple little technical financial planning tricks that you can do.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:06.280]   And when your kids are involved, the rule with kids working in businesses is pay them
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.520]   for actual work they do like you would pay anybody else.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   And that's good for everybody.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.600]   That's good for you, and it's good for them.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:19.180]   And it's also good to be able to use the tax law in your favor.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.080]   The only time it doesn't work is when you pay your nine-year-old daughter $100 an hour
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.320]   for collating the papers in your office.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   That doesn't work.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   Thanks.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.240]   How does the saying go?
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.760]   It ain't easy, but it's certainly worth it.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.800]   That's the sense that I get from Matt's story.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.120]   Love hearing people's stories of struggle and ultimately their triumph.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.460]   Not every struggle ends in triumph, but it's cool when they do.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:50.100]   And I think that the way to guarantee that your struggle doesn't end in triumph is to
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.100]   give up.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.640]   If you don't give up, well, you're still in the struggle and ultimately it's going to
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   end.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.840]   So, give up and try again.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:04.840]   Hopefully, maybe some of you who are listening for whom Matt's vending business opportunity
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.080]   could be a perfect fit for you, might help you to build your own little entrepreneurial
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.920]   thing on a proven system.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.480]   Check out, after the interview, Matt went ahead and set up a special landing page.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.000]   It's linked in the show notes.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.040]   But check out ssvbusiness.com/radical.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.520]   He sent me that over after the show.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   And he's giving away, to entice you to go there and give him your name and email address
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.000]   for his marketing process, he is giving away an e-book entitled, "Live Your Dreams, The
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.400]   Top 10 Reasons Why You Need to Start a Vending Business."
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.720]   So hopefully that can be packed with useful information for you.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   So ssvbusiness.com/radical.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.480]   Do your own due diligence.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.160]   Think carefully, of course, through whether or not it makes sense.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.800]   But I'm sure after listening to this interview, you've gotten a good taste of Matt and what
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.080]   he's doing.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.000]   If the vending business is for you, check that out.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.240]   If the vending business is not for you, learn from Matt's story and just think about how,
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.600]   as I mentioned at the beginning of the show, you can do exactly what he did.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.160]   Take something that works, make a few little tweaks to it to adjust it for a changing market
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   condition.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.080]   Who knows what can happen?
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:13.100]   Obviously, he's still in the middle of building out the franchise business.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.080]   But it sounds exciting to me.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.640]   Sounds like a good product fit for many people at a perfect time.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.960]   Matt, let me know how you're doing as time goes on.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.000]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.960]   I just had a brain, my brain went blank there.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:34.560]   Patrons, patrons, patrons, thank you to especially the many of you who support the show on Patreon.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.600]   That's how the primary way that I pay the bills.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   That's what gives me the ability to have all of my emphasis and my allegiance directly
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.360]   to you, the listening audience, where I'm not beholden to advertisers.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:51.760]   I'm not beholden to just simply support their deal and make, where they don't call the shots,
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   you call the shots.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.280]   If you're not supporting the show, please consider going to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron
