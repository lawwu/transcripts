[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   So a lot of people right now feel controlled by their technology.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   When they're at work it's just email, it's slack, it's zoom,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.560]   all day long jumping from one thing to another. When they get home
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.840]   they're distracted by just a different category
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   of screens. It's social media, it's video games,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.120]   it's streaming. These glowing rectangles are keeping your attention
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.240]   and making you feel as if there is no direction to your life, making you feel
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.760]   low energy, making you feel out of shape and
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.200]   unengaged. So long-time listeners know that my general prescription for this
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.440]   problem is not to try to directly treat the symptoms.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.480]   Don't just go in and say here's my plan for using my phone less.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.920]   Don't just go in and say here are my new rules
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.920]   for my email inbox and I'm going to have an autoresponder and batch my
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.600]   email checks and that's going to fix it. You have to actually solve the root of
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.720]   the problem, which means you have to go in and
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.680]   overhaul systematically your life into something that is so directed and
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.240]   intentional and compelling that the allure of these screens dissipates.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.280]   So you say I am not going to just load up this video game
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.880]   or scroll social media all evening because I have things I want to get to
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.080]   that are more important. I am not going to just sit here on email
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.720]   all day in the office because I'm working on something here
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840]   that matters and that's getting in the way of it. You
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   overhaul your life to be something deep and the allure of the shallows
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.400]   becomes a lot less intense. So I call this approach
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.640]   as you know the deep life. Earlier this year I introduced a
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.600]   step-by-step plan for cultivating a deep life. I called it the deep life stack.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.920]   Since then I have been gathering extensive feedback from you my
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600]   listeners and viewers. I have also been extensively
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.440]   experimenting with this new construction in my own life and I have
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.160]   a major revision. It's what we can call the deep life stack 2.0.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.200]   My new and improved evidence-based approach for how
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.160]   to cultivate a deep life. What you can use as your driving force to
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040]   get away from a world lost in digital distractions and
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   shallows. So here's the plan. Let me just quickly re-motivate. I'll start by
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   quickly re-motivating why this approach of life changing is
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.080]   important. Second I'll review what didn't work
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.600]   about the original deep life stack. So what the feedback told me wasn't quite
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360]   working. And then we'll get into the new deep
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.480]   life stack 2.0. I'll give you your step-by-step instructions for how in a
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.840]   short period of time to make drastic changes to the
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.160]   depth experienced in your own day-to-day existence.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.680]   All right so that's our plan. Let's start by motivating this approach.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.280]   Why do we look at screens too much? Well as I've said before it's often because
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.800]   you are trying to fill a hole. There is some sort of psychic
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   pain that the screen is helping to cover over or obscure. So maybe when you're at
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.120]   home after work there's something about your life you're unhappy about.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.560]   You're saying I'm 30 now, I'm 40 now, I feel like I'm
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.640]   I've lost direction, what's happening here, I don't I don't like what I'm doing,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.400]   I think I could be doing more but I'm not, I feel out of shape, I feel
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   unengaged. Or maybe some specifically hard bad things happen to you and you're
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   having a hard time moving past that. Maybe you just have a
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.320]   really dark view or understanding of the world at the time.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   Screens can be a really good palliative in this case right. It's filling in, I
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.400]   don't want to deal with that psychic pain of these uncomfortable thoughts.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.800]   So I have a video game. I have this Instagram feed I'm going through. I'm
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.840]   just tick-tocking again and again and again and there's there's emotions
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.520]   happening, there's chemicals moving. It's a digital form of what a hundred
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.200]   years ago we would have dealt with with a lot of whiskey at a old-fashioned
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.480]   saloon. And then we're at work there's something similar going on. I mean
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.080]   knowledge work in particular it was such a fast-moving field.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.840]   It's such the wild wild west in terms of systems and processes that a lot of us
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.640]   just look up one day and it's like we're the character in the Mike Judge movie
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.160]   office space where we don't really know exactly what it is we do other than it
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.920]   involves a lot of screens and forms and we're constantly moving around.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.400]   And when that consultant says what would you say you really do here
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.000]   you don't really have a great answer. You strategize and synergize
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.400]   jumping on calls in between your email calendar appointments for the doodle
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.880]   meetings. Just busyness, pseudo productivity. And we
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.120]   don't know what else to do so we just engage in that. I don't know what else
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.040]   work is going to be so at least I'm active.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.320]   And so we just find ourselves on screens all day at work. We're filling
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.000]   in this case the psychic pain from I don't even really know what my job is.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.280]   I'm worried about that. I don't build something I can point to. I don't write
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.960]   something I can point to. So I just need to be really busy and
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.200]   anytime I'm not busy it's a problem. So screen, screen, screens. So solution is
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.080]   something deeper that gets at that psychic pain and gives
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.960]   us something to focus towards that is more motivating.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.840]   Something that will prevent us from being on email all day because it's
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.280]   already clear what it is you need to be doing and you want to get after it and
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.920]   jumping on another zoom call is going to get in the way of it. So you can say with
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.320]   confidence no this is what I'm doing. Judge me by my results. So at home
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.880]   you're not zoning out on social media because there are more
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.080]   appealing and important things you are working on in your life and your quest
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.880]   to have depth and make a difference and that would just be a waste and it's not
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.400]   that interesting anymore to you. It's the psychological equivalent of in
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.840]   the world of health where after having really bad
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.760]   eating habits and you change the way you eat and your exercise and your fitness
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.600]   you look at an oreo that might have before been impossibly appealing and
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.120]   then you look at it after that overhaul and say this seems weird it's chemicals
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.800]   and sugary and I have no interest in it. We won't get to the same place with your
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.480]   screens. So you want to cultivate a deeper life
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.320]   and again this is this was a fundamental understanding for me is that it was
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.480]   difficult for me to be a technology critic without being able to offer to
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.320]   people what it is that they could do instead
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   when they began to unplug themselves from the constant distraction. This took
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.520]   me a while to figure out that you can't just go to people and say
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.040]   being on email and your phone all day is a problem because if you take that away
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   there's nothing else there to replace it. Full anxiety at work what am I doing
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.240]   here? Full anxiety at home I don't want to
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.520]   confront these ideas. That I can't actually talk about things like the
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.960]   hyperactive hive mind and addictive attention engineering the type of things
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.840]   I talk about in my New Yorker articles that I talk
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.600]   about in my my techno criticism talks the type of things I talk about in my
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.800]   interviews and magazines on podcasts. It's hard to just talk about those
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.600]   things without giving people the positive alternative that they should
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   pursue instead. That's where the deep life came out of
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.560]   and that's what we're talking about today. So I invented earlier in the year
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   what we call the deep life stack which was a step-by-step way to cultivate more
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.160]   depth in your life and I think now that I've had some time to think about it it
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.760]   has some problems. But let's start with what that original
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.240]   stack was. For those who are watching instead of just listening I will
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.720]   draw a picture of one of the original stacks on my screen here.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.320]   Again for those who are not watching but just listening everything I'm
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.920]   doing here is beautiful. I'm drawing layers.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.600]   These are the layers of the stack. I'm putting five of them on top of each
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.760]   other. Now there's a couple different small
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.800]   variations of the stack we talked about earlier in the year
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.600]   but they're all basically more or less in this shape. All right I'm now going to
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.680]   write inside each of these layers. At the bottom, the
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.160]   first layer of the stack, the bottom layer,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.040]   we had discipline.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.520]   This was somewhat controversial but this is when I argued you actually have to
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.480]   start by injecting some regular discipline into your life because it
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.680]   changes your self-identity as someone who can do hard things that are important
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.640]   even if you don't want to. Then we had values. Nothing like
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.600]   drawing on an iPad upright to get your best handwriting.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.560]   Values was when you then next moving up the stack from discipline
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.040]   is where you got clear on what was important to you in your life.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.520]   Then you went to service, fixing in your life how you could serve
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.480]   other people who are around you or important to you.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   From there then came organization. It's going to be a long word for a small box.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.840]   You had to get control over what's happening in your life, organize your
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.560]   obligations, organize your time. If you're going to have any hope of
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.840]   actually really aiming your energy in a good direction. Then finally you had
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   vision which is where you get to the fun stuff.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.920]   This is where you build a vision for how to move your life towards something more
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.800]   remarkable. It is when you get to this final stack
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.760]   and the sequence that you do the type of stuff that we like to romanticize like
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.560]   changing your job or moving to a farm somewhere
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.520]   in the country. There's a couple different variations of the stack but
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.200]   they're all more or less something like this. The idea was you moved up the
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.400]   stack in order starting with discipline moving all the way up
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.240]   to vision. What was the problem with this?
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.000]   It's missing some things. Here's what I discovered.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.560]   It's missing explicit mentions of some things that are foundationally important.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.720]   I learned from you my readers and listeners
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   for cultivating depth, physical growth, intellectual growth.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   These were things that we used to talk about on the show when we had the old
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.200]   bucket-based paradigm for the deep life. Keeping your body healthy, keeping your
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.160]   mind engaged. This was not explicitly called out in
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.240]   this particular formulation. What about craft or learning to do
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   things well? This idea of how do you learn to take on
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.760]   something difficult, deliberately practice it and get better at it. This is
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.520]   key to almost any direction for depth but doesn't have its own place
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.240]   in this stack. There is also some pushback on
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.760]   a lack of ambition here. When we get to vision we were talking about
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   overhauling parts of your life but when people think about the deep life
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.360]   zoomed out there's also this notion of some sort of
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   larger scale legacy leaving type of initiative. That's at a scale that was
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.320]   too big for this. Finally, and this was I thought
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.520]   something I found when I was just experimenting with this stack,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.040]   is there's two different related initiatives that are mixed together in
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.840]   this particular stack formulation. There's the initiative where you're
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.760]   getting your life together. Hey quick interruption, if you want my
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.680]   free guide with my seven best ideas on how to
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.440]   cultivate the deep life go to calnewport.com/ideas
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.840]   or click the link right below in the description. This is a great way to take
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.880]   action on the type of things we talk about here
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.760]   on this show. All right let's get back to it.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.160]   Okay if you don't have your life together and a control of things it's
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.520]   hard to do anything values driven or interesting. Then there's
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.720]   the initiative of trying to do really cool things that
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.480]   mark a life as deep. In this stack they're mixed together.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.360]   Discipline, that's sort of getting your life together. Values is part of
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.560]   cultivating a vision of the depth. Organization is
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.040]   about getting your life together. Vision is more about how to cultivate depth and
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.840]   some of the feedback I was getting from my own experimentation is these are
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.760]   maybe two separate endeavors. Get your crap
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.280]   together. Okay I'm done with that. Now we'll turn
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.240]   our attention to how do we aim this somewhere depth. So these were
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.200]   all things that came up when I was looking at
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.160]   the original deep life stack. So we're going to try to fix that with our new
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.720]   version 2.0. Maybe I'll even type that. Let's see
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.080]   here I'm going to actually right on the screen here. Oh my.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.440]   Jesse I have no idea how notability works. Oh I see. You know I've been thrown
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.000]   by, by the way this is not interesting, but I switched my
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.520]   note-taking software. To what? Good notes I think it's called. You
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.480]   switched it off of? Notability I was using to teach my
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   lectures and then it developed some bug where when it was projecting on the
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.880]   screen and I was typing into it, it would continually jump up and down
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.000]   where it was on the screen. So I like the program but it had this weird bug in
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.720]   projection so I had to switch. Huh. All right here we go I'm typing on
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   the screen the deep life, deep life Stacy, the deep life stack
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.040]   version 2.0. All right so what are we going to do here to fix all of those
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.840]   mistakes, not mistakes, but we'll call them shortcomings
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.960]   that we were missing in the prior stack. And let me uh highlight this to show you
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.400]   how good I am. Look at that. I highlighted the word the deep life
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   stack. It looks good. Yeah then look good. Professional operation here.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.120]   All right so how are we going to update the deep life stack, our systematic plan
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.280]   for escaping the shallows. To take in mind those flaws we had with
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.080]   the original version, I'm going to break it
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   into two stages.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:56.080]   So in the the first stage, called stage one, this oh man that's not
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.680]   how you spell stage. Stage one is where you learn to become a
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.960]   capable human being. We're going to make this its own stage.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:13.120]   So we're going to say become a capable human being.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.200]   And we're going to isolate this. Let's do this stage, do everything involved in
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.840]   this stage first before we move on to what we'll call
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.240]   stage two, surprisingly enough, which is then
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.680]   cultivate depth. So we're not going to mix these together
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.560]   anymore. Let's get our act together. Let's become a capable human being
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.560]   or what Jocko Willink called in his book The Code,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.480]   imminently qualified human. I like that. Jocko talks about becoming an imminently
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.920]   qualified human. Well we're going to talk about becoming an imminently capable
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.480]   human being. This is going to have its own collection
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.800]   of four stack layers. Once you're done with that, stage two,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.080]   four more stack layers, cultivate depth on top of that foundation.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.200]   All right so this is the first place we're changing things.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   All right so let's actually draw our four stacks,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   our four stack layers over here for becoming a more capable human being. So
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.720]   we're going to have four here and then four for cultivating depth. You do stage
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.280]   one first, then you do stage two.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.760]   All right so we're going to start as before
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:29.120]   with discipline, but now again this is coming from feedback.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.720]   We are going to specify the three places where we're going to pursue discipline
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.080]   as the foundational layer of the deep life stack.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   That's going to be body, mind, heart.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.080]   So as before, what does it mean discipline? We're going to have you
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.360]   select some keystone habits, habits you return to
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.960]   every single day, habits that you track whether or not you actually
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   accomplish them. They should not be trivial, but they should also be
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.840]   tractable. Unlike before, I'm going to tell you
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.120]   specifically what the three categories are. You should have three habits and
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.040]   they should follow these three categories. Body, you need a fitness
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.320]   habit, something about making your body more
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   healthy. This could be exercise, this could be involving food and drink.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.920]   The second category is mind. This is going to be making your mind
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.240]   sharper. You have an instrument here, but you have to train it how to think. So we
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.720]   need to lay down a foundational habit probably built around reading. It's going
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.920]   to be our best bet here where this becomes a regular part of
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.200]   your life that you're tracking. And then heart by this I mean
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.360]   other people. There's something you're doing on a regular basis and it could
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.680]   just be calling or texting or emailing a
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.240]   different friend or family member every single day.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.600]   It could be checking in with you know your partner or your kids every day and
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.320]   having a conversation with them. Body, mind, heart, keystone habit for
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.880]   each. As we iterate through the stack you can
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.240]   make those challenges harder and harder. So if you're just getting started with
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   this your body habit might be pretty simple.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.880]   It's this 20 minute walk that you do to a coffee store and back each morning
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.920]   followed by 20 push-ups. It might be simple but you're doing it every day.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.200]   As we iterate over time that's going to get more and more
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.280]   potentially aggressive in its ambition. It could eventually end up
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.320]   a really rigorous workout routine for example.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.680]   All right we go from here now straight up
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.720]   to control. This is what we used to call organization.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.640]   Same idea. Control your time. Control your obligations.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   You want to do this right away. Lay down this foundation of discipline. I'm
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.360]   practicing doing things that are important to me that aren't urgent.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.680]   Very next thing you do let's get control of our obligations. Let's get control of
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.840]   our time. This is where you're going to deploy
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.720]   things like my multi-scale planning methodology.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.120]   It's where you're going to deploy things such as full capture. David Allen style
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   full capture. Every obligation is written down in a trusted system not just in your
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.360]   head. Your time block planning your days. Those
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.840]   are based on weekly plans which are based on
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   quarterly plans. No open loops. Nothing you're just keeping track of in your
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.200]   head. You have a plan for your time. You have your obligations captured. You have
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.760]   a plan for executing the obligations that need to be
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   done. There's a big part about becoming a capable human.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.520]   I only have so much energy and time to deploy each day. I want to do so with
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.840]   intention. So I'm moving this right up front
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.360]   in the deep life stack. Right after you got a taste of discipline
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.560]   you're getting your craft together.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.640]   On top of this I'm then going to put craft.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.920]   Just learning how to do something really well.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   This again is going to be at the core of almost any reasonable vision of the deep
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.520]   life is going to be quality. You learning how to do something really
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.640]   well and or you learning how to really
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.040]   appreciate someone else doing something really well
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.720]   but an embrace of craftsmanship and quality. So craft is where you're going
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   to begin practicing two things. One getting better
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.080]   and you could jump right in with a work related skill here.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   As you go through this stack let me choose a skill that I am going to
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.360]   deliberately and systematically improve on but maybe it's going to be a hobby.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.040]   You know I think some of the the more bro oriented
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.960]   really big podcasters that are out there have gotten some flack because they all
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   seem to be picking up the same sort of seemingly
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   anachronistic or arbitrary hobbies such as bow hunting. Why is
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.640]   Joe Rogan and Jocko Willink and all these people bow hunting
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.800]   and it seems so random but you know what there's a logic behind that
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.000]   which is learning to do something really well
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.360]   teaches you how what it takes to do things really well. You can then
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.000]   translate that to other things to come up that are more important. In other
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.560]   words learning even if it's learning how to play guitar or shoot an arrow
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.840]   but systematically building up that skill gives you the type of muscles you need
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   mentally speaking to say okay now when there's something else I want to learn
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.680]   to help transform my career there's something else I want to learn to make a
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.240]   big impact over here you know what that feels like and what
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.720]   that takes. So when it comes to this craft stack when
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   you first get there you're going to learn a skill.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.960]   It could be a hobby it could be professional. I also want you to
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.360]   appreciate other people who do skilled work because that helps motivate you to
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.480]   get better. I write about this a lot of my book
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.200]   coming out in March Slow Productivity this idea of being exposed to people
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.360]   doing really good work makes you want to do really good work so as part of your
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.320]   first time through this craft layer I'm going to recommend that you build
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   up an appreciation of some sort of craft. So I'll put two arrows here get better
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.440]   and then we'll say appreciate better.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.080]   All right so then our final building block we're going to put for the
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.880]   first stage simplification.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:58.080]   Final step to get ready to cultivate depth we got to clear out the dead weight.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.120]   So this is where you go through now that you have some discipline you're in
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.440]   control of your time you have an appreciation for and trust and craft as
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.000]   the way forward now you can say let's start slashing
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.480]   some of these obligations. Let's change the way you know what
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   we're doing at work and I'm going to put all my chips onto this over here and
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.680]   no longer get involved in this or I'm going to simplify or shift laterally to
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.080]   something that's more focused or is more accountable.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.360]   It is also critically where you can do your first attempt to simplify your
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.080]   technological life. It's the first time you can step back
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.520]   and say okay I'm starting to get my feet under me
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.120]   why am I on TikTok all the time? Why am I on Instagram? What tools do I really need
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.920]   here? Maybe I should do some digital minimalism work backwards from what's
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.320]   important to me use those to select value so you can
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.400]   start simplifying out your habits. Like the single most important
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.520]   techno-simplification small step you could take at this step
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.760]   would be let's do phone foyer method. When I'm at home the phone's plugged in.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.400]   If I need to look something up I can go to the phone to look at it. It's not with
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.120]   me when I'm in front of the TV. It's not with me
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.480]   when I'm trying to read. It's not with me at the table when I'm trying to eat
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.920]   dinner. I do not have the option of just looking at that.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.200]   So you could begin to simplify these parts of your life as well.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.120]   All of this sets the stage for stage two which is now let's start cultivating
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.200]   depth on top of this foundation. So we're going to have four
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.160]   boxes over here as well. This is where the fun stuff happens.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.520]   This is where the stuff that catches people at people's attention happens. You
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.960]   do the first stage people are going to say yeah you got your act together.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.480]   Yeah they got their act together. Stage two is where people say wow
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.160]   this person is interesting. All right so I'm going to put as the
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.920]   let me draw arrows by the way so we see the order here.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.120]   Beautifully drawn arrows.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.080]   Bob Ross does happy trees. I do crappy arrows.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:56.000]   All right so first stack layer over here in stage two.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.120]   Now we get to the values. You figure out your code what you're all about.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.320]   You figure out the rituals that connect you
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.520]   on a regular basis to these things you care about.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.840]   This is where if you're religious or interested in being religious is you
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.880]   really lean into that. It's where you really
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.480]   recognize that faith traditions actually depend on
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.760]   action for you to gain insight. You can't just figure out in advance
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.360]   is this religion right. You do the religion and say
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.880]   how does it make me feel. All that happens here. Now this feels really late
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.080]   but again I'm convinced that when you come to
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.640]   these higher order decisions in your life from a
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.040]   foundation of capability it's more meaningful and it's more
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.640]   effective. So I push this later. People often say
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.280]   let's just start with this but if you have no
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.400]   foundation in a code or rituals or a faith-based tradition
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.560]   it's hard to start there. You're throwing darts at a board. You don't even know
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.800]   what you're capable of or have the capacity to follow in a
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.280]   disciplined way what's required to actually gain
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.920]   insight. So let's become capable first. Now we're getting to the bigger stuff. So
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.440]   values now comes next. This is followed by service. You need to
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.120]   be a leader. You need to serve other people.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.280]   Community. Without it you're nothing. Now you're ready to actually be a leader.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.200]   Before you weren't capable enough. You could
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.480]   kind of be a leader but you're going to drop the ball and people weren't you
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.720]   weren't going to have a big effect on people. You weren't going to move the
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.000]   needle. Now you're an exceptionally capable person. Let's put that to work.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.120]   Serve other people. Non-trivial sacrifice on behalf of
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.960]   other people that are important to you. Family, friends, community,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.760]   larger civic society at large. You can move up these layers as far as
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.960]   you want. Make this a key one thing, a tier one
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.560]   thing now that you're starting to work at in your life.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.200]   Then we get transformation. The crazy thing is of all of these stacks this is
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.440]   what the one place most people think when they
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.400]   think about cultivating a deeper life is this one stack.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.920]   Transformations where you make the big values-based changes.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.200]   You get a clear vision of what you want your lifestyle to be like
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.120]   and you begin making concrete changes to move you towards this lifestyle.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.320]   Preferably there's some element of remarkability in these visions.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.080]   It's where you change your job. It's where you move to the countryside.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.920]   It's where you become the surf instructor in Tolfino on the west coast
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.200]   of Vancouver Island. It's where the big kind of cool stuff happens but look at
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.040]   how many layers. How many layers we had to go through. I
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.240]   even have a laser pointer I can show you right.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.040]   All the way up, all the way up before we move to Vancouver Island, before we
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.960]   quit our job because you're not ready for that yet.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   When you're not capable, if you try to make a big change,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.880]   God knows what's going to happen. If you are capable but you're not
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.640]   have a sense of your values, if you're not sacrificing on behalf of other
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.880]   people, filling that deeply social leadership
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.160]   itch that all humans have, then your transformation is going to be
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.040]   shallow. It's going to be selfish. It's not until this point that you're finally
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.320]   ready for that. Then we can add the final thing which is
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.840]   legacy. That's where you begin thinking about
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.400]   what's the impact I want to leave on the world even after
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.240]   I'm gone. The sort of bigger picture orienting mission for
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.960]   your life. This is so big I would say you could probably go all the way through
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.280]   the stack and stop at transformation the first time through.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.480]   You might go through this stack a few times
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.680]   iterating, tweaking, and improving each of these layers before you really get
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.640]   into legacy. You don't have to get there right away.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.360]   In fact you probably aren't ready to get there right away because you haven't
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.960]   done all this other cool stuff yet. So how do all these pieces come together?
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.600]   Well you actually move through this stack and give yourself
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.800]   one to three weeks for each of these layers to get that part of your life
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.600]   going and making sure it's going well. You move your way through the stack
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.520]   you could end the transformation if you want at first. Legacy can come later.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.360]   Then live with this for six months to a year then come back and iterate. All right
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.480]   let's go back to the stack. How are things going with discipline? I want to
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.400]   upcharge this. I want more aggressive physical discipline. I
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.880]   want to do better with my relationships. What's going with control? Well it was
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.960]   going well but I left finances out of there. I want to
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.400]   fix that up. So you iterate six months to a year. You iterate through
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.080]   go through each layer. Give it time to improve what's happening there.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.680]   You iterate every six to twelve months and improve on each of these layers
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.400]   again and again. Each time you make it through to transformation maybe you're
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.120]   thinking about a different thing you want to transform in your life.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.240]   After you've done this five years in a row you may have had several major
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.800]   transformations. You've also tightened up all these other
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.600]   things and now your life is really humming.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.480]   Now the idea that you're just going to go to a cubicle and check email all day
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.120]   and then be on TikTok all evening might seem laughable.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.120]   Maybe you're ready to even really jump into this legacy stack at this point
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.480]   and start to have some really exciting long-term visions about what you're
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.760]   going to leave in the world.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.920]   So this is the DeepLife stack 2.0. Stage one become a more capable human. Stage
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   two cultivate death. Then iterate and repeat, iterate and
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.600]   repeat. As mentioned it seems very far away at
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.880]   first from the the proximate concerns of I'm distracted
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   by my screens but if you don't have a shining destination
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.280]   to aim towards that's more interesting than the glow
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.760]   coming off those pieces of glass those pieces of glass are going to win.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.800]   And so we have to talk about our lives if we're going to talk about
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.640]   our technology. So this is DeepLife stack version 2.0.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.400]   Let me know how it goes with you. You can submit a question or case study or
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.040]   question at thedeeplife.com/listen or you can send us an email at
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.320]   jessie@calnewport.com if you want to tell us about it.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.120]   I'm working with this new version of stack right now in my life. I want to
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.320]   hear about how it goes with you as well. Let's all get deeper
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.800]   together.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.480]   We got to get like a graphic artist Jesse. That's the
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.680]   you got it down though it's from your professor stuff.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.720]   I do write I use a tablet to teach. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.800]   Yeah. So so uh you know I like this is geeky but it's a control control
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.680]   layer of the stack. I really like writing on my
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.560]   remarkable much more than on an iPad. Because remarkable was one of the big
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.720]   things they engineered was friction. So you get friction. iPad's very
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.960]   slippery. There is a way I think to project your
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   remarkable onto a screen. But I like having colors and
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.560]   yeah the other types of things. But that laser pointer was cool. Oh the the other
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.680]   note-taking program I'm using now the laser pointer leaves a trail for a
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.240]   couple seconds. It's like if you circle something it
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.000]   like stays circled for a couple seconds and then it kind of fades out.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.400]   Future is now Jesse. Officially arrived. All right so we got a bunch of questions
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.720]   calls and case studies about all this type of
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.360]   deep life deep work type issues. Before we get there though let us hear
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.720]   from a couple sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.080]   I want to start with our friends at Rhone.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.360]   In particular I want to talk about their commuter
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.720]   collection. The most comfortable breathable and flexible set of products
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.760]   known to man. Rhone helps you get ready for any occasion with this collection.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.600]   It has the world's most comfortable pants, dress shirts,
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   quarter zips and polos so you never have to worry
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.520]   about having the right thing to wear. It is four-way stretch fabric is
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.600]   breathable and flexible. This means it's going to take you
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.080]   everywhere from giving a talk at the boardroom to playing golf or in my case
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.800]   lecturing. I really love the breathable flexible
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.280]   fabric for lecturing where I'm all over the classroom and
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.320]   I'm moving all the time and I am it's hot and
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.600]   I'm in an old building and I want that really light flexible fabric. I really
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.960]   love that. Also if you're traveling it has wrinkle
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   release technology. Wrinkles disappear as you stretch and wear the product so I
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.360]   like bringing the commuter collection with me if I'm
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.520]   going on the road because it's going to look fine coming on my briefcase or my
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.320]   suitcase. I put it on it's not going to get real wrinkly.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.640]   It's also odor free because of their gold fusion anti-odor technology.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.920]   You have a long day you're at a conference all day put on your commuter
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.040]   collection. Look guys if you don't want to think a
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.240]   lot about your wardrobe and you have one of our standard type of knowledge worker
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.560]   jobs it's an easy way to solve your problem.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.960]   Just buy a bunch of Roan commuter collection clothes.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.240]   It has what you need. The commuter collection can get you through any work

[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.280]   comfort. I also want to talk about our friends at
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.560]   Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth's mission is to help you find sanctuary in your daily
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.960]   life. Their luxury bedding and loungewear
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.280]   transforms your life by offering the softest most luxurious and responsibly
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.680]   sourced products in the world. Here's the thing
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.720]   I use Cozy Earth sheets. I love Cozy Earth sheets. I've talked about this on
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.520]   the show. We got a free pair when we were
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.960]   considering taking on Cozy Earth as a sponsor and
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.560]   we liked them so much that my wife and I went and bought several other pairs so
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.040]   that no matter which pair was being or set I guess not a pair set whatever set
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.920]   of sheets was being washed we would always have Cozy Earth sheets on the bed
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.400]   because we hated the weeks when they weren't on the bed.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.760]   That's how much we we love our Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.440]   They're made from viscus which comes from bamboo.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.600]   They're temperature regulating. They feel cool. They only get softer with every
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   wash. I really love it. My wife even bought Cozy Earth.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.360]   You can get like shorts and loungewear so you can have the feel of those really
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.160]   comfortable sheets when you're just sitting around and not even
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.680]   in bed. So they got this 100% viscose bamboo fabric which feels fantastic. It
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.720]   regulates temperature. Easy to wash in the machine. Durable.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.520]   And they pride themselves Cozy Earth prides themselves in ethical production
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.560]   of all their products. And here's the thing all
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.640]   Cozy Earth products can be returned or exchanged within 100 days
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   and they include a additional 10-year warranty against defects so you can try
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.720]   these with no questions asked.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.080]   They have also been included in Oprah's favorite things five years in a row.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.440]   Jesse you think we should start a Cal's favorite things?
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.560]   Yeah. I think we as popular as Oprah's. Yeah. Problem is I'm so like curmudgeonly
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.400]   and don't really buy a lot of stuff. So it'd be like a list of 25 books
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.320]   and like Cozy Earth sheets and a pen. Oh and the seltzer water you you get us
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.200]   for the studio. And the remarkable. The remarkable and the cherry flavored
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.040]   pollen spring seltzer water. Jesse keeps our fridge stocked with a very particular
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.760]   type of seltzer water so that would be. I think it'd be as popular as Oprah's.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.680]   Oh man. Anyways. So here's my gift for you.

[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.400]   Yeah and also CozyEarth sheets. That'll be my favorite things.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.080]   All right let's enough of that let's do some questions.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.520]   Who do we have first? All right first question is from Alan.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.640]   I'm always excited to see how you guys how you answer these questions because
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.600]   I'm always sure but this one I'm excited about.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.800]   Interesting. It seems like prioritizing deep work
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.480]   means that to-do list can only increase as time passes because
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   deep work can never be completed faster than shall work.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.280]   If you agree that this is true how should we respond to this reality?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.040]   I think we have a couple questions like this this week. That when we're thinking
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.800]   about deep work as part of the our vision of the deep life
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.160]   it comes to mean some pretty weird things for people.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:24.880]   It becomes this um amorphous extra demanding
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.360]   almost like selfish commitment that's in addition to all of your other normal
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.760]   work. It comes through that way so you hear a
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.320]   question like this it's like well if I'm doing deep work
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.680]   uh then that's taking away time for all these shallow tasks people need me to do
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.800]   that those will pile up. Here's the thing about deep work it's not
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.160]   an extra thing you add on your plate it is an
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.480]   approach to how you execute the things that are already on your plate.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.760]   If you have a non-entry level job in knowledge work there are some things
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.000]   that are cognitively demanding like writing a report or analyzing data
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.560]   or coming up with a new marketing campaign there's some things you do that
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.920]   are not so cognitively demanding it's you know answering emails or filling out
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.800]   forms. What's the right way to do the
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.960]   cognitively demanding stuff? The deep work
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.200]   hypothesis says you should give it your full attention
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.920]   so you're working on something cognitively demanding give it your full
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.640]   attention and you'll be able to do it faster and
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.000]   better than if you instead interleave your cognitively demanding task with the
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.920]   shallower task. If you keep going back and forth
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.200]   it slows everything down. So to say I I'm committed to deep work it doesn't
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   mean I am now adding to my job these extra activities I call deep work it
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.840]   just says I'm going to be much more aware of how I tackle my work. I'll do
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   the shallow stuff all together deep work all together
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.000]   it'll all take less time. So your to-do list will get smaller
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.080]   if you context shift left less and better segregate
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.640]   different types of cognitive demands in your daily schedule.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.000]   All right so deep work is not some extra thing you're adding to your normal life
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.960]   it's a way of taking what you're already doing in your working life
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.880]   and doing it more efficiently and doing it better.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.960]   Man the deep deep work really becomes a boogeyman for people sometimes.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.600]   Yeah it's like you know I'd love to do deep work
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.000]   but I have to feed my children or something you know like people are like
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.520]   uh it's this thing I think people see it as like some ritual where you put on a
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.840]   hood and like your kids are crying hungry at
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.160]   home because you're around the fire in the woods with your hood like chanting
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.400]   uh making chants about whatever Hemingway's writing strategies I mean
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.440]   it's weird it it represents for a lot of people a lot
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   of stuff that I think it's kind of boring I mean it's
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.760]   don't switch your attention back and forth when working on the hard stuff
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.600]   you'll do it faster and it'll be better. Yeah.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.720]   It's a better way to do the hard stuff than to switch it back and forth.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.200]   All right well we got let's do I think the next question is similar so let's
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.800]   handle that one. Yep next question is from Eric. I want
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.320]   to ascend to a management position in order to have more complex challenges
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.440]   and responsibilities. I've been told that I need to work on
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.640]   my soft skills. Are deep work principles potentially
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.160]   harmful to collaborate the soft skills needed to get to the next level
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:07.120]   and that they encourage a monk-like individualistic approach to work?
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.200]   Well as I point out clearly in the book Deep Work I say okay
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.720]   principle one of deep work uh when you're working you now have to make
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.560]   a a long pilgrimage to a monastery or a monastic-like
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.880]   location. It needs to be not unlike Luke Skywalker
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.280]   that island he goes to in whatever that Star Wars movie is where they filmed it
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.640]   on Skellig Island in Ireland. So you're on some deserted island where you need
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.320]   to go and you need to be wearing a robe and you need to be there minimum and I
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.680]   just want to be realistic here minimum 135 days
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.760]   and during that time you may not speak or communicate with the outside world.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.640]   You can drink warm water and bread crust as all of your attention
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.000]   is focused on just summoning summoning from the spiritual depths
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.760]   the excel spreadsheet that you're trying to write. So yes I mean if you're going
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.040]   to do deep work we're talking about hundreds of days living on Skellig
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.520]   Island eating only bread crust because that's what the principles demand.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.920]   Now clearly I'm being very very very sarcastic because again
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.280]   deep work is about how do you handle cognitively demanding tasks when working
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.760]   on those tasks give them your full focus don't context switch back and forth.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.640]   Now I think this is actually relevant here because there's a flip side to it
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.120]   that if you're giving work let me categorize my work into
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   different types of cognitive categories so I can
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.960]   tackle work each type of work with the right
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.680]   type of environment or approach it goes the other way as well. So the
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.880]   flip side of okay when I'm working on this complicated excel spreadsheet I'm
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.360]   just going to focus just on that without context switching.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.280]   The flip side is okay but then when it comes time to do talk to people in the
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.640]   office let me give that my full attention and just focus on the soft
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.560]   skills and doing that really well. Let me consolidate all of the sort of
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.240]   walking around and talking to people and planning so that I'm not doing that in a
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.680]   a harried way in between other hard things or I'm just trying to clear my
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.040]   inbox. I can actually give the attention necessary to come sit down with people
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.880]   look them in their eye. So when you give each type of task its
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.680]   own time and therefore you can treat each type of task in the way that it
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.440]   best needs to be treated. You do everything better. So not just
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.880]   deep work stuff gets done better but the soft skill stuff can get done
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.000]   better as well. And the logistical stuff it's less
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.600]   mistakes and it goes faster. Okay this is the time I'm doing logistical stuff
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.040]   now that's all I'm doing I'm in that context and I can I can go quicker and I
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.920]   can build some systems and and I can realize I don't need to do
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.240]   this. I mean everything is better when it's done
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.080]   in its own context and not all mixed together and that's really what's being
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.200]   pushed for in deep work is the cognitively demanding stuff
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.000]   needs to be isolated from the other stuff.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.240]   And you need to do that because it's the stuff that ultimately is going to
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.800]   matter in your career more to almost anything else because if you're not
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.040]   producing something valuable then where is your value for the organization.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.480]   So have a equivalent to the deep work mindset for your soft skills is what I
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.240]   would ultimately advise here. I actually talked to someone I know let
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.760]   me be very specific here who did this recently this exact situation
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.600]   Eric I forgot I forgot the name of the person asked the question Eric
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.960]   someone I know was telling me about this the other day where they got this
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.920]   specific feedback they're very good at the skills they the
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.480]   cognitively demanding skills to do they weren't their soft skills
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.520]   were lacking yeah you got to talk you got to be
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.160]   uh better connected to the people in the office 30-man office
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.240]   so he got systematic about it and I don't remember all the details but I
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   believe he was doing something like um he was working remotely most days and
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.120]   I was like actually I'm going to come into the office three days a week
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.880]   and every time I come into the office these people this is a checklist this
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.120]   is the way I would handle it too I'm very introverted I'm going to talk to
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.840]   each of these three people I'm going to have a conversation with them
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.600]   and yeah it's a checklist that I'm coming into the office these days and
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.000]   during this time I'm going to go talk to people
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.760]   but day after day week after week those soft skills are getting better those
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.040]   relationships are getting better so by giving each type of task its own
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.520]   isolated context where you can tackle that task
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.800]   with exactly what that task needs to be done well you can get better at all the
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.600]   different parts of your job so not just your deep work gets better but your soft
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.000]   skills get better your logistical work gets done faster
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   you find more efficiencies so no deep work will not keep you from your soft
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.640]   skills treat it with the same respect that you
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.160]   treat the the cognitively demanding work and I think you'll do better
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   I could probably use some soft skills help professors are not known
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.120]   for soft skills because we have no feedback function
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.320]   well you talk to the students all the time that's true but we don't have to be
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.120]   good at that I mean we don't have a feedback function
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.880]   right so if you're like a normal job and acted in the way let's say
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.240]   50 percent of professors act in a faculty meeting the boss would be like
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.240]   my god you're fired this is this is a crazy way to behave as
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.600]   like a grown adult but you have tenure you're a professor there's no feedback
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.400]   function right you're not being hired so there's no one
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.280]   to fire you so people just get weirder and weirder professors get strange
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.080]   let's put it that way not all I think I'm a pretty normal guy but we get
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.200]   strange let's be honest all right let's keep rolling here
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.760]   all right next question is from josh how do I deal with having to stop working on
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.160]   something that is still in progress and not a clean checkpoint and not at a
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.680]   clean checkpoint in my job I work on longer term less
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.520]   well-defined larger tasks which means that on many days I find at the end of
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.680]   the day when I'm still very much in the middle
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.000]   of solving a particular problem I'm stuck and don't know what to do
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.680]   josh I feel your pain on this because I was in that same spot
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.960]   earlier in my career the same spot where I found myself with
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.320]   essentially endless cognitively demanding work to do that had no clean
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.120]   shutdown points and the evenings were difficult the
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.400]   particular spot where this happened for me and I remember this clearly is when I
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.000]   was working on my doctoral dissertation at MIT it's a very large sort of
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.280]   mathematical project and I made the in retrospect maybe not so smart
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.600]   decision that when it came to my doctoral
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.400]   dissertation I was going to do all new work
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.880]   so typically in computer science if you're a doctoral student you're
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.480]   publishing a lot of papers and I was and when your dissertation comes around
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.120]   you're taking you know these five papers in which I explored this theme I'm going
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   to build my thesis around it I didn't do that I said I already wrote
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.400]   those papers I want to do something new so my doctoral dissertation was all new
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.880]   mathematics I was doing from scratch because I thought it would be boring
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.360]   just to go back and stitch together papers I already did
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:35.520]   so it was uh happening again and again I would get to the end of the day I'd be
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.680]   in the middle of a proof like the big thing for me is
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.240]   I'm not getting this proof to work really hard to shut down there
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.480]   because imagine the train of thought I don't have this proof working
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.080]   what if I never get this proof to work if this proof doesn't work
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.200]   this whole approach for this chapter my thesis will fall apart
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.440]   if I don't have that chapter I'm not going to be able to submit this thesis
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.320]   I'm not going to get my degree you could see how the do
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.360]   right down the line so I was like man I need some way
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.760]   of quieting my brain when I'm ready to stop working for the day
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.600]   there was very rarely would I finish a nice proof at five o'clock
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.280]   that is when I invented my shutdown ritual the shutdown ritual we talk about
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.560]   all the time on this show the shutdown ritual that is encoded into my time
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.520]   block planner the shutdown ritual that I talked about
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.320]   in my book deep work I invented it for exactly this issue so
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.240]   there's two aspects to a shutdown ritual one I think is the more common
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.040]   thing we talk about and it's going to be less relevant for you Josh but that's
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.440]   the thing where you just close open loops this is
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.200]   was there stuff that came up today that I need to write down or put on my
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.000]   calendar is there like an urgent email I need to answer
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.720]   it's the making sure there's not something that you're just keeping track
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.520]   of only in your mind you get that all into a system
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.160]   it's where you check on your plan for the next day like okay everything is
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.920]   good I'm not missing something but the other aspect of my shutdown
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.360]   ritual which was very big for me then but I don't talk about as much now
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.880]   was reflecting on the work in progress putting a cap on it for the day okay
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.720]   here's where I am here's where I'm stuck here is two things
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.440]   I'm going to try tomorrow that might get me unstuck
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.360]   doing that work which could take anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.440]   and when I shut down the work it's not that I had solved it but I had
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   built from scratch a hasty checkpoint I this isn't working but let me write
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.200]   down I remember so clearly writing down here's why this is not
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.080]   working you know the summation has a xenos paradox issue here are two things
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.440]   I might look at tomorrow go read the the proof from such and such
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.840]   paper they did something similar maybe there's something there that could help
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.360]   me or see if there's you know talk to so and so about if there's like a simple
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.400]   uh concentration bound I could put here instead like you write down a couple
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.360]   things you could do you can't do them right now they're take an hour or so but
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.960]   you're writing them this is what I'm gonna do next
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.840]   that's all you need to get a clean checkpoint and your brain says okay
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.760]   we know where we are we have a plan we'll get back to that plan tomorrow
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.280]   it's just as good starting that plan in the morning as it is doing it right now
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.880]   and it will release that ongoing work in fact it's not even a bad thing to do
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.400]   this it's I mean it's not okay I'm dealing with a bad situation
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.600]   it's a bad situation that I'm not at a clean checkpoint and I have to invent
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.320]   this hasty checkpoint I wish it didn't have to happen but it
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.760]   did that's actually not the situation it's beneficial
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.080]   to have these hastily created checkpoints a lot of writers do this
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.440]   we joked about Hemingway earlier but but this is something that Hemingway
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.040]   himself actually did is he liked to be in the middle if he
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.080]   was in a role writing kind of in the middle of a paragraph
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.800]   even in the middle of a sentence and shut off
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.640]   so that the next day he'd be picking up in the middle of something where there
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.360]   was some momentum that was already going he could just read up to that point and
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   get going much easier place to start than at the
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.480]   start of a new chapter so if anything what you're going to get
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.920]   by stopping in the middle of ongoing work
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.320]   is a fresh legs or fresh arm the next morning
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.880]   so you're going to be able to continue working on that with a fresh brain
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.520]   instead of trying to drag it through and perhaps some unconscious processing
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.640]   you've clarified the problem what you're going to work on you're not thinking
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.040]   about it because you have a clear shutdown routine but your brain might
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.320]   in the background and you get there the next morning you're like man actually
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.640]   yeah this works pretty well so see this as a feature not a bug do a
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.080]   clean shutdown routine every day work is done when the shutdown routine has been
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.560]   completed if your mind bothers you say i'm not
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.360]   going to get into your rumination we're not going to think about work because we
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.120]   did the routine i'll see you in the morning
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.400]   that routine should close open loops but also create temporary checkpoints
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   where needed here's where i'm stuck here's i'm going
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.600]   to work on the next day let your mind take a breather you'll hit the ground
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.800]   running the next day josh it saved me so much anxiety that it turned off made
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.080]   the rest of my ill-fated decision to write a dissertation from scratch
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.320]   a little bit less onerous i was also writing a book at this time
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.920]   don't get me started the shutdown ritual really helped
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.280]   so add that component to it josh i think you'll find it's going to uh it's going
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   to make a big difference
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.680]   all right let's see we have some calls right yeah all right i'm excited about
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.880]   calls uh here we go
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.360]   hey cal an issue that i often have during periods of deep work or attempted
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.400]   deep work is um dealing with intrusive thoughts
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.480]   about you know other things that i could be
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.080]   doing with my time so i might be reading an academic paper
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.280]   and you know these thoughts keep popping in my head like oh i
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.040]   should be working out or i should be practicing piano and
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.520]   it just feels that i'm always um you know thinking about the next task or
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.800]   something else that i should be doing so i don't know if part of the problem
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.160]   is that i haven't you know properly prioritize my
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.080]   activities during the day but um you know it i would describe it
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.320]   almost as fomo for all my uh given given tasks and
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.760]   activities in a day so just curious what you know your
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.480]   thoughts are and um you know if this is something that's
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.600]   common for people trying to engage in deep work thank you i'm glad you
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.360]   bring you bring this up because i i think it's a common issue
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.600]   that we don't talk about enough we talk about here's the mechanisms you use to
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.080]   plan your day but we don't necessarily talk about well
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.320]   how do you figure out the plan for your day
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.600]   that's almost always a given right like yeah you know what to do it's just a
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.840]   matter of sort of marshaling your activity better
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.040]   it's actually really hard especially when you're new to it
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.560]   especially if you're a student or you're new to the working world
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.240]   it's an endless array of things that you're trying to pull from
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.560]   both in work and both in life outside of your work and this idea of
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:39.040]   productivity fomo if i can coin a term is a real one so there's two different
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.360]   parts to my answer here one is just clarity right so i have a
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.800]   time block plan for my day that gives you clarity you thought
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.600]   about the plan you made the plan now your mind says it's not my job to do
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.320]   any more planning my job for the rest of the day is to
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.000]   execute this plan so clarity really helps that's why i'm a
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.520]   big proponent of time block planners it's why i have college students do
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.640]   this where they schedule out all the school work they're going to do on a
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.600]   regular basis i don't want you planning any more than
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.360]   you have to 10 minutes in the morning should be enough
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.280]   that's fine here's my plan and then all you're focusing on
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.560]   is following the plan the best you can fixing it if you need to
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.200]   so when you're writing the paper you're writing or reading the paper like in
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.840]   your example you're doing so because that's what the current block says on
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.040]   your schedule doesn't say work out workout is later
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.160]   it's not on this day now if you couple time block planning
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.120]   with weekly planning if you couple the weekly planning with
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.480]   quarterly or semester planning then you're going to get even more
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.520]   confidence in your clarity because you're looking at multiple time scales
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.000]   because your weekly plan is where you figured out here's when i'm going to
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.720]   work out this week so that when you get the tuesday and
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.360]   it's tuesday at 3 30 and you're writing your paper
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.160]   there's no reason for you to say should i be working out right now because you
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.560]   already know you're working out on monday wednesday and friday when you're
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.720]   doing it that's a part of your weekly plan
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.840]   and when you have the bigger picture FOMO like should i be uh
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.960]   working on a different research topic why am i even reading these papers
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.800]   your quarterly plan kicks in says no that's what i'm doing this season
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.080]   we're trying to learn this area of machine learning and see if we can write
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.720]   a paper and we'll check in at the end of the season
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.320]   so clarity at multiple scales gives you confidence in the moment
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.760]   of the thing i'm doing is as reasonable a thing as there is to do i don't need to
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.240]   be thinking about it again right now the second thing i want to throw in here
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.480]   is grace grace for yourself you say yeah i'm
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.360]   building a reasonable plan i want to execute it
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.720]   maybe it's the best maybe it's not sometimes we better than others
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.320]   sometimes it's a dead end it's okay i don't have to be a scheduling
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.600]   genius i'm not you know pushing 10 in an air
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.280]   traffic control center somewhere where if i make a mistake a 747 is going to
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.000]   crash into the golden gate bridge you're building a schedule for a college
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.400]   student you're building one week schedule for a 40 year career you're
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.120]   going to have in the world of work so you you do your
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.880]   best with multi-scale planning some some days are no better than others
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.120]   some plans will work better than others you'll get better at it through
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.840]   experience and just give yourself some grace
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.000]   the binary flip here that matters is reactive
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.960]   proactive disorganized intentional that's the binary flip you should be
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.680]   proud of i'm marshalling my energy i'm not letting it dissipate randomly or
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.120]   in other people's agendas i have a plan at different scales i do
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.520]   my best to execute it sometimes better than others
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.240]   the plans will get better as i go along and now i've done my shutdown routine
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.600]   and i'm gonna have a margarita get out of my face you know you just can relax a
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.240]   little bit about it so clarity plus grace and just trust over
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.880]   time you'll you'll be fine you'll get you'll do better at this
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.800]   just by having a plan at all you're doing much better than
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.000]   98 of the other people around you you're going to get that
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.600]   cumulative it's like having you know aggregate
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.640]   compounding interest over time that advantage is going to build and build
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.640]   and build 20 years in your career you're just
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.880]   going to have control over everything where other people are still bouncing
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.480]   around frenetically from thing to thing and mad at everyone everything's not
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.320]   fair you're just going to be like i control my life
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.760]   you know you're going to have compounding interest of that intentional
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.200]   aim of your energy even if it's not always super accurate
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.640]   is better than random dissipation so it's a good question i'm glad you asked
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:24.000]   it clarity plus grace you'll be fine we have another call we have another call
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   two call show yep two calls here we go
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.720]   hi cal i'm brett i'm an adjunct instructor at a private university in
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.200]   the southeastern united states and a long-time
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.520]   acolyte of your approach to productivity i'm hoping you can answer this question
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.200]   with the speed of hermes you've mentioned the working memory dot
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.600]   text file you use for impromptu ideas while concentrating on other work
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.520]   the question do you clear out everything in this file every day
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.280]   and start new the next day or is the file a semi-permanent collection of
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.000]   those ideas a good question also good greek reference
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.880]   just see i don't know if our new listeners know about this
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.240]   no i mean that's this is like a deep hole
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.280]   back when i used to do the call-in show once a week
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.200]   um i don't know how to describe it other than the callers back when we did a lot
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.960]   of calls decided that the more superfluous
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.360]   references to greek mythology the better so this is like a pull from the past i
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.240]   really do appreciate that it makes no sense to people listening now but that's
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.200]   okay that's between us and the uh the old timers
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.480]   also a really good question um if i'm able to do a full shutdown which
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.520]   is my goal almost every day some days i don't get
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.160]   there part of my shutdown routine is clearing my working memory dot txt
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.720]   so i am a huge believer of the working text working memory dot txt file just
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.480]   have a blank unformatted text file on your desktop
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.720]   that you add to things throughout your day no
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.680]   matter what you're doing is where you offload stuff out of your
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.800]   brain temporarily because you can only store so many things
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.360]   you're on a call that's where you're taking notes you're you're going through
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.200]   your inbox it's where you're writing the the things over here like the dates you
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.000]   go to your calendar and then you can see if those dates are free
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.840]   you're creating a task list for a task block you do it right there
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.040]   you're you're copying text that you're going to paste into something else you
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.160]   copy it into the working memory dot txt it's the most useful
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.600]   most commonly used digital tool i uh in my life
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.880]   in terms of my professional life and it's a it's a blank text file but yes
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.560]   you should clear it down to empty this is an extension of your brain it is not
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   a storage system it's not a planning system
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.760]   you should have a separate place to keep track of obligations your priority
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.400]   obligation list you should have a calendar for appointments
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.920]   you should have planning documents for plans planners
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.760]   daily planners for daily plans it's not it's not part of your permanent storage
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.120]   uh systems think of it as like sand that's going to get shaken
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.360]   fresh at the end of every day and monica can use that when she's
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.040]   in deep work sessions too right yeah yeah yeah so if you have thoughts during
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.600]   deep work sessions like oh what about this what about that
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.560]   uh it's a great use for it drop drop drop drop drop and then once you're done
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.680]   with your deep work session and and shutting it down you can process hey
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.960]   what did i write down during the session yeah it's a fantastic tool all right
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.520]   let's uh let's do a case study i've done one of
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.640]   these or we've been doing these more recently is what i mean to say we have
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.680]   done these more recently a case study is where one of you my
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:19.360]   listener sends in a story of how they've been using this advice in their
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.800]   specific details of their own life this case study comes from logan
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.520]   logan says my wife and i moved from suburbs the suburbs of the denver metro
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.040]   area to build a house on my parents land in
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.240]   the foothills in a relatively rural environment
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.000]   we did this to have a deeper life and focus on raising our children in a slow
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.560]   and outdoor environment there's a lot of interesting deep life
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.920]   related trade-offs that went into making that choice but the actual interesting
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.800]   case study to me relates to slow productivity
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:55.280]   in order to reduce cost and be able to afford the house
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.480]   build without a mortgage we reduced the contractor scope
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.600]   to stop at texture drywall with us doing uh painting final electric final
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.520]   plumbing flooring door install cabinets kitchen all
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.640]   the trim ourselves an avid listener of your show i decided last minute to take
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.000]   a slow productivity approach that is for the month of april i am
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.280]   taking two hours off of work every day and have drastically reduced my other
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.240]   hobbies and commitments this has enabled me to get about four hours of
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.680]   construction done each day with my wife helping for two to three of
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.720]   that granted we are only halfway through april as i write this but i'm shocked
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.080]   and pleased at how much progress we have been able to make with this approach
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.040]   and how little exhaustion or burnout i have felt consider me a slow
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.240]   productivity convert one thing at a time no individual day
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.560]   is incredibly important and let the results
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:45.280]   stack up i love this because it is an example that is relevant to the
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.360]   world of work that's coming from the world
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.760]   outside of work the world of housework this is a very common experience among
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.480]   people who do big projects outside of their professional life
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.280]   man it was so fulfilling to just work slowly but steadily on this thing
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.520]   and i really love the way that logan described this no day is important
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.200]   but every day adds up so it's not there's no stress
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.880]   in this particular wednesday i'm spending three hours working on trim you
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.440]   could be sick and not do trim for three hours on that wednesday
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.960]   nothing bad happens but you have enough of those wednesdays and all the trim
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.440]   gets done and you have this concrete accomplishment
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.600]   that is what we are wired to appreciate as humans
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.880]   the slow sustainable aggregation of effort towards
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.160]   well-done high quality results that we're proud of
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   now fast forward to the typical computer knowledge work job
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.240]   it's the opposite all day long frenetic back and forth activity we've taken all
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.240]   these different projects that we interleave with each other and we're
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.200]   just trying to keep the plate spinning by answering this email and sitting off
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.680]   this just in turn you can respond to this and jumping on zoom over here and
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.720]   back and forth and it's just as frenetic i can't even
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.280]   tell you all the things i'm working on i'm barely working on it work has been
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.480]   devolved to like emails back and forth or sometimes some
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.160]   you know decisions get made in a meeting and some drastic writing it is the
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.040]   opposite of the slow but sustainable work it's not slow it's very fast it's
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.240]   not clearly defined we have multiple things that we have
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:12.480]   unspecified roles on that are they're coming in and out of our scope of
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.560]   activity and it's not sustainable if i if i'm
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   sick and i have these hidden projects i'm
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.680]   emailing all day it's a real big issue everything grinds to a halt
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.880]   so it's a constant source this sort of background anxiety
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.560]   so logan working on his house is the epitome of slow productivity my idea
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.320]   this is the idea of my book slow productivity that comes out in march
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.080]   is we need to port this over to work the world of our jobs the world of
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.480]   knowledge work this is what work should be
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.920]   slowly but steadily on wildly important stuff
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.800]   it's like this is what we're wired to do it's how you can maximize the value
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   produced for yourself and for the world we're so far from that right now and we
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.520]   shouldn't be so i really appreciate that case study
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.160]   logan slow productivity is the future i'm really
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.960]   excited for my book to come out too because i want to talk a lot more about
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.160]   it i want all these details to be out there so we can go big
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.880]   on slow productivity all right we have a final segment coming up i want to react
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.920]   to something i read about that i thought was quite interesting but first let's
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.840]   hear from another sponsor
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.080]   from billion dollar ad budgets and arena naming rights to tens of thousands of
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.960]   retail locations big wireless providers spend big
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.080]   to appear like they're your only option how do they afford it all
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:30.960]   that big bill you get every month mint mobile has a different idea instead
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.920]   of brick and mortar overhead mint mobile is on the line
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.320]   only what does this mean for you savings because wireless plans for mint
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.120]   mobile start at just 15 a month that's unlimited talk text and data
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.800]   for just 15 a month by getting rid of all that
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.720]   bloated overhead they can give you what you need which is talk and text and
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.800]   internet service for cheap mint mobile solved the big
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.960]   problem i had i needed a bat phone a sort of a simple flip phone that i
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.560]   could use to stay in emergency contact in places where i didn't want my full
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.680]   smartphone uh you can't just add to one of your big
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.120]   wireless plans as sort of a simple smartphone they want you to spend huge
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.680]   amounts of money and upgrade your whatever and have the laser beam folding
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.880]   uh iphone 97 or whatever they're doing now
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.000]   so i just bought a flip phone on amazon for like 40 bucks

[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.160]   that came across on the internet or in my email inbox in
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.120]   particular i want to talk about a book the book that came out in february but
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.080]   it's proven popular the author has done a lot of interviews so
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.280]   people have been sending me clips of this author very interesting
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.800]   story very interesting book i want to talk about some of the ideas in
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.200]   the book and give you maybe my own take on these same themes which is a
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   little bit different than where he comes down
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.320]   so i'll load the book here up on the screen for those who
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.200]   are watching at home the book is called burn

[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.240]   potential is written by matt higgins who has a really cool story

[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.720]   in this gripping rags to riches instant classic matt higgins provides the
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.440]   blueprint he used to go from a desperate 16 year old high school dropout
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.800]   caring for a sick mother in queens new york to a shark on shark tank and the
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.560]   faculty of harvard business school told with raw
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.600]   emotion radical transparency higgins writes the definitive tome on the oldest
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.800]   life hack in history burn the boats
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.960]   from sun tzu to julius caesar the ancient israelites to ukrainian
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.360]   president vladimir zalinsky was vladimir zalinsky i say that wrong
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.480]   there's a bold and highly effective tactic seen throughout history when
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.280]   leaders want to motivate their troops for success they destroy all
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.880]   opportunities for retreat and fully commit to the mission
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.680]   they burn their boats its win or perish and the clarity of sheer desperation
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.280]   propels them to victory skipping ahead here the
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.040]   book jacket says burn the boats is the manifesto for
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.840]   anyone looking to level up their life while navigating risk each chapter
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.640]   includes clear actual advice that readers can immediately start applying
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.360]   to their own lives this book will give you the courage to
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.120]   confidently go all in on your life's true purpose so matt has a he's a very
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.560]   impressive guy and has a very cool story really came out of a hard situation to a
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.160]   lot of success and he used this idea and he's been telling this idea a lot
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.800]   and he's been getting a lot of play so i wanted to talk about this because
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:53.520]   a very similar concept came up as a major theme when i was working on my
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.960]   2012 book so good they can't ignore you
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.000]   so so good they can't ignore you was a book that was looking at career advice
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.960]   and so the idea that i was in uh engaging with from the world of
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.680]   career advice in so good they can't ignore you one of the big ideas i was
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.120]   engaging with is what i called courage culture
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.800]   and at the time so this is the the 2000s the first decade of the 2000s when i was
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.000]   working on this courage culture had a really big
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.320]   footprint in the career advice space and that the theory behind courage culture
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.960]   was straightforward it said the most important thing
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.360]   in terms of transforming your work into something that you're passionate about
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.800]   is having the courage to go after that thing you love
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.240]   so courage culture uh prioritizes courage as the the key issue so look i'm
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.960]   going to draw a picture here and again my apologies for people who
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   who are actually seeing this um but but in courage culture i'll draw this this
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.040]   rough picture um what it's saying is okay the the the
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.600]   path all right so i'm drawing a squiggly line here at the end of the squiggly
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.840]   line is a person smiling jesse will tell you
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.800]   for the listeners expertly drawn holding their hands in the air
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.440]   triumphantly um and what is the what is the obstacle
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.600]   here is you have this this obstacle up front this big
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.120]   jude is like a red squiggle and it's fear
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.400]   so this great illustration on the screen so courage culture said here's the issue
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.360]   is if you can overcome that fear which is
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.120]   built and there's all sorts of sources of it
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.720]   parental expectation conformity to society
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.400]   you can overcome that fear you have a pretty easy path to being very happy
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.000]   so we have to build up courage to find happiness i push
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.240]   back on this as i went out there and i studied people who
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.440]   were very passionate about their careers and i studied their actual lives not
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.760]   just what they said and what i saw was a different picture
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.160]   so the path that they took if you're looking at the uh
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:59.520]   screen now you'll see this the path they took was uh
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.160]   uphill so now my picture it's a pretty arduous
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.000]   uphill path right so it's like going up a mountain
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.600]   and so what is uh what is stopping them here
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.000]   so what's in the way of this uphill path is an expertly drawn
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.600]   brain oh god i'm getting creative here jesse
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.320]   an expertly drawn brain that is seen oh man changing color this is
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.960]   getting my i'm really impressed by my drawing uh
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.280]   is seen as drawn by these orange dots
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.640]   the hardness of this path
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.320]   and saying okay i'm going to preserve energy
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.920]   pretty good right jesse yeah it's great all right
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.800]   so if you look at these two different interpretations you get two different
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.600]   ways to go forward so courage culture says this first picture is what's
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.240]   happening so you got just get really inspired so
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.720]   you have this moment of courage and overcome your fear
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.600]   and once you leap over to the other side you have this easy path that was
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.080]   waiting there all along just going to get you to happiness
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.880]   this other uh approach which i said was more realistic is the reason why you're
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   you're hesitating to get going is that often it is really really hard to get
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.840]   the success with something really cool and
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.800]   your brain recognizes that and it sees how hard it is
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.560]   and it says hey buddy i like the guy at the top of the mountain
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.480]   with their hands in the air but you're not ready to do this
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.760]   you don't really understand how to hike this long
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.240]   you don't know how your compass works you don't have enough water i checked
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.120]   your boots they're pretty bad you haven't checked the weather do you
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.360]   have a jacket and so your brain says we're not going to engage on this
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.040]   long-term plan until i'm more confident that you know
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.480]   what the hell you're doing now last week on the show we got into
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.000]   the neuroscience of this this actual process is called episodic
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.160]   future thinking or eft it is your brain actually trying to
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.040]   project into the future and understanding of what's going to happen
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.400]   based on your experience and expertise that you already have stored in your
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.200]   hippocampus and seeing what it projects and if it
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.640]   likes what it projects then it's going to give you motivation
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.320]   and if it doesn't it's going to withhold it so if when your brain that the
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.600]   centers that are working on the eft the episodic future thinking are looking at
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.560]   what you understand and your plans and your past experiences and says you don't
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.880]   know how to get up that proverbial mountain you're not going to get
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.640]   motivation so my approach was it's not about getting
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.240]   the courage to just go for it it's filling up that hippocampus with
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.520]   enough evidence-based expertise and understanding of what you want to do
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.760]   that your brain when it projects in the future says yeah i
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.480]   see how this is going to happen that's cool we're going to get up that
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.040]   mountain that guy's hands in the air that's going to be us that
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.240]   ties to our values let's get after it and you're not at war with your brain
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.600]   you're co-opting your brain to get on your side
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.000]   i think we we over emphasize this idea of part of ourselves being afraid and
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.840]   we're trying to overcome that i think we've we've given that too much power
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.040]   and we have not given in our culture enough power to
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   how effective eft really is at helping us make decisions about what to do in
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.600]   the future and when we switch our attention from
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.160]   the courage culture to the episodic future
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.920]   thinking approach it really changes the way we
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.760]   the way we strategize to go after something cool
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.640]   we don't burn the boats we say how quickly can we learn enough about this
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.600]   make enough little bets get enough expertise talk to people who know what
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.920]   they're doing how quickly can we convince our brain that this is
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.640]   something we can do there's still a little courage after that
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.320]   that might be required if what you want to do is quite different
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.720]   than what's expected people are correct to point out as they
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.320]   did when i was researching my book that you know it could be hard
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.000]   don't leave your law job don't leave your tenure track position don't become
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.320]   an artist when you should become a doctor you know that that is hard but
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.080]   not nearly as hard as we think when your mind is on board with a plan
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.200]   that leads to something that's true to its values it takes a little courage to
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.240]   tell your parent i'm not going to med school
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.240]   but it's not as much as you think if your brain is really on board with the
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.960]   alternative that you're going to do so this idea that you're going to burn
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.840]   your boat so you have no plan b that that's going to motivate you
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.120]   motivation doesn't get you up the hill equipment does skill does training does
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.240]   so you're you should not be looking to get rid of plan b's
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.040]   you should be looking instead to build better plan a's
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.640]   a little bit of courage might still be involved but it's not going to be that
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.960]   hard if you've gotten your mind on your side
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.880]   so see your mind not as an arbitrary obstacle but as your ally
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.560]   it is really good at saying hey do we have a good plan for what we're doing
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.800]   that's why humans are so successful as a
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.920]   species it's why we can invent things and build the pyramids and everything
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.560]   else we've done trust a human brain don't avoid plan b
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.800]   write a better plan a that's uh that's what i have i have seen
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.440]   to be successful i don't know if you remember that
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.040]   rhetoric from like the 90s and 2000s jesse but man it was
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.640]   everywhere you see it a lot in sports too
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.400]   yeah i just have the courage to go for it yeah yeah well it's
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.240]   okay can i i'm going to bring up an old man rant
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.200]   this nothing makes me seem older than this i've said it before on the show but
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.080]   i'm going to bring it up again cars three the pixar movie
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.160]   cars three because the the whole plot line of cars three
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:28.480]   centers on the fact that the the one car anthropomorphic car who's helping
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.280]   whatever his name is lightning mcqueen lightning mcqueen
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.160]   um train for his return because so lightning mcqueen's an old style stock
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.280]   car and now they have these new uh sort of
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.480]   computer design cars they're just faster it's better technology
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.000]   and he's going to train like i want to train to like overcome these
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.520]   technologically more superior calls cars the the whole plot line is the
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.440]   person training you know lightning was someone she always
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.240]   wanted i don't know how you gender a car but
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.080]   whatever it's a she in the show um she had always wanted to be a race car
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.200]   driver but had you know didn't have the courage to do it because
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.960]   you know i i guess she was a girl car i don't know how this i don't know how car
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.920]   gender works um so that was kind of the plot line
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.320]   like okay that's you know that's interesting right there's this interesting
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.520]   dynamic of like this is something she always wanted to do but couldn't
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.160]   um and now she's helping this other person do it the way the movie ends
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.440]   is they're on the racetrack and there's a super computer design cars
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.120]   lightning mcqueen by the way is like was one of the top stock car racers like top
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.280]   of the heap before this new technology came in
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.240]   so like whole life training to do this and at the very end the uh the the
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.880]   trainer gets the courage to say i'm just going to get on the track i don't care
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.920]   what people tell me i'm gonna race and she beats all the high tech cars
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.320]   no training no like how did how did her old technology overcome it no
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.240]   like so it was the courage culture personified that the only thing that was
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.520]   holding you back from beating these like super precision
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.080]   cars that had been trained this really well was just having the courage to
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.400]   compete for it and they're completely missing the part
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.880]   where you actually have to become good good at the thing so it was like courage
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.800]   culture personified was the trainer from cars three
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:12.160]   beating the high tech hyper cars because she had the courage to actually get on
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.800]   the track like what message are we teaching
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.240]   what message are we teaching kids it's like rookie of the year you know like the
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.880]   secret you could be pitching in the major leagues it's if you broke your arm
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.800]   in a weird way then that's it and then you're gonna
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.960]   you can't throw 100 mile per hour fastball it's like where's the training
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.680]   so i'll tell you i mean i stood up and gave that room full of kids in that
