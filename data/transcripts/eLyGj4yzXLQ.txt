[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   [silence]
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.120]   What I'd like to discuss next, I find extremely exciting.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.960]   Why?
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.600]   Well, what I'm about to describe is a compound
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.360]   or I should say a set of compounds
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.680]   that are available over the counter
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.240]   that have been shown to be very effective
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.720]   in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.080]   And not just one kind of headache,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.660]   but multiple types of headaches.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.580]   So what I'll describe has been shown
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.160]   to have significant effects in reducing the intensity
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.480]   or frequency of tension type headaches,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.800]   migraine type headaches, as well as hormone type headaches
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.480]   that are related to the menstrual cycles
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.680]   that I described earlier.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.000]   Now, there are a lot of data
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200]   centered around this general topic,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.740]   but I'm going to focus on three main papers.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.280]   What I haven't told you yet, of course,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   is what is the compound that I'm referring to?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   What is this over-the-counter compound?
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.300]   Well, it turns out this over-the-counter compound
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.040]   is not just available over the counter,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.140]   it's also available in food.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.320]   So it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.480]   on the frequency and intensity of headache,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.080]   although supplementation with this particular compound
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.980]   can accomplish the same thing as well.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.600]   What I'm referring to here are omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700]   Many of you are probably familiar
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.960]   with omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.400]   These are fatty acids that come in the form
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760]   of so-called EPA and DHA.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.580]   And omega-3 fatty acids are commonly distinguished
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.640]   from the so-called omega-6 fatty acids.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.160]   Omega-6 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods,
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   and they, of course, can be supplemented as well.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.240]   Omega-3 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   and can be supplemented as well.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.060]   Common forms of omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.980]   or I should say common sources of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980]   in foods include fatty ocean fish,
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.280]   including salmon, salmon skins, sardines, anchovies,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.960]   things of that sort.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.200]   Common sources in supplement form are so-called fish oil,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.160]   capsules, or liquid fish oil.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.880]   Again, omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.880]   And almost always when we're talking
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.240]   about omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.880]   we're talking about a combination of EPA and DHA,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   but really it is the quantity of EPA omega-3 fatty acids
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.640]   that seems to be the most impactful
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.960]   for the sorts of health metrics
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.420]   that we're going to talk about in a few minutes.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.680]   Now, with respect to omega-6 fatty acids,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.040]   the most typical food sources
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.560]   of omega-6 fatty acids are seed oils.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280]   I know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.080]   I've given my stance on this in a prior podcast,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.200]   but I'll just repeat it for those of you
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.320]   that haven't heard it.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.560]   I am not of the belief that all seed oils are bad,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.280]   that they're all inflammatory,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.600]   that they are killing us or making us sick,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.880]   that they are the major cause
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.320]   of metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   However, I think it is very clear,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720]   and I learned this from Dr. Lane Norton
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.200]   when he was a guest on this podcast
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.160]   and taught us all about nutrition in great depth.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.680]   I highly recommend that episode
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.200]   if you're interested in nutrition,
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   that people are consuming a lot more oil generally.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.920]   And a lot of those oils
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.680]   that people are consuming more of nowadays
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.080]   include a lot of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.200]   And a lot of those oils are seed oils.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   The particular omega-6 fatty acid
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800]   that's going to be relevant for today's discussion
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.520]   is linoleic acid.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.720]   And that is common in a lot of seed oils.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.880]   So again, I'm not going to tell you
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.960]   that seed oils are bad.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.680]   However, it does seem to be the case
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.240]   that many people are consuming far too many seed oils,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.680]   and in doing so are consuming far too many calories,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   and perhaps are consuming too much
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   of the omega-6 fatty acids
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.280]   relative to the omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   Now, with that said,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.640]   I think there is general agreement
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.720]   among nutritionists and health professionals
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.000]   that we could all stand to get more omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520]   perhaps for cardiovascular health,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.880]   although that's a little bit debated,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.680]   but certainly for immune system function,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   for mood, and for functioning of the brain,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   and for the potent anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.500]   So again, omega-3s can be sourced from food,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.900]   both animal-based and plant-based.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.060]   You can simply go online
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.320]   and look up the various food-based sources.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.120]   But in thinking about headache
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.240]   and different treatments for headache,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.920]   there are some recent studies exploring
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.520]   how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.540]   and in one case,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.560]   how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.100]   and deliberately reducing the amount of linoleic acid,
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.760]   the omega-6 fatty acids,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440]   how that can impact headache.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.960]   So the first study I'd like to describe
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.080]   in reference to the role of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.880]   in headache was published in 2018,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.040]   and the title of the paper is
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.520]   Long-Chain Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Headache
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.880]   in the U.S. Population.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.720]   There are a number of things
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.240]   that I really like about this study.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.800]   A few of those include the fact
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.160]   that they looked at an enormous number of people.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   That is, they included 12,317 men and women.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.400]   I like the fact that they included men and women
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.560]   in the study, age 20 or older,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.720]   and that they broke down the population
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.840]   into categories that included age.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   They certainly looked at race and ethnicity.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.360]   They looked at educational background.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   They looked at body mass, total energy intake,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   which is really important.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.780]   If you think about it,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.280]   people are going to be eating,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.400]   and within the things that they eat,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.560]   they're going to be consuming some omega-3s, hopefully,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.120]   as well as some omega-6s.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.200]   And if they're eating far more,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.480]   then they're going to get far more of,
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.760]   likely going to get far more of both of those things
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.700]   than they would ordinarily
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.080]   if they were eating a smaller amount.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.480]   So they controlled for total caloric intake
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.920]   in a way that I find particularly useful
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.480]   for looking at these kind of data.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.100]   So the reason they explored omega-3s is worth mentioning.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.040]   Omega-3 fatty acids are known to have
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.960]   an anti-inflammatory effect.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.060]   That anti-inflammatory effect is mediated
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.300]   through a couple of different pathways.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.460]   We won't go into these in too much detail now,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.180]   but the omega-3 fatty acids, keep in mind,
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.140]   actually make up various parts of cells
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.380]   in the brain and body.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.220]   That's right.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.260]   The membrane that, remember I talked before
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.700]   about how steroid hormones can go through
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.860]   the different membranes of the cells,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.640]   the outer membrane and the inner membrane,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.180]   a lot of those actual membranes,
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.660]   the structural constituents of neurons and other cells
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.120]   are actually made up of or include certain fatty acid,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.440]   long chain fatty acids.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.520]   And the omega-3 fatty acids are important
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.160]   for the actual construction of those tissues,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.760]   as well as having anti-inflammatory effects
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.720]   through things like limiting prostaglandins
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.560]   and other things that can cause inflammation.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.820]   Okay, so there are a bunch of different ways
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.260]   that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.240]   They refer in this study to an earlier study
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.200]   that looked at the so-called analgesic effect,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.520]   the pain relieving effect.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.560]   Analgesic means pain relieving effect
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.760]   of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.980]   in what had been a randomized control trial.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.480]   And in that previous paper,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.140]   what they found was that diets high in omega-3s
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.720]   and low in omega-6s.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.320]   Okay, so high three, low six.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   And as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.620]   they found a greater analgesic effect
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.000]   of increasing omega-3s
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.280]   while also reducing omega-6 fatty acids.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.640]   So in the context of the seed oil discussion,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.160]   although keeping in mind that omega-6s
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.200]   can come from other sources as well,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.780]   if omega-6s were just reduced on their own,
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.280]   there wasn't as great an effect
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   in terms of reducing pain and inflammation
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.040]   as there was when omega-3 fatty acids
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.240]   were deliberately increased
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   and omega-6 fatty acids were reduced.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.120]   Again, in all of these studies,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.080]   because these are the ones
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.720]   in which they controlled things well, as we say,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   they are holding constant the caloric intake.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.760]   So it's not just that you're removing fat, eating less fat,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.720]   there's actually a removal of certain fats and fatty acids
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   and a replacement of those with omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.040]   In one case, in the other case,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.240]   it's just a reduction in omega-6s
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.700]   and you're using other food types and macronutrients
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.100]   to offset that reduction in calories
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.920]   caused by reducing omega-6s.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.120]   The basic takeaway that they're relying on
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.120]   marching into the study
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.540]   is that increasing omega-3s and reducing omega-6s
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.520]   seems to be beneficial for reducing pain.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.960]   And indeed, in this study,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.800]   they find something quite similar,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.280]   which is that when you hold caloric intake constant
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.600]   and when you look at omega-6s,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.760]   whether or not you decrease omega-6 fatty acids or not,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   you find is that increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.240]   so either consumed through food sources
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.620]   or by supplementation,
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.460]   was associated with a lower prevalence
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.360]   of severe headache or migraine.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.220]   So severe tension type headache or migraine.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.440]   So this is promising and points to the fact
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.720]   that long-chain omega-3 fatty acids
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.980]   are likely to have either a pain-reducing,
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.520]   and there's evidence for that,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   and/or an inflammation-reducing effect
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.660]   that can significantly reduce the severity of headache
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.160]   in both tension type headache and in migraine.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.440]   So that's the first study.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.120]   The second study is a more recent study,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.920]   it was published in 2021,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.840]   that used a, I would say,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.540]   a more or less similar type of overall design
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.360]   as the one I referred to earlier.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.480]   The title of this paper is
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.520]   "Dietary Alteration of," what they call N3,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.120]   but those are omega-3 and N6, omega-6,
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.720]   sorry for the shift in nomenclature,
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.280]   I didn't write the paper,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   "Dietary Alteration of Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.440]   for Headache Reductions in Adults with Migraine."
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.940]   And this was a randomized control trial.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.280]   Randomized control trials involve
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.040]   having people be in one condition,
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.920]   where they do one thing,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.880]   and then they get swapped randomly into another condition.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.040]   So they serve as their own internal control,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   and that controls for all sorts of things
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.120]   like differences in sex, differences in age,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.820]   differences in health background,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.280]   and any number of other variables as best as one can.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.460]   In this study, they had people either ingest a diet
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.460]   that had increased omega-3s, so increased EPA and DHA,
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.760]   or increased EPA and DHA
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.680]   and reduced amounts of linoleic acid, okay?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.540]   So that's going to reduce omega-6s.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.560]   Or a control diet in which they had people taking,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.240]   well, it's essentially the average intake of omega-3s
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.360]   and omega-6s.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.800]   And you can probably already guess
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.360]   what the general results of this study are going to be.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.680]   The general results were
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.260]   that there were reductions in headaches, okay?
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.520]   The really cool thing is,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.520]   is it was a massive reduction in headache, okay?
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.600]   They refer to it as a robust reduction in headache,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.680]   in particular for the subjects
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.280]   that increased their omega-3s
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.840]   and reduced the amount of linoleic acid that they took.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.880]   The other thing that I really like about this study
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.040]   is that while they don't know
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.800]   the exact underlying mechanism for the effect,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   they did spend some time delineating what it is
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.160]   that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.400]   are likely doing to either offset or exacerbate headache.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.440]   Now, I didn't say that omega-6 fatty acids
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.840]   exacerbate headache,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.800]   but it does seem that people who ingest more linoleic acid
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.400]   and omega-6 are experiencing more inflammation.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.800]   And that is evident in a bunch of different conditions.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.120]   One, for instance, is increases in things like CGRP.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.640]   CGRP is a molecule
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.800]   that's associated with a calcium signaling pathway.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.600]   It's involved in vasodilation,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.960]   the expansion of the blood vessels and capillaries.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   And that's known, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.760]   to exacerbate certain forms of headache, okay?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.920]   There are also forms of headache
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.480]   that can be caused by vasoconstriction.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.220]   We'll talk about one very dramatic example,
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.940]   perhaps, as we get toward the end.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.520]   It's a very uncommon example,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.440]   but it's called thunderclap headache.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   And trust me, you do not want a thunderclap headache.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.480]   In any case, in this paper,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.700]   they didn't study mechanism directly,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.560]   but they're resting on this known analgesic, anti-pain,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.880]   as well as known anti-inflammatory pathways
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.960]   related to increasing omega-3 intake,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.120]   and simultaneously resting on the idea,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.160]   or I think we now can say conclusion,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.640]   that omega-6 fatty acids, in particular linoleic acid,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.480]   can increase inflammation
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.920]   by way of increasing things like CGRP, vasodilation,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.840]   and some other pathways
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.120]   related to the so-called inflammatory cytokine pathways.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.000]   And there's a whole discussion nowadays
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.600]   of what's called the inflammatome.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.880]   So the basic takeaway is that
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.400]   if you are interested in reducing headache,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.760]   it may be beneficial,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.400]   at least according to these two studies,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.240]   and another one I'll talk about in a moment,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.880]   to increase amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.700]   And that can be done, again,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.640]   through the ingestion of foods.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.960]   Although, based on the dosages
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.120]   that we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   increasing omega-3 fatty acids
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   by taking liquid form fish oil,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.840]   which is perhaps the most cost-effective way
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.480]   to supplement omega-3s,
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.280]   or capsules, which is perhaps the most efficient way
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.840]   to supplement omega-3s,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.240]   will lead to a level of one gram or more of EPA per day.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.880]   Again, that's the EPA form in particular.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.520]   So if you're, for instance, taking supplemental fish oil,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.240]   or you're getting your omega-3s from food,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.740]   and you're getting what you determine to be 2,000 milligrams
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.440]   or two grams per day of omega-3s,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.520]   keep in mind that's going to include EPA and DHA.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.720]   And it does seem that getting above one gram per day
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.880]   of EPA omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.400]   either through food or supplements or both,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.320]   is going to be the critical threshold
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   for reductions in the frequency and intensity of headaches
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.720]   that include both tension headaches and migraine headaches.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.400]   Now, some people will find, actually,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.040]   that ingesting far more omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.980]   generally through supplementation, but again,
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.260]   can be accomplished through foods as well,
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.360]   can also be beneficial for other things such as mood.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.920]   And indeed, there's a whole literature related
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.640]   to effects of ingesting one to three grams,
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.400]   again, three grams per day of EPA.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.240]   So that's going to require quite a high intake of omega-3s
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.120]   in whatever form or supplement you decide
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.800]   to take those into your body.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.160]   But that can improve mood and so forth.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.720]   The basic range that I was able to find in the meta-analysis,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.680]   so meta-analyses are where a researcher will look
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.280]   at the results of a bunch of different studies
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.760]   focused on the same thing,
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.320]   look at the different strength of those studies.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.120]   They'll do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.320]   like remove the most potent study,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.940]   the one that had the greatest effect,
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.620]   and see whether or not there's still an effect
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.760]   of some treatment.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.000]   Or for instance, they will swap in and out different studies
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.920]   and different combinations to see whether or not
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.240]   any one study is really leading to the conclusion
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.920]   that a given treatment does something.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.980]   In any case, in the meta-analyses of omega-3 fatty acids
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.880]   for the treatment of headache,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.560]   and that includes all the different kinds of headache,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.600]   they found in exploring a huge range
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   of omega-3 supplementation ranging from 200 milligrams
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.880]   all the way up to 2,000 milligrams per day,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.540]   it really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.180]   where the significant impact
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.120]   in reducing headache frequency and intensity was found.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.560]   And just very briefly, earlier I mentioned
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.320]   that not only has omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.920]   been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.120]   and intensity of headache in tension type
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.780]   and migraine type headache,
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.000]   but it's also been shown to improve outcomes
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.780]   for premenstrual syndrome related headaches.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.520]   These are what we referred to earlier
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.200]   as hormone-based headaches.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.680]   Again, the low estrogen, low progesterone
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.360]   associated with certain phases of the menstrual cycle
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.280]   as well as other phases of the menstrual cycle
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.800]   are often associated with headache.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.480]   In a study entitled "Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.600]   on Premenstrual Syndrome, a Systematic Review
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.280]   and Again, Meta-Analysis," what they found,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.040]   and here I'm paraphrasing the conclusion,
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.520]   was that omega-3 fatty acids could, yes,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.260]   effectively reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.720]   And one of the symptoms in particular that they found
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.600]   that was reduced was the pain-related symptoms
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.120]   associated with headache.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.040]   And they actually had some very nice hypotheses
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   as to why that likely would be.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.080]   And in fact, point out that in earlier studies,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.600]   omega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.440]   as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.820]   And indeed, there are prescription forms
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.460]   of omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.200]   And I highlight that not because I think people need
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.080]   to run out and get the prescription form
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.280]   of omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.840]   They're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.320]   But because I think oftentimes when we're talking
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.400]   about something like omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   the fact that they are available over the counter
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.120]   in a supplement or by liquid or available in food
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.680]   for that matter, leads many people to conclude that,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.420]   oh, this is supplementation.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.160]   This is something that it's going to have relatively weak
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.080]   or minor impact on things like headache
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.440]   or other health metrics.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.120]   But let's just say that the fact that it exists
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.360]   as a prescription drug in its highest potency form,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.760]   at least in my opinion, points to the potency
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.400]   of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.840]   that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.440]   as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.000]   that are associated with increasing
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.880]   omega-3 fatty acid intake.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.440]   Put simply, omega-3s are not just something
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.600]   that comes from food or supplements.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.920]   They are also being marketed as prescription drugs.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.580]   So I do think they need to be considered as quite potent.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.240]   And at least as far as these papers that again,
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.880]   include meta-analyses of many other papers and data sets,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.600]   indicate that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.880]   to a point where you're getting above one gram per day
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.140]   of EPA is not just going to be beneficial for treating
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.320]   and reducing the frequency and intensity
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.220]   of one particular type of headache,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.060]   but many types of headaches.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.700]   And when you combine hormonal headaches,
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.420]   tension headaches, and migraine headaches,
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.940]   you account for more than 70% of the total types
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.620]   of headaches that are out there.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.700]   The effects of omega-3s on cluster headaches
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.980]   and some of the other types of headaches,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.820]   at least to my knowledge, have not been evaluated.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.700]   There's no reason to think that omega-3s
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.500]   would not be beneficial for those types of headaches.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.980]   But at least as far as the data sets we talked about here
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.640]   are concerned, it is clear.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.520]   Omega-3 fatty acids are going to be a very potent way
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.960]   to reduce pain and to reduce inflammation in ways
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.340]   that can reduce the frequency and the intensity
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.900]   of different kinds of headache.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.340]   (upbeat music)
