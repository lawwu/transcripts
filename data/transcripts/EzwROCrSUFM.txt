[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.280]   All right I need everybody to take a deep breath here because I'm about to
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.000]   stress you out right this is just one little microcosm of the entire tech
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840]   industry but if you look around at all the different categories of software
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.440]   right now the same exact thing is happening and I haven't even mentioned
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.360]   the horde of startups well-funded startups that are getting funded in
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.340]   every single one of these spaces as well and among all of this chaos we have
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.920]   companies that are essentially collapsing in months rather than years you sitting
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.620]   in the middle of all of this right and the question is is how in the world do
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.880]   you find a seam among all of these players to potentially find some traction
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.300]   and win that's the question we have to answer before any of the other stuff like
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.420]   technology infrastructure or even what our roles are in the organization
