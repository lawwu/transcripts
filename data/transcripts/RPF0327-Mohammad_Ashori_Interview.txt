[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.200]   Wouldn't it be great to know about the stuff that you actually need and also to know about
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.900]   the stuff that's a waste of money so you could get the same or better results for cheaper?
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.300]   Mohamed, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.660]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD Thank you, Josh.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.260]   Josh Brennan I'm glad that you reached out to me with
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.860]   this topic. There's going to be two major aspects of our conversation. First, a little
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.300]   bit about your personal financial story, especially as it relates to early retirement. Then we're
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.140]   going to dig heavily into the topic of medicine, of how to save money on medicine. I can just
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.300]   hear the screams of people coming right now. Don't save money on your health. You have
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.580]   to spend money on medicine. This is going to be a fun and provocative topic. First,
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.460]   I'd love to hear a little bit about your personal story, especially as it relates to retirement
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.860]   and personal finance.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.220]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD Sure, sure. I finished residency in 2009,
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.660]   and immediately I started spending as much money as I could just to catch up for those
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:56.620]   initial few years. I did pretty well. I got into debt. I bought a condo. I was, I think,
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.620]   $50,000 in credit card debt, maybe $45,000.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620]   Josh Brennan You did it right. Congratulations.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.740]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD I did it. Yeah, I did it professionally. I had
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.460]   student loans. Pretty much by 2012, I just didn't know how to get out of it. I was so
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.500]   inundated with debt. I was making a ton of money at the time. I was pulling in, I think
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.980]   like $300,000 a year. I just didn't see any way I could ever retire unless I was going
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.700]   to work into my 70s. That's when I just turned it around. I found a website, YNAB, which
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.420]   I know you're pretty fond of. I just got so much great information there. I just started
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.100]   keeping track of everything, brought my expenses down to $7,500 a month, which was awesome,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.580]   which was huge for me. Just kind of slowly chipped away at it. I think I've made pretty
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.580]   good progress now.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.660]   Josh Brennan So tell me that number again. You brought
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.060]   your expenses down to what number?
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.060]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD $7,500 a month.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.980]   Josh Brennan Okay. That was down from, do you have any
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.100]   guess what you were spending before?
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.820]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD Yeah, it was probably about $10,000 to $11,000
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.620]   a month with everything that I was spending on. I was spending money on cars, clothes,
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.060]   traveling, food, that sort of stuff.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.500]   Josh Brennan How old are you now?
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD I'm 37.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620]   Josh Brennan You consider yourself to be financially
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.620]   independent, right?
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.620]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD Yep.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.820]   Josh Brennan Okay. So the timeline for you from graduating,
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.060]   well, I guess we got to figure when you graduated from school versus residency. How many years
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.220]   of an active career did you pursue as a physician until you now consider yourself financially
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220]   independent?
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.260]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD So 2007 is when I started kind of moonlighting,
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.900]   taking a little extra shift on top of my residency. So from 2007 until now, but I would say from
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.180]   2007 until 2012, I was busier accumulating debt than working towards financial independence.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.660]   So from 2012 until now is when I think I really just got serious about it.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.920]   Josh Brennan So about four years and it's primarily based
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.340]   upon reducing your expenses. What did you do? What were the major changes in your lifestyle
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.780]   that you did that allowed you to reduce your expenses?
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.300]   Mohamed Ashoury, MD I think I just second guessed everything.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.460]   I just said, you know, this is how much I'm paying on rent. I don't need to pay this.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.540]   What's the lowest I can pay? I'm paying this much for my cell phone. I don't need to pay
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.300]   this. What's the lowest I can pay? Just everything. My insurance, the fact that I own the car,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.140]   I don't own a car now. Traveling, all the different things, food expenses, all the things
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.100]   that I thought I really, really needed. I just cut them out completely. So in 2012,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.460]   I think it was August 2012, I actually moved out of a penthouse in downtown San Diego and
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.660]   rented a 212 square foot apartment in a really gorgeous part of town, but just completely
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.940]   downshifted. Got rid of everything and said, all right, I'm not going to buy anything.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.940]   I'm not going to add anything back into my life. I'm going to bike everywhere, which
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.740]   isn't easy to do in San Diego. I said, all right, let me just build it up and I'll buy
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.620]   or purchase whatever I desperately, desperately need.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.740]   - That's hardcore, man. Are you still living that kind of super minimalist lifestyle or
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.620]   have you adjusted to a more comfortable standard of living?
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.100]   - I moved from San Diego to Portland about a year ago. When I moved over here, I still
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.780]   got a really tiny studio, 140 square feet. I got rid of my car completely, so I biked
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.380]   everywhere. But I feel like I have a really good lifestyle. There's parks around here.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.420]   I play soccer. I go rock climbing. I have a nice gym membership. The food's amazing
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.860]   here. I go out, drink with my friends, beer. The lifestyle is really good. I don't know
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.760]   how much of a minimalist lifestyle it is, but yeah, I don't have a car. Even though
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.420]   sometimes I will get a rental if I need to, I bought a condo here, cash, for about $140,000.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.180]   It's small. It's 350 square feet, but it's close to everything. It's close to a grocery
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.300]   store. It's close to public transportation. It's within walking distance to my job.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.340]   - In the last four years, from 2012 to 2016, do you have any guess on how much you were
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.980]   making during that time?
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:42.580]   - So 2012, I probably made about $230,000 and then $300,000, $350,000. I got up to $430,000
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.860]   in 2014 and then back down to $300,000 and some. So I'd say on average about a solid
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.380]   three something, $330,000.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.140]   - That's great. You mentioned you're picking up extra shifts and working extra in order
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.780]   to get your income up?
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.220]   - Exactly. That was the time when I had the student loans and the credit cards and probably
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.340]   some other little expenses. I had a car for a while, so I paid that off. That's the time
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.180]   when I really got serious about picking up extra shifts. I said, "Okay, I have good use
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.220]   for this money. I'm probably not going to burn out because I'm not just picking up extra
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.500]   shifts to be a workaholic." I used all that extra money to pay down the debt.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.380]   - It's exciting. It definitely shows the power of a strong income. You certainly invested
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.060]   many years into building that income, but it demonstrates how with focus, living on
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.620]   $7,500 a month is $90,000 a year. You can live a really great lifestyle on $90,000 a
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.060]   year if you minimize a couple of those major structural costs, have reasonable housing,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.820]   reasonable transportation. It leaves you with luxury in every other budget category, but
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.980]   yet still when you have a substantial income, you can make a major difference.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.980]   At this point in time, two more questions and we're going to move to saving money on
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.580]   medicine. First, what are your thoughts? Do you intend to quit working? Are you going
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:08.460]   to adjust anything or are you satisfied and planning to continue the career that you've
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.460]   built?
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:17.060]   - Yeah. I think in a positive way, I'm struggling with that a little bit. I would love to do
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.900]   something for free, just practice medicine for free. I think that's going to be in the
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:28.300]   long-term plan. At the same time, it's kind of a shock for me right now, not recognizing
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.940]   that I don't have to work anymore. It's really exciting. It's awesome. I'm super excited
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:39.460]   about it. At the same time, I think I'll just keep going for this next year and just keep
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.820]   saving the money for now and definitely want to do something more productive. You're probably
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.180]   going to hear me be a little bit critical of the medical industry.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:58.820]   - I'm glad that we're discussing that. It's so new for you. Like you said, you just declared
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.500]   it on March 1st. As we record this interview, it's March 22, 2016. This is just a few weeks
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.980]   old. It's going to take a little time to settle in. I'm excited about the possibilities because
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:14.420]   there are some, I don't know what you're into personally, but there are some awesome aid
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.700]   organizations. There are some awesome organizations that could really use somebody with medical
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.300]   expertise especially if they don't have to pony up a big salary.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.500]   I see some of these doctors who go in and to work with people in remote areas of the
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:37.380]   world. For me, if I were skilled in medical, that's the direction my bent would be. Very
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.940]   cool. Last question on this topic before we transition to medicine. If you were giving
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.180]   advice to yourself, a young medical student, maybe just graduating from school, heading
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:55.820]   into residency, what would be your words of experience from having lived a couple of different
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:06.380]   lifestyles over the last decade? - I would say ignore the prestige of the profession,
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:14.200]   ignore how other people treat you, and definitely ignore the income. Don't just keep working
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.600]   and keep spending because you can easily outspend any kind of income that you can make. Recognize
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.260]   that that income has so much more potential for something really good, like whether you
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.860]   give the money away to a good organization, whether you can become financially independent
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:41.220]   and then give your expertise, give your knowledge away for free. Knowing that you can do that
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:51.300]   in less than 10 years, I would love somebody to just drill that into my skull back then.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.220]   - Sometimes we have to have a little life experience to be ready for advice. After living
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.400]   like a broke college student for years, usually to young residents, the BMW starts to look
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.020]   pretty attractive. Sometimes it takes a few years of driving a BMW, sitting in traffic
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:12.460]   to say, "This is fine, but it would be just as fine in a different form of conveyance."
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.820]   Let's talk about medicine. Specifically, you sent me a note to recommend to suggest this
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.420]   show topic, saying how we could save on healthcare. I'll tell you, I'm totally into saving on
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.980]   healthcare, but I want to start with just the big rebuttal. Anytime I ever say anything
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:38.660]   about saving on health expenses, people immediately accuse me of negligence, negligence toward
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.420]   myself and negligence toward my family. Are we going to play roll the dice on the roulette
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.740]   wheel here and we're gambling with our health just to save a buck, or is there a reasonable
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.940]   path through looking at various medical expenses with a rational mind?
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:02.700]   Absolutely. I think medicine in America is practiced completely in a shotgun approach.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.020]   We're throwing a ton of technology. We're throwing a ton of medications, treatments,
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.380]   labs, and everything at patients. There's so much room for patient autonomy, step in
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.780]   and saying, "Well, yeah, that's great, Dr. Ashoury, but I'm cool. I don't want that."
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:26.340]   It's so sobering. It's incredible when I witnessed that. I think I probably haven't said this,
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:34.020]   but I trained in family medicine, so I did that. Right after I finished residency, I
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.380]   started practicing urgent care because even though I did a lot of family medicine, had
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.900]   my own patients that I was following through in residency, it was just not appealing because
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:50.420]   there was a lot of hand-holding. These patients became dependent on me. I feel like they started
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.460]   neglecting their life a little bit because they would wait until they got the appointment
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.140]   with me. Then they're like, "Okay, Dr. Ashoury, what are you going to do for me? I've gained
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:07.340]   another 15 pounds." That's not good. I started practicing only urgent care. I see my patients
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.620]   coming in, and every once in a while, someone will just completely stop me and say, "Yeah,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.940]   that's great that you want to get a chest x-ray, but what would happen if I didn't get
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:22.700]   the chest x-ray?" You immediately have to change your mentality as a physician because
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.900]   we're trained to protect the patient. We're trained to make sure that we don't miss something
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:34.580]   big. We're trained to self-preservation. I don't want to get sued. I don't want to miss
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.460]   something huge that's going to come and bite me in the butt later. When you get a patient
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.420]   like that, it's very refreshing. That's the patient where you want to focus on, and it's
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.580]   rare. It's very, very rare. I'd say probably the past few shifts that I've had, I can recall
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.580]   two patients.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.460]   Two patients that actually pushed back.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:01.380]   Oh, yeah. I see about 30 to 30-some in a 10-hour shift.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.420]   What percentage of the patients that you see actually need to be there with you?
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.180]   Oh, my goodness. Three to five percent.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:20.740]   Wow. Now, just for the sake of clarity, I would probably have you on if you were on
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.220]   the fringes of the medical profession, but my impression is that you come from a fairly
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:33.260]   mainstream medical background. You're not pushing, I don't know, herbology as medicine.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:39.100]   You're a mainstream physician, mainstream educational background. In one room, you're
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.820]   doing Reiki, and in the next room, you're prescribing antibiotics. You're coming from
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.940]   a mainstream perspective of practical experience.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.420]   It's so funny, right? Because in America, we do have to qualify ourselves. I mean, my
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.380]   name's Mohamed. I was born in Iran, and I lived in Germany for a while. Sometimes people
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.340]   are like, "Oh, you finished medical school in your country? How was that?" No, I finished
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:08.140]   medical school here in the States at UCLA, and then I did UCLA for family medicine residency.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.860]   You kind of have to justify that to a lot of people, especially when you start saying,
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.420]   "Well, actually, you don't need to give your child antibiotics for this ear infection because
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.860]   it will clear." Oh, well, maybe in your country, you guys did that. Sometimes you have to justify
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:30.700]   it, but no, I don't practice herbology out of the back office. I actually don't know
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.940]   much about Western medicine. I do know that it works. I do know when to refer patients
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:43.860]   to maybe, I don't know, acupuncturist, rarely, but sometimes a good chiropractor, that sort
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.900]   of stuff. But no, I definitely have good, strong conviction that Western medicine is
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.060]   great, but we are completely overusing it. We are completely, completely addicted to
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.060]   it.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:03.260]   So, the next category on our outline here is the risks of going to the doctor. Are there
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.780]   risks of going to the doctor?
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:12.660]   There are huge risks of going to the doctor. Yeah, absolutely. I think, where do we start?
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:20.460]   I mean, by just the fact that you know, so Josh, you're coming in to me and you have,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.740]   let's talk about a vague complaint. You have abdominal pain, you have back pain, you have
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:29.780]   a headache. The risk by coming to the doctor with those things is that I am not thinking
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.420]   like, "Oh, well, it's probably just a migraine. You're good to go." I can't diagnose you with
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:42.460]   a migraine or a tension headache or a simple headache based on just examining you, at least
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.940]   not in our current medical system. A lot of these diagnoses that I give you are what we
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:52.100]   call diagnosis of exclusion, which means I ruled out an intracranial bleed. I ruled out
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.100]   a subarachnoid hemorrhage. I ruled out an aneurysm. I ruled out a tumor. I ruled out
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.540]   a vertebral artery dissection. I ruled out, oh, you name it. So, I rule all that out.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.820]   Then I can say, "Guess what, Josh? After the MRI, the CT scan, the blood test, the spinal
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:13.300]   tap, everything's fine. You just have a headache." And you've probably experienced this and I'm
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.460]   sure people who are listening to this have experienced this before.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:27.060]   Definitely. There's a place, I'll tell you, me personally and my family, I'm on the suspicious,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:36.220]   I want good medical help when I need it, but I generally don't want it to be the first
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:42.020]   thing. Now, obviously, I'm in a car accident. My arm's hanging, severed, holding by a strip
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.140]   of flesh. Get me to a surgeon and let's see if we can reattach this thing. But it seems
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:56.900]   normal that our body is designed to heal itself. If you have vague symptoms or a little bit
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:02.100]   of pain, a little bit of discomfort, if there's nothing really striking, maybe just give it
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.340]   a little bit of time and see how it works.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.060]   Because the other thing that I observe as a layperson, not qualified in any way to give
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:15.660]   medical advice, I observe simply that if you have vague symptoms or a vague experience,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.460]   it's not enough information for a physician to even be useful. You need something more
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.820]   specific, something that can actually be slightly categorized so that the physician can rule
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.100]   something out.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.940]   Yeah, it's funny because you're so good with words so you can say this so nicely. I unfortunately
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.660]   can't. But now that you say it that way, it makes a lot of sense. And when somebody does
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:45.180]   come into my office with vague symptoms, it's so difficult because... And I think when you
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.980]   become a more seasoned physician, sometimes you can tease that out. Somebody comes in,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.060]   you say, "Well, what's the reason you came in? What's your biggest fear? What are you
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.820]   worried about? Did somebody tell you something? Did you come across something?" "Well, Doc,
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:04.420]   honestly, my dad died of an aneurysm." Or, "I was online and I saw this article about
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.680]   how... God, I don't know. Something crawls into your brain and lays eggs and I was worried
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.340]   about it." So then I can say, "Okay. All right. I assure you there's nothing that's laying
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.700]   an egg in your brain. That I can rule out. Are you happy with that?" And every once in
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:25.100]   a while they're like, "Oh, yeah. That's great. That's awesome. Thanks, Doc." But I think your
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:33.100]   grandma could... That's the thing. I feel like people have lost that independence, that autonomy
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.620]   of just saying, "Hey, I can own this. This is my body. I have a headache. I have an abdominal
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.900]   pain. What would I do for it? Is it getting worse? Is it getting better? Is it so severe
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.900]   that I can't do anything with it? Let me go to my grandma. Let me go to my aunt. Let me
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.820]   go to that old lady in my apartment complex. She looks, I don't know, motherly. Maybe I
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:03.100]   can ask her and see what she thinks." So I think that's really the first step and not
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.500]   going to the doctor, not dishing out $50 or $100 in the urgent care for it.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:15.020]   I feel like there's a tendency in financial planning as a profession to try to always
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:21.740]   go to the extreme in order to protect yourself as a financial planner. Something simple...
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.840]   I have a buddy of mine who's my age. He's an estate planning attorney. It's just funny
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.420]   to me because he's an estate planning attorney. So for him, a simple will is not enough with
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.660]   simple instructions. You've got to imagine every circumstance and scenario down the road.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.940]   He's not willing just to say, "Just have a will and a sign of guardian and let them figure
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:48.340]   out if you have a simple affairs." I feel like the same tendency can be there in most
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.380]   professions. Is that the case in the world of medical practice that the doctor has to
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.580]   be concerned with what's practical but also has to kind of go and protect against everything?
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.900]   We've got to rule out every possible outcome?
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.980]   Absolutely. I mean, that's always my biggest fear. If I walk into the urgent care, I just
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:13.740]   don't want to miss something big. So I got to really, really, really go far out. Somebody
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.460]   comes in with a very simple complaint and I really got to rule out all the craziness
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.220]   that could be around it. Is it a vasculitis? Is it an autoimmune disease? Is this some
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:30.860]   odd infection that we haven't encountered? Is this histoplasmosis? Is this malaria? In
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.220]   America, we don't see any malaria, so it's so easy to miss malaria in this country. But
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.460]   the most common things are common. If someone comes in with a headache, it's probably a
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.700]   tension headache. It's probably a migraine. It's probably from them clenching their teeth
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:53.980]   and referred jaw pain. But like you said, probably somebody who's really good can make
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.340]   those diagnoses. But with the way the system is, with the way the culture is, the lawsuits,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.820]   the patient complains, all these other things, you have to go to that next step.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:15.700]   What are the influences that affect your mentality as a doctor in today's world?
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:24.660]   I'd say it's what's expected of me, I think. What's expected of me. I feel like I'm expected
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:32.540]   to be infallible. I'm expected to make no mistakes and to not get anything wrong. But
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:40.380]   I'm given a limited set of resources and I'm being given a fallible income. So yeah, I
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:46.500]   mean, if you paid me $10 million an hour and let me run any kind of test and everything
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.380]   possible, sure, maybe I wouldn't make any mistakes. But I think that's what is driving
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:23:04.220]   me, is this very unrealistic expectation to cure and not miss anything while in reality,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.420]   it should be 99% in the patient's hands and it's not.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   So how do you deal with that? I mean, you get pulled in all directions. You've got the
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:21.300]   primary goal, which is to care for the health and safety and well-being and comfort of your
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.780]   patient. That's primary. But you're also faced with the fact this person could turn around
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.300]   and sue you. You've got the threat of litigation if you miss something. You've got the practical
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.980]   realities of your practice, running a business. You've got the professional realities of wanting
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.900]   to be acknowledged as an expert in your field. How do you deal with these various conflicts
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.900]   of interest?
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:50.380]   Well, I think what's important in medicine is you have to practice within the scope of
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.260]   your practice. So I'm an urgent care physician. I'm not a surgeon. So I will do what I was
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:03.980]   taught in Western medicine. But at the same time, I am looking for a way out. Not trying
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.500]   to escape medicine, but I'm also recognizing that the majority of the patients that I'm
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.740]   seeing and the majority of the patients that I'm unfortunately making a lot of money off
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:20.220]   of, I don't need to see. They don't need to be there. By me being there, I'm sort of enabling
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.660]   them. So I am doing the next step. I am saying, "Okay, I've got to become financially independent.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:31.620]   I have to not rely on this income, and I have to do something else with it." Like you. I
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.260]   mean, not saying that you left your profession, but you're taking it to a whole different
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:42.260]   level. You're taking that veil off of it and saying, "This is the reality of personal finance.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.300]   This is the reality of economy. Let me give you all the knowledge and have you make your
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:53.820]   own." Same here. I want to be the consultant. I used to be really big into cars. And one
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:25:00.340]   of my great, great buddies, a mechanic, he's just brilliant. And when you take a car into
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.420]   him, he's just giving you his opinion. He's not emotionally vested in it. He's not trying
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.100]   to lead you in this direction. He's not trying to upsell you. He's just telling you, "This
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.580]   is my professional opinion about your car." And he's usually right, but then he'll just
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:18.340]   walk away. And it's sort of funny. That's what I want to do. Come to me for medical
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:25.020]   advice, but just take your health in your own hands and just own that.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:31.260]   - Yeah. And the parallel I would draw from finance that I'm hearing you say is in the
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.780]   world of finance, when you need insurance advice on life insurance, you need a life
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.060]   insurance agent. You don't need an article on the internet. You need a life insurance
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.940]   agent who's practiced and experienced. When you need portfolio advice because you're trying
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.020]   to figure out how do I structure my portfolio and can I stress test it such that it's going
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.700]   to sustain me for a 30-plus year retirement, I think that's a really good place for a financial
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.500]   advisor. The problem comes when what somebody actually needs is a budgeting system. And
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.900]   then they're sitting in the office of an insurance agent, and the insurance agent is taking time
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.820]   to try to fix their budgeting system and then try to convince them to buy insurance. And
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:15.780]   so the actual diagnosis of the condition, what's the appropriate insurance product,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.420]   what are the appropriate insurance products, that conversation gets minimized because the
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.940]   other things are to the maximum. And I feel like the same thing applies in the world of
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.740]   medicine and what you're sharing is if I come to you and I have a specific clear symptoms
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.620]   and if you're a specialist, you can spend very valuable time diagnosing something that's
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.580]   significant. But if you've got to weed through all this other stuff that should be common
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.100]   knowledge that should be addressed first, then your effectiveness is diminished.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.860]   So let's talk about the most common, I would say, misconceptions, the most common medical
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.940]   misconceptions, the things that you see people all the time that they don't need to be spending
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.820]   money on. What is the first thing that you see people coming all the time and you say,
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.260]   "You should not be spending money sitting here in my office asking me about this"?
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:12.060]   Gosh, I'd say things like back pain and upper respiratory infections, upper respiratory.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:17.100]   So what do we mean by that when we say upper respiratory? So pretty much any kind of sinus,
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:25.720]   ear, nose, eye, throat, lung, chest, throat. I mean, did I say throat already? Ear, whatever.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.620]   Any kind of infection that you catch from other people, any kind of, any of this cough
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:38.580]   and cold stuff, I see... So this is cold and flu season for us right now, right? I probably,
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:46.660]   and I do phone visits too. We do this tele-visit stuff, but I'd probably say 85 to 90% of my
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:54.260]   visits right now are all for colds. Colds, colds that we would never... I can't do anything
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.940]   for. I can't treat a cold. I can recommend over-the-counter medicine. I can prescribe
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.780]   you a stronger cough medicine, but I'm seeing like 30-some patients just for colds in one
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.100]   day. Can you imagine?
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.060]   So what do they expect you to do? Why do they come in to see you?
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:19.380]   I don't know. It's... I don't... Maybe... So this is the weird thing. I think I was raised
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:26.940]   in a different culture. I wasn't raised, but I was about 10 when I lived in Iran. And so
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.620]   in that culture, you don't take your kids in for colds. So maybe there is a bit of disconnect
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:37.780]   there. But I think maybe in the Western culture, you go in for a cold because you just want
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.620]   it to be better faster. And that's really what I get from the patient. Like, "Hey doc,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.820]   I'm kind of tired of it. It's been seven days. It's been 10 days. I really, I can't, you
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.780]   know, I need to stop coughing. I have meetings. I have phone appointments. My clients are
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.700]   getting annoyed that I'm coughing. They're worried that I'm passing something on to them."
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.900]   You know, or sometimes they're, you know, they're just miserable. They're like, "Doc,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.100]   I can't sleep at night." You know, or "My ear hurts so much. It's really becoming frustrating.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.100]   I don't want to take all these over-the-counter meds. Can you just give me some antibiotics
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:16.020]   so I can get better?" And that's really where the crux of it is. I want antibiotics.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.500]   Do you think it's primarily like almost a placebo that I'm going to feel better because
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.100]   I've been prescribed a pill and this magic pill is going to make me better?
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:30.500]   Well, the pill is not coincidentally magic. I mean, antibiotics like azithromycin, erythromycin,
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:36.580]   doxycycline, these were intentionally designed to decrease inflammation. They're fed to farm
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:42.820]   animals to decrease inflammation. They just make you feel better when you take them. Even
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:48.420]   if you're not having an infection, even though, you know, people know all the side effects,
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.300]   they want them because they've taken them before and they are getting better. And they've
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:59.380]   probably grown up taking antibiotics when they've gotten sick. So it's intentional.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:07.340]   I'm very convinced that medications these days are engineered, built, designed to, you
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:13.060]   know, make you feel good in some sort of way so that you do want them.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.980]   I guess I'm just testing my own perspective to see it, just to find out if I'm wrong
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.420]   or right because I don't want to be foolish or foolhardy. It's especially as a parent,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.580]   you know, I feel the weight of my children being sick much more heavily even than myself
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.740]   because of that sense of responsibility. So I don't want to be foolhardy. But I was
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:37.980]   raised, my mom was a farm girl and I guess just kind of a more practical approach that
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.420]   if you're sick, you get in bed for a couple of days and generally, I eschew the use of
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.700]   medicine unless it's very much needed because I figure every medicine has potential benefits
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.500]   and it also has potential side effects. I mean, if I get diarrhea when I'm traveling,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.220]   I don't want to use Imodium unless I'm going to fly and I'm going to be on a plane
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.040]   because I don't want my system disrupted. I figure my body is trying to get rid of something
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.060]   and it's trying to fix itself. So I should just give it some time and let it work, stay
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.220]   hydrated and give it some time to let it work because I don't want to be dealing
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:15.940]   with the side effects of everything. So I'm looking to see if what I hear you saying
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.660]   is that that practical perspective is valuable. What other things do you see people for all
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   the time that you would say are just common misconceptions?
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:31.580]   Yeah. So I think in Western medicine specifically, people feel the need to take vitamins. They
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:36.580]   think supplements and vitamins are helping their cause and it's not. Vitamins have a
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:41.860]   ton of side effects. Vitamin C and calcium can increase your risk of kidney stones, can
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.020]   increase your risk of heart disease later on in life. So vitamins, I don't know. I
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.460]   hope you're not taking them, but I just don't recommend them.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:56.220]   Do you say that as a blanket statement, meaning just no vitamins or a multivitamin a day might
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.140]   be useful? How hardcore are you?
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:05.940]   I'm pretty hardcore. I mean, even in Europe, it's pretty common knowledge for physicians
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.300]   to say that vitamins are not good for you and they actually are detrimental to your
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:16.660]   health. And when you research it, they really are. They don't offer any benefit and some
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:21.580]   independent studies have shown that they increase your independent mortality. So they're not
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.740]   good for you.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.860]   That's one I haven't researched, but it's an interesting topic to me. What next?
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:36.180]   Oh, this one's a good one. Cholesterol screening and blood sugar screening. So people think
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.060]   that they have to go to the doctor to regularly get their blood tests done, get their cholesterol
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.700]   done, get their blood sugar done, get their blood pressure checked. We definitely overdo
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:52.620]   it. I think there's a need for that in somebody who is at high risk or has a very unhealthy
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.740]   lifestyle. Sure, you can get a good sense of where you're at, but blood tests are not
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:03.380]   that accurate. And I think that's what a lot of people miss. You can get somebody who is
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.140]   six foot tall and 350 pounds coming in, but their blood tests, everything might be perfect.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.500]   Their blood pressure might be perfect. Does that mean everything's okay? No, it doesn't.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.980]   It does not at all. So that's another big misconception.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.660]   That's been personally my medical history. I've always been overweight, but I've always
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:27.140]   had perfect, anytime there's lab tests or blood tests, all the ranges for cholesterol
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:35.380]   and blood sugars and things like that come back as within the normal ranges. And it can
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:41.580]   be probably misread. On the one hand, it allows me a sense of security of, "Oh, yeah, I'm
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.500]   overweight, but at least I have perfect blood numbers. Therefore, everything's fine." I
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.420]   don't know if that's good or bad, but that's my personal experience.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.700]   I think it's understandable. People just want to have some sort of a sense of where they're
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:00.020]   at. And if they see a bad cholesterol number, then at least they would kick it up into the
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.740]   next ... They would say, "Okay, that's it. I got to really get my stuff together." But
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.940]   I feel like we lull patients into a false sense of security by telling them, "This blood
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.100]   test shows everything's fine, so you're good. But who designed the blood test? What does
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.780]   this blood test really measure? Is it really looking at the lining of the vessels?" And
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.900]   it's not. It's like in a good economy, if you got a crappy bunch of tech stocks in a
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:30.580]   good economy, you're always going to be fine. But when it's really tested is when the economy
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.580]   crashes and everything else crashes with it. Same here. If your body really gets sick one
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:41.340]   day, if you contract, God forbid, some sort of a crazy illness, a cancer, something, and
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.000]   your health is not that good, I don't care what those numbers read, you're not going
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.780]   to recover that well from that illness. But if you're healthy overall and you do get really
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.740]   sick, you're probably going to be okay. I'll touch on that in a little bit, but people
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:01.780]   can get cancers and heart attacks and strokes and be just fine if they're healthy. So that's
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.260]   another big one.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.980]   Mammograms and PSA tests.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:10.200]   Right. So we overdo mammograms. There's been plenty of studies for that. Not only do we
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.000]   overdo mammograms, which means by the way, a mammogram is a low dose x-ray that we apply
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.480]   to breast tissue and men can get mammograms as well. And we look for cancers. We look
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.540]   for real subtle abnormalities. And the problem is we're radiating so many young women's breasts.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:34.420]   We're radiating people who possibly are a bit at risk for cancers. And by radiating
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.820]   them, we're increasing the risk of cancers. And then when we do find something, we over
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:45.220]   biopsy them. We over-treat them. Benign cancers that probably would be fine, we're going crazy
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.220]   with it.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:51.640]   PSA tests. So we do a prostate specific antigen, which is a blood test that checks whether
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:56.380]   you might have prostate cancer. A lot of people want them. They come in, they ask for them.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.340]   Unfortunately, a lot of times these are abnormal for other reasons. For example, your prostate's
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:08.500]   a bit inflamed from an infection or from just being larger due to age. And then PSA is abnormal.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.860]   Great. Let's do a biopsy. Biopsy didn't show it. Let's go in with a camera. So it's just
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.940]   a big spiral.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.940]   Ear infections.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.700]   Ear infections in children. There's a lot of great studies and a lot of good pediatricians
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:27.540]   will not treat ear infections in children anymore unless, for very specific reasons,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:32.420]   if the child's very young or if they're recurrent and the child has decreased hearing. But other
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:38.060]   than that, ear infections, probably viral, even if bacterial, will go away on their own.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:45.540]   So our thought, we want to be very careful with a very young baby. We try to be extra
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.300]   cautious with a very young baby as far as anything like that. But with a similar advice
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.240]   to a cold, apply. Just give it a little bit of time. Watch the child for a little bit
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.620]   of discomfort, a little bit of sickness that's not necessarily cause for alarm. Give it some
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.260]   time and watch for acute symptoms. Watch for something that's really worrying. Is that
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.580]   a reasonable approach?
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:13.540]   Yeah. So I like this question because this is a great money saver and stress saver for
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.580]   parents. So you have a little one, I don't care, three months, a year, two years, and
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.860]   he or she comes down with a cold, coughing, congested, can't breathe out of the nose,
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.660]   has a croupy cough, has a barking cough, a little bit of wheezing, fevers. But the
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:34.980]   child's eating, the child's pooping, the child's peeing. There's no weird coloration. Sure,
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.520]   the kid might have a little bit of a hard time getting through the night. If you really
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.640]   want to, you can do a bit of Tylenol or ibuprofen for the fevers or the pains. But if the child
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.100]   is doing well, they're able to hydrate. And that's really the biggest key with children
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.900]   is if they can hydrate, if they're having wet diapers, you're probably okay. If they
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:58.100]   can keep something down, even if they're retching and vomiting, nausea, you know, they don't
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.940]   want to eat, their throat's really sore. If they can get through this very, very well,
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.020]   as long as they're staying hydrated, as long as they can take in some calories. It doesn't
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.300]   have to be solids. It can be Gatorade, it can be Pedialyte, as long as they can keep
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.220]   those things down. Yes, watch it, wait it out, because you bring them to the doctor's
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.700]   office and those lungs sound terrible, I got to get a chest X-ray. If that ear looks horrible,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.300]   probably going to have to recommend antibiotics.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:30.740]   So, on the next four bullet points on our outline here of our preparation for today's
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.900]   show, these are pretty wacky. And so I'm going to give you a chance to talk about this and
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.780]   then I'm going to push back on how these things actually save money. But I'm going to read
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:43.840]   because I think this is a funny setup. So, under the heading of common medical misconceptions,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:49.900]   you have indicated, number one, you need a doctor to control your pain, alcohol is bad
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.980]   for you, coffee is bad for you, cigarettes kill, and you'll die if you don't eat. So,
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.100]   you got a little bit of a case to make because these are unusual. How do you mean that these
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   are misconceptions?
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.820]   So, misconceptions is, you know, if you even look at a cigarette, you're going to die.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.780]   No, not true. Plenty of good studies out there show that if you're smoking one or two cigarettes
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.020]   a day, your risk of cancer, your risk of heart disease is minimal. I'm not saying smoke,
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:23.140]   I don't smoke. I'm not telling anybody that you should go pick it up. But, you know, let's
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:29.300]   face it, we have this big campaign against tobacco, but it's also a big financial campaign.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:36.180]   Tobacco is not as bad as it's made, it's this huge villain. It's insane. It's insane and
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.180]   it's not true.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.260]   You know, I've only ever met one person who actually does that. I'm sure more people do,
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:46.420]   but I had one friend who was a financial planner and she had one cigarette every single night.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.500]   And so, every night after dinner, she would go out on her balcony and she would smoke
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:56.740]   one cigarette. And I never knew anybody else who could keep that point of non-addiction,
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.860]   non-over usage other than her. But, there would be a perfect case study of what you're
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   talking about.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.900]   Right. And I think one other thing to consider is when you're driving in traffic and you're,
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.100]   you know, butt to butt to another car, you know, the amount of chemicals you're getting
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:17.540]   in your system is way, way, way more than a pack of cigarettes that you could get because
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.140]   you're getting it every single day. You're also sedentary. You're sitting down, you're
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.220]   stressed. When you're sitting down and when you're stressed and your body is getting these
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.700]   nauseous chemicals in the system, there's a big difference. And when you're all relaxed,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:36.060]   chilling, listening to some Joshua Sheets podcast and smoking a cigarette, it's very
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.060]   different.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.180]   You know, I have a theory on cigarettes and you could, I've never talked about this publicly.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:47.020]   This is just one of my little pet theories. But I think that sometimes smokers who occasionally,
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.180]   I don't know what the number is on this because obviously there's pretty damning evidence
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.820]   on the level of carcinogens at a point and I don't think you're disagreeing with that.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.500]   But sometimes I wonder if smokers' happiness isn't simply due to the fact that they take
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:05.420]   breaks and they breathe. And those two things combined can make a big difference on your
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:11.060]   stress levels. Now, I have zero medical qualifications to opine on this subject. So take it for what
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.060]   it's worth.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:18.780]   But when I read studies and just talking about the impact of stress and how the chemicals,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.700]   whether it's the levels of acidity or just the chemicals that your body creates when
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:28.460]   responding to acute stress, I see how just simply the virtue of slowing down, taking
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:34.060]   a break and kind of what smokers will do out on the smoker's corner is sit down and breathe
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:39.180]   and talk. Now, of course, you could do that without the smoke going into your lungs. But
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:45.020]   my theory is that sometimes smokers have a more positive lifestyle simply because of
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.420]   taking the time to have a break and to breathe.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:54.740]   Yes. And Josh, honestly, if I could prescribe one cigarette a day to somebody versus Xanax
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:00.220]   or Ativan or Prozac, I would do so. But I still need my medical license for a little
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.060]   bit. So I'll hold off on that.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.820]   So keep going on these other.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.500]   So another one, you need a doctor to control your pain. Pain is such a big one in America
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.100]   too, right? Because people are busy. They got stressful lives and they just can't be
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.920]   bogged down with pain and pain takes over the world. But I think people are more afraid
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.100]   of pain because they think it indicates something really bad. And that's never, never the case.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.980]   No. Well, I should say that's almost never the case. When your body hurts, it's OK. The
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.380]   pain is probably going to go away or there's something you're doing wrong. And you don't
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.700]   need a doctor for that. If you have a bad knee, some exercises, some maybe some weight
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.060]   loss, some strengthening, the pain is probably going to go away. You don't need a surgeon
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.580]   to go in there and say, oh, you have a meniscus tear. We're going to clean this up. So in
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:53.220]   my case, I have a small tear in my medial meniscus and I got a labral tear in my right
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.180]   shoulder and I still do everything that I'm pretty active. I'm fit and everything. You
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.340]   don't need a doctor for that. You just don't. And it hurts. Yes, it hurts every once in
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.300]   a while. It's not a big deal. Once you get used to that kind of pain, once you accept
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.500]   it and say, hey, this is my body, it's going to be all right. It's not depressing. I don't
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.220]   have a bad lifestyle. It's just something I noticed. So I think just putting it into
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:19.180]   perspective, it's really, really important. It's OK to live with pain. It's not a big
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:23.140]   deal. Our pets do it all the time and they're the happiest things on the planet.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:31.820]   Here's my way of thinking about it. Feel free to correct it. But my thought, I like the
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:36.980]   more natural approach. And with regard to pain, this makes sense to me. Pain is my body's
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.560]   way of saying, I have a problem. I need a little bit of time to rest and recuperate.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.660]   So treat me gently. So if there's some mild knee pain or mild shoulder pain, I need to
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.580]   be careful and not put excess weight. It's the body's way of protecting that so that
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:55.020]   it can mend and heal itself. It's not something to immediately freak out about. It's something
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:00.980]   to observe and to notice and to perhaps give a little bit of extra rest to that body part.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.380]   It's not something that I should cover up. It's not something that I should try to numb
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.540]   with medicine. Just it's something that I should pay attention to.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:14.300]   Now, again, my caveat, of course, there may be an acute pain and that's a symptom of something
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.900]   significantly wrong. But is that a reasonable way of thinking about it?
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:24.660]   Absolutely. I agree 100%. And I know some of your listeners might have some serious
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.060]   chronic pain issues. And so, of course, they're crucifying me and hopefully they're not crucifying
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:34.180]   you. But there are certain conditions. There are certain things that are so bad. There
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.220]   are certain types of pains that are so tough to deal with. And again, I'm not saying you
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:44.280]   don't need a doctor at all. But we're talking about the most common pains that we have.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.260]   And they are exactly that. They're signals. Something, your body's saying, "Something's
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:55.100]   off. Can you please just give me a break?" And you do that and it works. So, I agree.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.660]   You'll die if you don't eat.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.900]   All right. This is a good one. So, you'll die if you don't eat. Patients come in, they
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.220]   say, "Doc, I've been having nausea. I've been having vomiting, diarrhea for the past seven
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.860]   days. I haven't eaten anything for three days." Okay. That's fine. You're not going to die.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.520]   You don't need to eat. You won't die if you don't eat. You're not going to become more
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.440]   unhealthy if you don't eat. You can drink water. You can drink your calories. You can
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:26.920]   do Gatorade. You can do Pedialyte. But people fast. People fast for days on end. People
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.940]   actually – there are some studies that show that individuals who fast a few hours a day
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:38.080]   or fast for a few days in a row have certain better health conditions. I'm not a fan of
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.640]   that. I never think it's good to do some sort of an extreme to your body. But there's nothing
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.960]   wrong with not eating. And if that's part of your sudden weight loss plan, that's fine
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.000]   too as long as you realize that you're probably going to crash pretty good afterwards.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Coffee and alcohol?
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.920]   Right. So, I drink coffee regularly and I think I heard you take a sip of yours. So,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.680]   coffee is not bad for you. There's great studies that show that it can decrease your risk of
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   colon cancer, certain other types of cancers. It stains your teeth, sure. It can give you
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:14.920]   more acid, but probably most of your acid is coming from stress. Alcohol, right. If
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.080]   you have an addiction, it's very different. I don't know if you drink or have drank, but
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.680]   if me or another one of my friends drinks alcohol, we're not going to get addicted to
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.260]   it. We just don't have the genes. We don't have the predisposition. But a little bit
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.680]   of alcohol does not cause cancer. A little bit of alcohol does not destroy your liver.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:39.400]   So, I think also recognizing that, that these little insults to your body mean nothing in
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:45.000]   the big scheme of things. You can deal with quite a lot and come out just fine, but it
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.240]   matters whether you're stressed, whether your body is just depleted of energy because then
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.880]   it can't cope with it. And here's a good one. Last one. I know I keep talking a lot about
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.480]   this scientific stuff, but there's been a lot of great studies that show people have
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.880]   a higher risk of melanoma if they've been drinking a lot of alcohol and been under the
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.600]   sun for extended periods of time. So, that combination together has a much higher effect
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.160]   of you having melanoma than just having either sun exposure or alcohol.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:22.960]   Interesting. So, you make that statement and obviously I understand, but I don't understand
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.040]   the meaning of that. Is the idea don't drink when you go in the sun or is the idea that
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.320]   stressed out people are the ones who are just slamming them down while they're sitting in
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.200]   the sun and that's ultimately what's leading to the melanoma?
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.720]   So, in between that, it means that if your body's under stress because you're overworked,
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.840]   you're not sleeping enough, you're fighting with your spouse, and your body is so depleted
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:50.960]   of energy that it cannot even maintain the simple act of treating little tiny cancers,
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.680]   treating little bit of DNA damage that happens every single second in your body. If you're
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.160]   in that condition, you put a little bit of alcohol in your system, then sure, it can
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:06.080]   damage your body. If you go drive behind a big semi truck and you inhale all those carcinogens,
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.000]   sure, then you have a higher risk of cancer. But if your body is really not under that
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.920]   much stress and your body can do a lot of self-regulation and self-healing, you could
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.400]   probably work in some pretty dirty industries with a ton of carcinogens and you would be
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.560]   just fine. And I think that's a really, really important thing to take into consideration.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.760]   I read a book one time, you mentioned the acidity of stress, and I guess I read a book
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:41.080]   one time talking about the acid-alkaline balance of your body. And the major premise of the
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.340]   book was, I believe it was called The pH Miracle, if memory is right, but the major premise
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:53.320]   of the book was that it's the acidity of your body that causes your body to become sick
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.640]   and that if you focus on acidity, you can generate better health. And so the primary
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:05.320]   cause of acidity was self-created hormones and chemicals in the body, primarily due to
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:11.120]   stress. That was one of the author's conjectures. And then also many other factors, coffee being
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:17.240]   acidic, meat being acidic, sugar being acidic, etc. I haven't seen that theory. I read that
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:23.320]   book on it and it seemed to make sense to me as a layperson, but I haven't seen that
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.800]   theory spread more widely. I haven't seen that receive a lot of popular attention. Do
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.320]   you know anything about that? Is that accurate? Is that known in the medical circles? Has
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.000]   that been corroborated or disproven in some way?
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.200]   It's just that the way we do scientific research, I don't think it's been ever proven. That's
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.280]   just not the way things are tested in medicine. Things are tested on animals based on whatever
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.520]   outcome you get. If the animal didn't have a horrible outcome, you test it on humans
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:57.280]   and then you just go for it. But if you look at other cultures, so some cultures believe
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:04.180]   in hot and cold versus acidic and basic. So it's just one of those things that's been
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:09.600]   around a lot of cultures for a long time. And yes, if you talk to people who are a little
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:15.560]   bit more holistic based, they absolutely believe in that. And my patients, even the patients
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:21.400]   that I have who lead their life that way, I feel like they're much healthier by just
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.380]   controlling their acid base. And they can call it whatever they want. This food creates
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.440]   more heat. This food creates more cold. This food creates more acidity. This one more basicity.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:36.760]   So I know where I've experienced those is with stress. So I have observed if I get a
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.960]   there are a few emotions that when they get to me, I feel them physically. And the big
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.560]   three are when I get a sense of overwhelm. And this happens to me from time to time.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.000]   I generally put so many things on my to do list and I start to get overwhelmed. That
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.960]   leads to just this tension. And I've noticed it. I don't want to be too dramatic, but it
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.600]   almost just forces my brain to shut down. And I've learned that I have to proactively
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:05.180]   manage that. I'm not great at it. I'm getting better at it. But just proactively managing
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.680]   that sense of overwhelm. I have to shut everything off and I have to focus on just some simple
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:15.280]   quiet reading. I have to build time into my schedule where I ignore the world because
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:21.600]   it seems like I have so many things running at me. I got inboxes filling up in eight different
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.640]   applications. I've got all these things coming in. Everyone's upset at me. Everyone's blah,
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.200]   blah, blah. And so I tend to get overwhelmed. Another one is that I feel the physical effect
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:38.280]   of that emotion. And so I know there's a physiological connection. Another one is fear, which I don't
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.760]   experience a lot of that, but I know that sense of unease if I start to get it, I feel
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:51.080]   it. And then the big one for me is criticism. I feel that in my stomach. One of my major
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.720]   character weaknesses is I'm a people pleaser and I like to please people. And so when someone
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.240]   is displeased, it causes me, I feel it in my stomach, Mohammed. I actually get viscerally
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.440]   sick when that, and I have to just turn it off. I usually have to ignore it for a little
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:10.480]   while, let some time pass and then relate. But I am convinced that those emotions and
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.280]   just call them stresses, those stresses have a physiological effect on me that I can feel.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.020]   Not that I know I'm going to get sick in 10 years, but I can feel them now in the pit
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:23.720]   of my stomach. And so I'm convinced that a lifestyle of that type of stress built up
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.960]   over time has a physiological effect.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:35.120]   It has a physiologic effect and a long-term damaging effect because people put themselves
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.360]   under these stressful situations for so long and they don't have good coping mechanism,
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:45.400]   good coping skills. You do. I mean, just listening, I feel like listening to your podcast, you
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:52.000]   seem to do such a good job of taking criticism and brushing it off. Or it might just be show,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.280]   but I doubt it. Usually people succeed when they have good coping mechanisms. And I think
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:03.120]   if you can develop that, if a person can develop good coping mechanisms, then you can do fine.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:08.200]   And even though you do get a bit of damage in your body, you can recover as well. And
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.600]   I think that's important too.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.920]   Yeah. It's not, no, I don't brush it off. I've just learned how to, because I know it's
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.840]   going to affect me. I've learned how to put some distance between it and then I've grown
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.280]   in that a lot. It's a new skill that I've learned over the last few years. And so I've
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.200]   learned, listen, I'm not going to allow this to affect me. And usually for me, it's just
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.400]   time. Just give it a few hours and then you quiet your emotions, you quiet your heart.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.280]   For me, I pray, I quiet my emotions, I quiet my heart, and then I can go back and I can
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   start again. But with a quiet spirit, then I can go ahead and face things and I can look
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.680]   to pull the good out of it and disregard those things that are not helpful.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:52.280]   So talk about, we've talked about some of these things as basically ways of saving money.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.720]   And so the general consensus that I pull from what you've shared so far is slow down just
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.840]   a little bit, be a little bit more, have a little more what used to be common sense.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.080]   Don't rush to the doctor for everything and just slow down a little bit and let your body
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:14.720]   simply work. And that is a kind of a defensive approach to cause you to not always be forcing,
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.560]   putting money out the door. But what are some of the things that we can do proactively here
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.760]   under lifestyle and genetics? What are the things we can do proactively to invest in
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.200]   our health so that we don't wind up even, so we have fewer symptoms, so we get sick
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   less?
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.600]   So, you know, your body doesn't come with a manual. So a little bit of it is you just
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:39.640]   having to develop that sense of being in tune with your body. And I think a lot of people
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.760]   are not doing that. It's recognizing, like we've already talked about, when my body's
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.280]   under stress, what is it that I got to do to de-stress it? Is it I got to take some
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.880]   things off my plate? Maybe I got to cross some things off my to-do list. Is it better
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.160]   for me to spend these next three hours to tell my loved ones, "Hey guys, I'm sorry.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   I got to step away for a little bit. I just got to clean all these things off of my stress
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.560]   list." And once you do that, you just feel great. And that alone might create a better
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:15.160]   sleep the next night. It might decrease your need to eat or binge on unhealthy food. So
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:22.520]   I think that lifestyle, that sense about your body is really important to develop. And yeah,
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.960]   there is no good way of telling you how to do it, but if you just try, you'll get it
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:33.960]   right. You'll eventually figure it out. So definitely, stress, right? Decreasing stress,
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.600]   decreasing your sleep. A lot of us, I think you're in your 20s or I don't know, you're
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.600]   young.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   30.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:45.920]   Okay, 30. So we probably still need eight to 10 hours of sleep. And some of us say,
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.440]   "No, no, no, no, no. I do great on five." Yes, you do. Absolutely. Many people function
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:56.120]   much better. They're more alert because their body is so much more stressed that they actually
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:01.260]   do better with tasks and getting things done when they only sleep four to five hours. But
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:06.760]   that doesn't mean that that's what you need. And of course, diet. Diet's a big one. And
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   I'm sure we'll get into that in a bit if we still have time. So weight loss, right? So
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.600]   weight's a big one, controlling your weight and controlling how much activity you have.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.720]   And somewhere in the bottom of this document that me and you are looking at, I've mentioned
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.600]   you can weigh a lot more if you're very active. You can weigh a lot more if you're eating
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   healthy food. So weight is becoming less and less of an issue in medicine and science.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:39.080]   We're finding out that it's not as important what you weigh. It's more important probably
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:44.000]   what you're putting in your body and how active you are. And again, in this culture, it's
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.680]   all about running and marathons and crazy stuff. You don't need to do that. You can
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:56.200]   walk. You can bicycle. You can just getting up from your desk and going somewhere and
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.760]   going for a quick walk while you're doing a phone conversation, while you're reading
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.880]   something, even like walking on those stationary treadmills. That is great activity. It doesn't
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.600]   need to be this elaborate gym membership with this exercise, a bit of cardio, a little bit
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   of this, a little bit of that. It doesn't need to be that.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:19.960]   I'm convinced some of that stuff is really damaging. I was about to say I keep that opinion
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   quiet and here I am broadcasting it on a podcast. But it's a little hard from a non-athlete
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:32.680]   perspective to be taken seriously when you're criticizing other people who are very active.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:38.600]   I have a friend of mine who was just a committed triathlete, Ironman. He was just so committed
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:44.840]   to it. I love and admired his character and his dedication and his discipline. But when
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.240]   I look at the effect on his body, his body just seemed to be breaking down. He had all
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:55.200]   these damages from overuse, knee issues and whatnot, which significantly impacted his
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:02.760]   life. It seems to me that just a more reasonable perspective is a healthier approach, not being
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:08.480]   so extreme. Now, that type of person, it seems to be connected to their character where they
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:12.600]   just have an extreme personality and that's where they find their outlet. Again, I have
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.080]   no place to criticize someone who goes out and does that. But it doesn't seem to me to
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.920]   be the most healthy thing.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:25.000]   I'd say as objective as possible as a physician, I see both sides. I see the person who's just
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.320]   destroying their body with way too much exercise, lowering their immune system to the point
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:34.560]   of catching pneumonias and meningitis. I see the other person who's so busy and involved
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:41.240]   in building a business, running their business, dealing with situations that they're so sedentary
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:46.360]   that they themselves are destroying their life. Somewhere in the middle, and it doesn't
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:50.960]   have to be perfect. That's the thing. Our bodies are amazing without it. You don't have
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.800]   to be perfect. You just got to do a little bit more. You just got to decrease the time
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.360]   you spend around the kitchen table a little bit, or at least take the food away, bring
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:06.720]   in some tea, bring in some vegetables, bring in some fruits, and then go for a walk together.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:13.240]   Just increasing your activity every single day in little steps makes a humongous difference.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.560]   I think that's such an easy thing to implement.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:24.840]   Talk to me about some strategies of actually navigating the medical system. Pretend I actually
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.640]   have some problems, I have some issues, and I need the input of a physician. Now, what
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.920]   are some proactive strategies that I can implement to control the financial cost of that while
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:39.400]   getting the medical help that I need while controlling the financial outlay?
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:48.320]   A few things. A lot of insurances now, I'm a big advocate for HMOs. I don't like PPOs,
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.920]   and I know there's a lot of different types of insurances out there, but HMOs are nice
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.280]   because everything's under one roof. For the most part, you do save money. People are worried
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.480]   that they're not going to get a good physician, but I think you can always spot a good physician,
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   and you can certainly change physicians to find that.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.520]   Back to your point, I think when you get a symptom, when you get something, look it up.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.340]   Don't be afraid to go online. Look things up, but recognize that there's a lot of sensationalism
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:19.600]   out there on the internet. If you have a headache and you're worried about something, take a
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.000]   look. If you have a rash, go online, look at some rashes. Describe the rash, and look
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.800]   at pictures on Google. When you see that, you kind of get a good sense.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:35.440]   Almost all good health insurances now, you can email your doctor for free. You can do
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.360]   video visits or telephone visits for free. I do telephone visits once a week or so. I
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.120]   talk to about 50 patients in 10 hours, and it's all free. Our medical group does not
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.560]   charge for it, and I love it. Patients love it. I can chat with them online. I can see
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.960]   their face. They can send me pictures of their rash, of their kid's rash. They send me pictures
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:02.120]   of their poop and their vomit. Fine. No big deal. I'm happy to look at it. It's great
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   because I can say, "No, look. That's all that is. Don't worry. It's probably just this.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.240]   It's probably just that." That's a really good way of cutting your cost. Just running
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:16.600]   it by someone. See if that doctor's eyes bulge out. If they bulge out, you're probably dealing
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:22.400]   with something a little bit more problematic. If not, then don't worry about it.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.960]   I think this is a good one. Find a doctor friend. Find even a good nurse friend. This
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.780]   social capitalism thing that ... Social capital, not capitalism. Social capital thing that
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:39.840]   you talk about is huge. Find a friend that's a doctor or become friends with a doctor and
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.080]   run something by them. No, I'm not going to give you a diagnosis on the fly. Of course
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.080]   not. I don't want to get sued by you later, but I'll gladly tell you that, "Nope. That
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.240]   doesn't look concerning. I just weighed it out." That's another big one.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.200]   Imaging, surgeries. Those are my two big, big, big pet peeves. We do so many MRIs and
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   CTs and x-rays. Yes, we're picking up a ton more diagnoses. The fact that we have more
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.880]   cancers now is probably just because we're diagnosing them more. We do them, but they're
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:15.000]   not necessary. This ties into breast cancer and prostate cancer in older patients. They
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.720]   can be left completely untreated and that patient will probably not have any issues
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.560]   with it. They will die gracefully at an old age before they die from those cancers. That's
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.120]   how a lot of really good surgeons are managing cancers these days. They're saying, "Sir,
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.400]   you're 75 years old and you're in great health. That prostate won't even bother you. Yep,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.680]   you got cancer in it. Don't worry about it. Leave it alone."
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:45.000]   The last one is specialists. If you go to a specialist, if you go to a cardiologist,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.360]   if you go to an orthopedic surgeon, and I don't want to get killed by one of your subscribers
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.040]   here, who is a specialist? There's nothing wrong with going to a specialist. When you
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:02.280]   have the option to go straight to a specialist, my orthopedic surgery friends, they're trained
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.080]   to fix you surgically. They're less inclined to tell you, "Well, this is what I would do.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.840]   I would go lose 30 pounds and I would do these exercises and you should be fine." No, they're
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.720]   like, "Dude, I can take you in the OR tonight at 6 p.m. and I can shave that stuff off of
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:22.040]   your meniscus and you'll be great. You're going to walk perfectly." When you get that
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.440]   surgery, unfortunately, later on in life, you're going to get arthritis. There is no
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.360]   knee surgery that I've ever heard of that you can get done. No intervention into your
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.640]   knee that's not going to cause you arthritis down the road. Is it worth it? I don't think
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.200]   so. Same with cardiologists who may say that, "Yeah, you probably need a treadmill stress
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.440]   test because we got to make sure this is not coming from your heart." Oh, it is a little
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.920]   bit abnormal. Let's go into your groin and go into your heart and see what's going on.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.200]   Oh, sorry, when we did that, we also knocked off this little plaque that went into your
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.120]   brain and you got a stroke, but your heart was good. Sorry about that.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:03.040]   And Mohamed, what you're focusing on here is my biggest, I was going to say beef, but
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.000]   my biggest, I guess, frustration is it seems to me that if I go to a, like I said, if I
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.840]   go to a surgeon, there's a higher likelihood that the surgeon is going to diagnose surgery
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:21.600]   to improve my ailment. If I go to a physician who is primarily dispensing medicine, there's
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:27.280]   probably going to be a prescription that I go out with as the initial stage of treating
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:34.200]   my ailment. If I go to a holistic natural health doctor, there's probably going to be
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.600]   some system of vitamins and natural foods and whatnot that are going to be my primary
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:47.400]   basis of treating it. It leaves me as an interested layperson trying to be careful on both sides,
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.960]   trying to be prudent, but also cautious. It leaves me often in a place of not knowing
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:05:00.160]   who to trust or how to trust anybody. And it leaves me, I guess, not knowing who to
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.720]   trust and how. Any suggestions for dealing with that?
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:13.760]   And Josh, I feel like this is how we layperson feels when it comes to a financial advisor,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.440]   somebody who can give us financial advice because we go to somebody. I've talked about
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.440]   this before, but I've had about three other financial advisors at first who were really
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.600]   just more keen on selling me something. And I'm not saying they were bad. They probably
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.320]   weren't bad, but they just kept wanting to sell me on stuff. And they didn't sell me
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.080]   on good stuff. I've made my mistakes in the past, but I learned from that. I learned and
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.280]   I made mistakes and I researched it and I listened to good podcasts. I went on good
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.080]   websites and now I have an awesome financial advisor who is great, who gives me very objective
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.840]   information. He gives me options and he's like, "Hey, dude, it's your money, man.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.960]   You got to decide. But these are the things that I know and these are the things that
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.000]   I'm good at and this is what I recommend. But you should do what you do."
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.240]   And so I think it's the same for you guys out there. When you go to your doctor first,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.960]   get the sense. Is this person just burnt out and just wants to get out of the room and
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.480]   is going to throw an antibiotic at you? Or is this somebody who really cares and is going
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.600]   to give you a lot of options? Now, if you put that physician in a bad situation, yeah,
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   they're going to just say, "You know what? Sorry, man. Go see the surgeon, dude, because
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.160]   you're just being a big pain in the ass and you're not working with me and I'm having
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.560]   a hard time with you and I got 30 other patients to see." And recognize that if you go to an
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.480]   orthopedic surgeon, the orthopedic surgeon makes money doing surgery. I mean, we're human.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:49.720]   If I can make $750,000 doing a few knee replacements versus make $350,000 just doing a bunch of
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   crappy office visits, I'm sorry. I would do the knee surgeries. I would do the knee replacements
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.240]   because the patients want them. They're begging for them. They're fighting for them. It's
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.080]   really tough as a surgeon to say, "No, ma'am. You don't need it." No, of course not, because
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.600]   you got $300,000 tied to it. You're going to do it.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.240]   Right. Same conflict of interest in the financial advisor space. People don't – and I would
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.280]   imagine at least what I have observed is you get a little bit callous over time. No matter
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.600]   how much you care in the beginning, when you tell people – so let's say that somebody
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.880]   comes out and they become an orthopedic surgeon and they know that weight loss and walking
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.720]   is the primary thing that they should prescribe, they prescribe weight loss and walking again
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.000]   and again and again and again and people come back again and again and again and don't
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.520]   take their advice. So finally, I said, "Fine. I'll do the surgery," because you get a
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.960]   little jaded. I think the same thing happens in the financial advisory business where no
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.920]   matter how many times you prescribe budgeting and saving, your clients come back again and
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.200]   again and again and they have more credit card debt. They don't have any savings and
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.240]   they're not doing any budgeting. So finally, you say, "Okay, fine. I'll just sell your
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.760]   products and at least you'll have something," and you start to justify it. Right, wrong,
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.160]   it's tough. Every profession has those challenges.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:08.000]   - And I think as patients or as people, humans, whatever, this is what we can do for ourselves
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.560]   is let's think ahead. What's the most expensive thing in people's lives later on down the
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.040]   road? It's probably either divorce or medical expenses. So the divorce, I can't tell you
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.960]   what to do there, but medical expenses, start eating right. Start being active. Again, you
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.760]   don't have to go crazy exercising. Just start eating a little better. Avoid those really
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:37.160]   rich foods. The foods that are probably the worst for you is anything that's processed.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.440]   Anything animal-based is probably bad for you. Anything that's dense is bad for you.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:47.520]   So pasta, bread, it's probably not good for you. You can have a little bit, sure, but
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.240]   only if the majority of what you're eating is really healthy. Do you need organic, not
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.800]   organic? That is such a tiny, tiny factor that I would say once you get eight to 10
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.560]   hours of sleep, once your stress is minimal and once you have some activity, sure, then
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.760]   you can worry about organic, not organic. But the conversation around that is just silly
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:16.280]   right now. So lose some weight. Lose enough weight that you feel good. And you can sense
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.000]   it in your body. When you have a little bit less weight around your neck, you're breathing
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.960]   better. You're sleeping better at night because your pharynx isn't collapsing on itself and
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.400]   making you get sleep apnea. Your belly doesn't feel as much pressure. So then when you're
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.160]   sitting, you don't feel so much pressure against your heart. So get a sense of that in your
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.400]   body. And I think these are the things that if you start doing now, if you build a little
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.680]   bit of muscle mass, if you build a little bit of elasticity in your tendons and your
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.960]   joints, fine, no big deal. Your knee gives out later on in life. It's okay. It's still
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.800]   going to go for a long time and you can probably avoid a lot of surgeries.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:10:00.520]   Paul: Two final things and then final words. One, on the topic of losing weight, do you
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.200]   recommend to people a certain way of doing that, a certain particular style of diet?
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.920]   Do you take a general approach? How do you advise people to consider that?
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.320]   Dr. Seheult: I mean, I usually sit down and I ask them what is it that they're already
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.360]   doing? And then I tell them, you know, diversify it, right? That's what you would tell your
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.080]   clients probably is just try a bunch of different things. Not only be more active and get more
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.480]   sleep, but also change your diet to a little bit less meat, to a little bit less bread
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.000]   and rice. And that alone is going to make you drop a lot of weight. So I usually tell
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.320]   them to just start doing the diet more than the exercise because no matter how much you
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   run, I mean, you can run on a treadmill for an hour running from the police, you know,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.920]   you're not going to, you're going to get maybe 200, 300 calories out of that. But diet, that's
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.760]   huge. You can lose, you can get a lot more bang for your buck just focusing on your diet.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:01.560]   So that's my big one. I say, do your diet, be active. And with diet, I usually just ask
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.680]   them what they eat and I identify like two or three things that are bad for them. And
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.000]   I'm like, that's it. You're done with that. You know, if you're going to have it, you're
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.760]   going to have it once a week in a very small amount that way you're not withdrawing from
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:19.440]   it. But that's my big one. And that's what I think has worked for my patients that have
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440]   followed through.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:26.080]   With regard to sleep, I've seen people advocate just simply the sleep diet. I don't remember
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.560]   the name of the book. I didn't read it. I just read the, some reviews of it. But the
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:37.840]   whole point was if you just start sleeping more, you'll probably result in a lost weight.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.560]   I know for me, this has been a big one where I've learned I've wanted so, I want to be
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.200]   productive. I want to be, I want to have a high degree of output, but I've learned that
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:55.760]   I can't get by on six hours of sleep. I need more. And so I had to be really, really diligent
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:00.720]   about getting to bed on time. And I want so much to produce things, but I just get run
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.620]   down and I get run down. I get my brain stops functioning. I lose my creativity and my sense
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.920]   of sharpness. And then over time, give it a few days. If I give it a few days, then
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:17.840]   I get physically sick if I don't sleep. And so I've told my wife, I said, "Honey, don't
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.160]   ever let me stay up late because I'll get excited about a project." And I'll say, "Oh,
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.360]   miss this once." And then I go ahead and push through and then I regret it. So we've got
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.240]   a deal. I'm never allowed to stay up late. But just a couple more brief comments on the
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.240]   value of sleep.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.400]   - I'll say one last thing about sleep. And it's great, the fact that you're relating
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.480]   that personal experience from it. It makes so much sense, right? Restful sleep is so
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.080]   much more important than how many hours you get. So making sure that right before you
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.320]   go to bed, you don't want to be dealing with something really complex. It's just not possible.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   You need a wind down time and a wind up time, right? When you get home, go crazy, do your
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.960]   work, do whatever you have to do. And right before sleep, really wind down, start having
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.640]   positive thoughts. And just especially when you're dealing with a big problem that you
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:13.120]   really need to solve, the best thing you can do is just completely forget about it. Don't
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.560]   let those intrusive thoughts in, sleep on it, and your mind can do so much more with
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.680]   it than you can, than you could ever do. And when you have good restful sleep without that
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:30.040]   stressful state, you'll do so much better. Even six hours will go a lot longer than eight
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.420]   hours of crappy sleep. So just that's my part on sleep.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.880]   - Final words of advice.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:44.040]   - Final words of advice. Use your doctor as a consultant, not your crutch. Stop going
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.960]   to the doctors for most things. Really start taking care of your body. Start investing
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:56.920]   in your body. And I think you'll get a lot more, you feel more independent. And when
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.440]   you do go to the doctor, get as much information as you can online, everywhere. People are
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.120]   worried that us doctors hate when you come in with articles from Medscape. No, bring
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.200]   it, dude. I'm not, shoot. I love looking at it and say, "Oh, I didn't even think about
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:17.400]   that." But no, you definitely don't have Chagas disease. You're fine. And yeah, exercise,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.280]   diet, sleep, of course. That's it. That's all I got.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.520]   - Mohamed, I thank you for coming on. You are building a website at urgentcarecareer.com,

[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:46.040]   - I think so. I'm seeing a lot more people being drawn to more holistic type of medicine.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:53.120]   I feel like we're making disease less of an enemy. So I do. I feel very positive about
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   it, actually.
