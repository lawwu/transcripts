[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Continuing our study of the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, we come
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   this evening to verses 18, 19, and 20.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.480]   Verses 18, 19, and 20 in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:30.800]   "There is no fear of God before their eyes. Now we know that what thing soever the law
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.680]   saith, it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.920]   the world may become guilty before God. Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.280]   be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.720]   Now we find ourselves at this particular point, you remember, in our analysis of this great
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.360]   chapter. We still have to deal with verse 18, which belongs, rarely, to the section
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:20.560]   that began, you remember, at verse 10, where the apostle began giving us a series of quotations
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:29.280]   to prove his contention that the whole world is under sin. That is his point just here,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.440]   you remember. He wants to establish and to prove that the Jew is as much under the wrath
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   of God as is the Gentile. And, as we have seen, he has been working out a great argument
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.360]   since the 18th verse of the first chapter. But he has worked out the detailed arguments
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.440]   and now he is clinching the matter by bringing forward a number of proofs from the scripture.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.560]   It was a very wise and a very effective thing to do with the Jews, who boasted in their
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   scriptures and in their knowledge of the scriptures. So the apostle says, "Your own scriptures
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.460]   are proving this very thing." And so we have been looking at this list of scriptural quotations
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.160]   and we divided them into three groups. The first group in which he describes the actual
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   state and condition of men in sin. That is verses 10, 11, and 12. Then, from verse 13
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.440]   to verse 17, he describes their conduct and their behaviour which result from that state
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.360]   of sin. And we have dealt with that also. And then we said there was a third division
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.400]   of the quotations which consisted only of this 18th verse, the one we are looking at
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:58.480]   now. And in this verse, the apostle gives us the cause of it all, the real explanation,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.520]   both of the state of men in sin and of the actions of which he is guilty because he is
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.040]   in that state of sin. Now, it is a very wonderful list of quotations, therefore, you see. We
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.200]   have had this description, this terrible description, of the sinful state itself. Then we have seen
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.840]   what men does because of that, because of the state of his heart. He does certain things
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.600]   in words, in speech, and he does certain other things in action. And we have seen the result
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.720]   of all that to the individual and to the world in which he lived.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.000]   But now I say in this 18th verse, he tells us why all this is true. And here is the statement.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.760]   There is no fear of God before their eyes. Now, that is really the explanation of everything.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.560]   That is perhaps the commonest thing which the Bible has to say about men in sin, that
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   there is no fear of God before his eyes. Actually, the apostle here is quoting from the 36th
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.360]   Psalm and the first verse, where we read this, "The transgression of the wicked saith within
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.040]   my heart that there is no fear of God before his eyes." Now, we must just glance for a
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.720]   moment at that verse because people generally find it an extremely difficult verse to understand.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:48.280]   "The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of God before
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.240]   his eyes." What's it mean? Well, it's rather an odd construction. You can translate it,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:06.760]   if you like, like this, "The dictum of depravity concerning the wicked in my heart is that
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:17.520]   there is no fear of God before his eyes." What he means is this. His depravity reveals
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.940]   to my heart that there is no fear of God before his eyes. It's rather an odd form of speech,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.760]   and yet it is, in a sense, a very effective one. He says, I look at those wicked people
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.240]   and I see their depravity. I see the sort of thing they do. Now, he says, their very
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.960]   way of living, their depravity, is speaking to me. And what their depravity tells me about
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.000]   them is that there is no fear of God before their eyes. Now, that's really the meaning
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.680]   of the exposition of that first verse of the thirty-sixth Psalm. You see, he is personalising
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.520]   their depravity, as it were. He says their depravity is speaking. Their depravity is
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.480]   revealing something. It's telling me something. And the message that their depravity gives
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.640]   me is that there is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:22.520]   So the apostle takes up that quotation, and he says this is ultimately the explanation
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:31.560]   of why man is as he is in sin, and why, by way of consequence, the world is as it is.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.120]   The real trouble with men is that there is no fear of God before their eyes. Now, this
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.280]   is undoubtedly the big thing which the Bible says everywhere about sin and about men in
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.680]   sin. It puts it the other way round by putting it like this. What is the basis of true religion?
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.320]   What is the first and greatest characteristic of a godly man? Well, you can put it in this
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:07.080]   way. How often is this statement made in the Old Testament? The fear of the Lord is the
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.000]   beginning of wisdom. You'll find it in the Psalms, you'll find it in the Book of Proverbs,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.560]   you'll find it stated in different ways in many other places. The fear of the Lord is
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   the beginning of wisdom. That is the essence of wisdom. That's well in the foundation
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.400]   of all knowledge. If you haven't got that at the foundation, the beginning, well then
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   you'll go wrong everywhere else. And of course that is the thing that is so patently
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.120]   wrong in the world today. The fear of the Lord doesn't come into so-called human wisdom
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.360]   at all. There is no fear of God before their eyes. Or, listen to the psalmist putting it
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   in quite a striking phrase in the 16th Psalm and in the 8th verse. Here is a wise man,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:08.040]   you see. This is what he says, "I have set the Lord always before me." Now, that's
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.600]   the exact opposite of what we've got here. There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:23.720]   The psalmist said, "I have set the Lord God always before me." Now, says this man
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.820]   in the 16th Psalm, the secret of my life is just this. I always set God before my eyes.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.320]   I keep God, as it were, in front of me. Now, he puts it in that way. It's a very good
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.040]   way, I think, of putting it. It doesn't mean that he sees God with his literal, physical,
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:48.680]   material eyes, but what he means is this. I always recollect the being of God. It's
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.960]   as it were, as if I drew a picture of God and always put it in front of me. Well, you
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.320]   and I do that same thing. Well, I say we do. People used to do it. They don't do it as
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.000]   much as they used to. People used to hang texts on their walls. And, you know, there's
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.640]   something to be said for it. So that as you are seated at your table, or as you wake up
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.000]   in the morning, you look at the wall opposite, and there is a statement, "The fear of the
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.680]   Lord is the beginning of wisdom." There is value in these things. It's God's Word. It
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   reminds us. Well, now, you set that kind of Word before yourself to remind yourself, and
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.480]   as it were, you are setting God before your eyes. Now, this wicked man, he doesn't do
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:41.120]   this. There is no fear of God before his eyes. What does it mean then in practice? Well,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   we can put it in this way. This fear that the text speaks about, of course, doesn't
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:02.160]   mean that all unbelievers are entirely devoid of any fear of God. Sometimes they're very
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.920]   afraid of God. But still, though they may be afraid of God in that sense, and afraid
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.840]   of what God may do to them, and afraid of judgment and so on, the fear that we are talking
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.480]   about here is somewhat different. It's the reverential awe. It's what the author of the
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:28.400]   epistle to the Hebrews means when he says in Hebrews 12, 28, "Let us approach him with
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   reverence and with godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire." That's what he means.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.600]   It's reverence. It's godly fear. It's not a fear that hath torment, but it is what you
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.740]   may describe as awe, or a reverential awe. And that, of course, is something that should
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:56.000]   characterize our approach to God always. That is the way in which Christians should
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.920]   approach God. I'm emphasizing this because I find so often that today they don't. They
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.840]   think that the way to show that you've got assurance of faith is to be glib, and to rush
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   into the presence of God. But it's utterly unscriptural. It is Christians that are exalted
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.960]   in the epistle to the Hebrews to approach God with reverence and with godly fear, for
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   our God is a consuming fire. Very well, what does it mean? Well, it means
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   something like this, that we should always have a sense of God's greatness, and God's
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:40.280]   glory, and God's majesty. You see, this unbeliever hasn't got this. There is no fear of God before
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.040]   his eyes. The believer is to be the exact opposite. He is to have this fear of God,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.000]   this reverence and godly fear. He starts by realizing the glory of God, the greatness
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.320]   and the might and the majesty of God. So that really, the more we know God and the more
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:11.880]   truly pious we are, the less inclined shall we be probably in prayer to say, "Dear God,"
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:19.960]   but more inclined to say with the Lord Jesus Christ, "Holy Father."
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   Reverence and godly fear. The more we realize something of the being of God, the more we
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.920]   shall realize the importance of treading carefully. You remember what God said to Moses in the
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.280]   burning bush, "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet." He was about to investigate, "Take
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:45.520]   off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground." That's
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.080]   it, reverence and godly fear because of his greatness and his majesty.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:58.800]   And the next element in this fear is a desire to worship God, and a desire to praise his
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:10.320]   name with awe. It is the glory in God. It is the desire to commune with God. "This is
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.980]   life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:24.440]   hast sent. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:31.080]   The man who has the fear of God in his heart is a man who desires God, and to be in the
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:38.480]   presence of God, and to draw near to God. The next element is, of course, a consciousness
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:47.880]   that God is the judge of all the earth, and that we are all in his hands. I wonder how
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:56.920]   often these thoughts dominate in our thinking about God. Again, let me quote the epistle
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:04.160]   to the Hebrews, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:11.680]   Why is it, I wonder, that these great declarations of Scripture seem to have dropped out of our
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.920]   modern evangelical vocabulary? It was the great characteristic of the prayer life and
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.720]   the worship of our fathers, but this seems to have gone. But it is scriptural, and as
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.400]   I say, you see it supremely in the prayer life of our blessed Lord himself. We must
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:37.240]   never forget that God is the judge of all the earth. Judgment must begin at the house
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:45.640]   of God. These are scriptural statements made to believing people in the New Testament.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.980]   So we must never lose that element, that however confident we are, and whatever boldness we
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:58.720]   may have as we go to the throne of grace, it should never be at the expense of a realization
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.960]   of these tremendous truths about the being and the character of God.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:14.000]   And lastly, of course, there is this element of the fear of punishment. The trouble with
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.120]   this man of the world, before whose eyes there is no fear of God, is that he cares not about
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:29.560]   God nor men, he says. He is bold and he is arrogant. He dismisses the Bible. He blasphemes
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.920]   the name of God. He sins without a fear. He says, I fear neither God nor men. How often
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:43.000]   have we heard people saying that? It is all due to his ignorance, of course. He does not
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.440]   realize what he is saying. If he but knew something about God, he would be silenced
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   immediately. But there is no fear of God before his eyes. He has no sense of God's greatness.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.920]   He does not desire God. He does not realize that God is his judge. He does not realize
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:11.040]   that when he dies, and at the end of time, there will be a last and a final judgment,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:19.160]   and that God has power, as our Lord said, not only to destroy the body, but to cast
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:28.720]   both soul and body into hell. What a terrible thing. But that is the position of men and
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.960]   women who have never been convicted of sin, who are not Christians. They are men of the
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:42.560]   world, and here is the final trouble with them. No fear of God before their eyes. And
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   it is because of that, you see, that their hearts are as they are, and they do the things
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.360]   they do. It is the cause of war. It is the cause of all the horrible things that we have
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.680]   seen as we have been working through this list. It is the cause of lust and passion.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.840]   It is the cause of lawlessness. It is the cause of the muddle in this country and in
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   the life of every other country at this present hour. No fear of God before their eyes. That
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:15.400]   is the ultimate explanation of it all. Very well. There we finish our consideration of
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:22.920]   this great chain, this great list of quotations from the Old Testament.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:30.720]   And that brings us to a consideration of verses 19 and 20, which just go on their own. And
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:38.280]   they are two tremendously important verses, because in these two verses the apostle does
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.440]   quite a number of things. The first thing he does is that he sums up what he has been
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:53.280]   just quoted. He makes a statement on the basis of his own quotations. But it isn't merely
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.360]   that. It is, at the same time, the summing up of the entire paragraph which began in
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:07.960]   chapter 1, verse 18. And we must never lose sight of that fact. This great argument starts
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:14.160]   at verse 18 of chapter 1 and goes right the way through to chapter 3, verse 20. There
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.560]   is but one theme in it, and that is this wrath of God which is upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.760]   of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness. And the apostle, I say, has been just setting
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.520]   out to prove that that is a statement which can be demonstrated, that it is as true of
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.800]   Jews as it is of Gentiles. Now then, he says, I have given you all my arguments, I have
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.880]   worked up my evidence, here is what I say. Now, we know, there is no need to argue about
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.960]   this, everybody is agreed here, that what thingsoever the law saith, it saith to them
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:59.040]   who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.520]   before God. Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.720]   sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:21.960]   Now I say that these two verses really are of very crucial importance. They are absolutely
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.560]   vital and essential to an understanding of the great doctrine which the apostle is going
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   to begin unfolding in verse 21, the great and central doctrine of justification by faith
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.920]   only, and the great doctrine of the atonement that is included in the paragraph. If we do
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.440]   not understand the argument of these two verses, we will never understand that. Therefore,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.160]   we must look at these. Now let us look at verse 19 for a moment.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.440]   "Now we know that what thingsoever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:05.760]   law." There is rarely no great difficulty about that. There has been a bit of argument
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:13.200]   as to what the term law means, whether it just means the law of Moses, or whether it
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.840]   means the whole of the Old Testament scriptures. There is a good deal to be said for both points
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.800]   of view. Personally, I tend to agree with those who say that it means the whole of the
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:33.760]   Old Testament, and I say that because of the context. The apostle in the second verse said
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.760]   that one of the great advantages of the Jews was that they had committed unto them, entrusted
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.400]   to them, the oracles of God, which we said again probably meant the whole of the Old
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.120]   Testament. In any case, in this list of quotations that
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.240]   the apostle has been giving us, we have noticed that he takes his quotations from the book
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:05.160]   of Psalms and from the Prophets, not strictly speaking from the five books of Moses, which
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:12.360]   are so often referred to as the Law. So that as he has been quoting from Psalms and Prophets,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.880]   and then immediately says the Law, well surely he is referring to the same thing. And sometimes
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:25.760]   in Scripture, the whole of the Old Testament is referred to as the Law, because in the
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.480]   whole of the Old Testament, the Law after all is central. And the Law is very frequently
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.160]   referred to, the Prophets deal with it and show its place and its importance, and the
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.640]   failure of the nation to live according to the Law, and so on. So that there is a great
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.640]   deal to be said for regarding it as the whole of the Old Testament. But in the end, of course,
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.280]   it does not really matter very much whether you take it to mean the whole of the Old Testament
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:22:00.880]   or simply the Law of Moses. But what the apostle is asserting is this,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:08.680]   that the Law particularly speaks to those who are under the Law. If you take it as Old
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:15.440]   Testament, it means this now, the Old Testament, of course, is primarily addressed to the Jews.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.700]   It was given to them, the other people had not got it, so it could not speak to them.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.280]   But it was given to the Jews, and therefore it speaks to the Jews. So whether it is Old
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:31.360]   Testament as a whole, or whether it is just the Law of Moses, the contention is that this
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   speaks particularly to those to whom it was given. And therefore, what he is saying is
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:49.960]   this, the very oracles of God of which the Jews boasted, prove in and of themselves that
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:59.000]   the Jews are under condemnation, and are as much under the wrath of God as are the Gentiles.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.400]   That is the thing you remember he wants to prove. The Jew believed that the Gentile was
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   under the wrath of God, but that because he was a member of the chosen race, that he wasn't
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.800]   under the wrath of God. Now then, says Paul, I have given you the list of quotations, they
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.440]   are from your own Law, they are from your own oracles, and they are the very things
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:25.080]   that prove that you are under condemnation. Therefore, these very oracles of which you
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:34.720]   boast, are the very word of God that prove that you have nothing at all of which to boast
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.840]   in the matter of salvation. In other words, what he is saying is this, he says, well now
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.320]   there then, I have proved to you that you Jews are all coming short of the glory of
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.400]   God. There I have demonstrated to you that you are all sinners, and if I have demonstrated
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.840]   that you are sinners, how much more so are the Gentile sinners. That is the real meaning
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:09.120]   of the argument at that point. Very well then, why has he done this? Why has he been at such
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.440]   great pains to prove that the Jews are under the wrath of God in exactly the same way as
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:23.840]   the Gentiles? Well, he tells us here that he has two objects in view in doing it, and
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:34.640]   he claims that he has done it. Here is the first, that every mouth may be stopped. Now
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:43.480]   that is rather a striking phrase, and a very important one. What he is saying, in other
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:49.760]   words, can be put like this. I have gone through all this argumentation, says the apostle,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.520]   and I have ended and wound up by giving these quotations, so that I shall put an end to
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:04.900]   all talking and arguing and debating and disputation once and forever. I want to silence every
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:12.840]   mouth. I want to put a hand over every mouth that is anxious to speak for itself. He says,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:19.520]   my object has been to render the whole world speechless. Now the best way perhaps we can
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.400]   look at it is this. What is the point of all this argument? What is the point of these
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:37.480]   scriptural quotations? Well, if you like, it is just this. It is to silence that kind
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.480]   of Pharisee that our Lord depicted there in that parable of the Pharisee and the publican
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.080]   that went up into the temple to pray, which you find in Luke chapter 18, beginning at
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:55.960]   verse 9. You remember the story, don't you? The Pharisee goes up to the temple and he
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.040]   walks right to the front and he begins to speak. God, I thank thee! And he pours out
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.280]   his eloquence, describing himself, what a good man he was, how unlike this publican,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:13.000]   how unlike other people, what he does, what he doesn't do. And he talks, and he is voluble,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.800]   and he is eloquent, he is talking constantly. My object, says the apostle, is just to silence
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:29.000]   people like that, that every mouth may be stopped. That is not the way to approach God.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.800]   The right way to approach God is the way of the publican who could not so much as lift
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:42.480]   up his face to him, but there he is smiting his breast and saying, God have mercy upon
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:49.120]   me a sinner. Now that is my object, says the apostle, or if you like, take the so-called
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:56.000]   rich young ruler. Here is another man who is very ready to speak. All these things have
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   I kept from my youth up. Oh, I know all about it, and he is ready to talk and to justify
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.160]   himself. And do you notice what our Lord does with him again, is to just speak to him in
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.000]   such a way that he silences him. Here is a man who says, I have done it all. Ah, said
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:20.480]   our Lord, one thing thou lackest, go sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:33.760]   come take up the cross and follow me. And he had nothing to say. He just went away sorrowful.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.840]   What has happened? Well, his mouth has been stopped. He was full of arguments, full of
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.880]   self-defense, self-justification. What must I do? Full of self-conflict. Our Lord speaks
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:54.800]   in such a way that he silences him. His mouth is stopped. And the whole value of this great
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   section of Scripture that we have been working our way through is really just to do that,
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:09.760]   to render us speechless, to take away every desire to assert ourselves, or to say, "Wait
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.840]   a minute, I have done this, I have done that, wait a minute, haven't you forgotten this?"
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.200]   Every mouth has been stopped. There is no argument left. All the arguments have been
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:24.560]   answered. The ground has been taken from beneath our feet. We have got nothing to say. Every
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:36.880]   mouth shall be stopped. Now, how have these Scriptures done this? Well, I suggest to you
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:44.800]   that they have done it like this. You see, we are summing up the entire great section.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:52.760]   The Scriptures have shown us what God is like. My dear friends, the trouble with all of us
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:03.560]   is that we don't know God. What a tremendous talker Job was, and oh, how much he had got
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.400]   to say. He said, "Oh, I knew, oh, that I knew where I might find him." The trouble
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.920]   is, says Job, "If only I could get at God and tell him and put up my case, but I can't
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.960]   find him. Isn't there somebody, isn't there a daysman somewhere that can bring me into
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.080]   his presence? Can't I have a fair hearing? I am suffering here. Oh, that I might state
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:32.840]   my case. I am having a hard time." And then, you remember, the time came when Job found
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   himself in the presence of God. God began to speak to him, and you remember the marvellous
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:47.320]   thing that happened. Job put his hand upon his mouth. He stopped his own mouth. He said,
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:54.360]   "I had heard of thee with the hearing of the ear, but now…" And having come into
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:01.160]   the presence of God, and having realised the glory and the greatness and the majesty and
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.400]   the holiness of God, poor Job doesn't want to say a word. He puts his hand. He'd been
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.360]   speaking foolishly. He'd been speaking thoughtlessly. It was a theoretical knowledge of God, but
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.320]   now he's in the presence of God, and he puts his hand upon his mouth. He stopped his own
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:23.000]   mouth. If you and I have really understood all these
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   verses that we've been considering, from chapter 1, verse 18 to this point, it should
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:44.400]   have brought us to that. We realise also what God demands. These verses show us the standard,
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.360]   and the standard of God, you see, is not a negative one. It isn't just that we should
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.320]   be better than the people who are outside the church, or better than the modernists
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.600]   and others in the church. No, no, it's a positive standard.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:15.480]   and all thy strength and thy neighbour as thyself. And the moment we realise that that's
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:22.720]   the demand, there's nothing to be said. Every mouth is stopped. So much easier to be better
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:32.080]   than other people, but that isn't the test. It's this totalitarian demand of God.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:39.040]   And then you notice the Scriptures have been searching us and have been analysing our hearts.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:45.400]   The last two Friday nights we've been looking at these quotations and we've seen the real
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:52.040]   state of the natural unregenerate heart, none righteous, none that understandeth, all gone
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:58.280]   out of the way. Throat an open sepulcher, tongues using deceit, poison of asps under
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:04.200]   the lips, mouth full of cursing and bitterness, feet swift to shed blood, destruction and
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:14.880]   misery in all our ways. No peace, no fear of God. We've seen ourselves, and the whole
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:25.160]   of mankind. And you see, when you've seen these things, you don't want to speak, do
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:34.280]   you? In the presence of God, you're silenced. And in the presence of the blackness of your
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:41.320]   own heart, you're silenced. What help is it to be a little bit better than somebody
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:50.480]   else, if you yourself are so black and so vile, so wretched, so hopeless?
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.680]   Now there are the effects of the Scripture. That's my first motive, says Paul, that
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:08.200]   every mouth shall be stopped. I make no apology for asking, even in a service like this. Have
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:16.800]   you stopped speaking? Have you been silenced in the presence of God? Have you given up
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:24.280]   self-justification? Have you given up arguing against this verdict of the great Apostle?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.040]   And saying, "But surely, after all, I've done this good and that, I'm not as bad
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.200]   as that." If you're saying that, you've missed the Scripture, because the effect
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.640]   of this Scripture is to silence, stop every mouth. If you're still wanting to say, "Yes,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:46.200]   but," you haven't understood the Scripture. The effect of an understanding of these Scriptures
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:54.360]   is to silence them. You've just got to say, "It's true. I have nothing to say.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:00.480]   I give up. I give in." If you like, you can put it in terms of that
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:10.160]   verse in the 46th Psalm, "Be still, and know that I am God." And when we know that
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:18.320]   he is God, we will be still. There's nothing to say in the presence of God. And therefore,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.360]   I say once more that if we are not silenced, it's because we haven't understood the
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.720]   Scriptures, and it is because we haven't really known God.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.960]   The second object that he has in view is this, "That the whole world may become guilty
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:47.480]   before God." Now you notice he says again, "the whole world." In other words, he's
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:55.960]   anxious to prove the universality of the condemnation. Jews as well as Gentiles. Every mouth, the
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:03.200]   whole world, there isn't a single exception. Every man born into this world since Adam
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:11.640]   and Eve fell is in this condition. No exceptions. None at all.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:17.440]   Now then, what does this word "guilty" mean? It's a very important word in the
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:27.120]   understanding of the apostles' doctrine, as I say. Now, this word, translated "guilty,"
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:35.920]   is a very old word that is only used on this one occasion in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.240]   It isn't used anywhere else. There are other words that are used to translate "guilty,"
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:48.040]   but this particular word is only found in this one particular place. What does it mean?
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.280]   Well, there's no doubt the apostle chose it quite deliberately, because it is a legal
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:36:03.120]   term, or if you prefer it, it is a forensic term. It's a term that must ever be associated
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   with the law court and with legal performances, and the apostle deliberately brings it in
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   here because he is anxious to say this. It means being answerable to God. It means being
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:29.280]   liable before God. It means being liable to and exposed to the punishment of God on account
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:35.720]   of sin. Now, you can see the importance of this argument
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:44.440]   with respect to the whole question of justification. The whole world has thus been proved to be
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:52.400]   liable in the presence of God, liable to the court. There's a prosecution. You are liable
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.320]   in law. You've done something, and you're liable. You've got an answer to make. You
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:02.360]   are called to appear on a charge. You must give an answer. That's the connotation of
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:10.200]   the word. And what the apostle says is that the whole world is guilty before God.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:19.160]   Now then, this is where we must be careful. It is essential to the understanding of the
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:25.880]   doctrine of justification to which he is going to bring us that we should understand that
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:34.800]   being guilty means just that. It's purely a legal and a forensic idea. In other words,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.480]   what he's saying here that his object in all that he's been arguing about is not so much
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.760]   to prove that we are in a rotten state inside ourselves, that we are polluted as the result
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:54.560]   of sin. We are. That is all perfectly true. But what he is really trying to prove is this,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:03.400]   that we are liable, that we are answerable, that we are under the condemnation and under
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:10.720]   the wrath of God. And what the apostle says is that that is the state and the condition
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:18.320]   of the whole of mankind, that the whole world may become guilty before God, not before men.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.880]   We are not being tried by men, but we are being tried by God. And he says what I've
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.200]   been proving is that the whole world is guilty before God, answerable, liable, under the
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.620]   charge and can't answer.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:43.560]   Now that is what the law proves. You notice I must say it again because it's essential
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:51.720]   to an understanding of this doctrine of justification. It isn't enough just to know that there's
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.280]   something wrong inside you. It isn't enough just to know and to admit that you're not
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.340]   everything that you might be and everything that you ought to be. It isn't that. What
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:08.920]   Paul has been bringing us to see is this, that we are all guilty before God, quite apart
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.640]   from our inward state which is vile, which is rotten and so on. The great thing which
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:19.240]   he set out to prove in chapter 1 verse 18 is this, that the wrath of God is revealed
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:25.400]   from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. We are in the law court. We are in
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   the assizes. The judge is on the bench. This is the thing, guilt. Not so much pollution
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:37.640]   here that will come later. It's guilt. It's our standing before God and not so much our
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.500]   own internal condition.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:48.320]   Why do I emphasize this? Well, I say that I'm emphasizing it because if we don't grasp
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.360]   this, we won't grasp justification. Not only that, but we won't be able to evangelize truly
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:04.280]   if we don't realize this. What is the first need of men? What does any man in the world
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   tonight who is not a Christian need first and foremost? "Ah," says somebody, "isn't
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:17.200]   it to be better? Isn't it to be a better man? What's the business of the gospel? What's
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:24.440]   the first message of the gospel? Is it to make men better?" I say, "No, it isn't."
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.600]   That's not the first need of men. That's not the first message of the gospel.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:34.800]   "Well, I wonder," says somebody else, "whether it's this. Isn't the first need of men the
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.120]   need of help?" Here he is battling against temptations and problems and difficulties.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.960]   Surely the first need of every man is to be helped. He's too weak. "Isn't the first
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.560]   message of the gospel, therefore, to present Christ to them as someone who can help them
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.920]   to live life and its battles, and to conquer Christ as a helper?" No, it isn't the first
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:04.560]   thing. "Well, surely," says someone, "the first trouble with men is to get rid of himself.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:11.600]   Isn't self the first and the greatest problem? And shouldn't the gospel in the first instance
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:17.760]   therefore tell men how to get rid of this self that mars and ruins everything?" Again
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:25.640]   I say, "No, that is not its business," according to the apostle. "The first trouble with men
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:33.760]   is that he's guilty. He does need to be better. He does need help. He does need to get rid
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.520]   of self. I know he does, but before any one of those things, he needs to be put right
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:48.920]   with God. Let me prove it to you." Thank God the gospel does offer to make us better.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:57.200]   It promises to do it. It promises us endless help through the power of Christ in the Spirit.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:03.320]   It shows us a way of getting rid of this horrid self that is in all of us. Yes, but my dear
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:12.960]   friend, all that applies to the future. What if you died in another minute? There'd be
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.880]   no time for you to get better. There'd be no time for you to experience this help of
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.360]   Christ. There'd be no time to get rid of sin. What if you're in the position of the thief
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.640]   dying upon the cross, who's going to be dead, as it were, in a moment? What then? Ah, you
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:38.720]   see, you must start with that. Man's first trouble, man's first problem, is his relationship
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:46.200]   to God, is the fact that he is a sinner, a guilty sinner in the presence of God. It's
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.520]   his guilt that comes first. He's answerable. He's a soul, and he goes out of this life
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.320]   into the next, and he stands before God. It may happen at any moment. Therefore, that
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   must come first. How can I be just with God? How can I stand in the presence of God? That's
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:13.480]   the first thing. So you see why the apostle puts his great emphasis upon this. What I've
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.920]   been setting out to prove in all this argument and in all the quotations, says Paul, is just
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:24.400]   this, that as you stand before God, you're silenced, and you realize that you're guilty.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.520]   There is the demand, and you can't answer it, but you are answerable. You're liable.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's not you saying, "I'm not aware of the law," but the law has been given either through
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:41.240]   Moses or else you've got this that's in your heart, this moral sense, and you're answerable.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:49.760]   Can you answer? You cannot answer. In other words, you are guilty. You're called to answer.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:57.520]   You're liable in law, and you can do nothing about it. You are guilty. That every mouth
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:11.000]   should be stopped, and that the whole world might become guilty before God.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   Ah, my friends, let us never forget this. The first thing that the gospel of Christ
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:27.760]   does is to enable us to escape from the wrath to come. That's the first thing. The first
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:34.920]   problem is how to escape condemnation, so that if you're speaking to a highly moral,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.720]   good, philanthropic person who never seems to have done any harm to anybody and is always
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.560]   doing good, but who doesn't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, what you say is this, "Is
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.720]   there this fear of God before your eyes? How do you stand before God?" Don't talk about
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.840]   their lives. Talk about their status, their standing, their position face to face with
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:09.040]   God in the judgment, and there they, like everybody else, are guilty. They cannot answer.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:24.280]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. The whole world is guilty before God.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:41.720]   O Lord our God, we know not what to say in thy holy presence. We confess that we have
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   all been guilty of this much speaking. We have been like that Pharisee. We have tried
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:57.360]   to defend ourselves and to justify ourselves. O God, we thank thee again that thou hast
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:03.440]   brought us to the end of that and to see that we can do nothing, that we are guilty with
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:10.000]   all others before thee and in thy sight, and that we have no answer that we can give in
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:20.280]   and of ourselves. O God, we thank thee as we part from one another and in thy holy presence,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:32.880]   that we can say from our hearts, "On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   sinking sand." We thank thee for him who is our only plea, our only answer. We thank
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:54.760]   thee for the blood of Christ whereby thou hast reconciled us unto thyself while we were
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:06.240]   yet sinners. O God, receive our humble praise. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:13.360]   Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.520]   abide and continue with us, now this night and throughout the remainder of this hour's
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:28.480]   short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
