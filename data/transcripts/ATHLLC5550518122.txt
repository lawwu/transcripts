[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.760]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.960]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and not only am I excited to have you on my
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920]   journey to find all the hacks, but I am really excited to have you here for
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.480]   today's interview because I get to talk to Kristen Berman, who is a top
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   researcher in the field of behavioral economics.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   She co-founded Irrational Labs with famed professor Dan Ariely, where they've
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.160]   worked to bring behavioral science to life inside of hundreds of big and small
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.720]   companies.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.120]   She also co-founded Common Sense Lab at Duke University.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.360]   She was a founding team member at Google's Behavioral Science Unit, and she
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.120]   co-authored a series of workbooks called Hacking Human Nature for Good, a
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   practical guide to changing behavior.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   Finally, she just launched a new podcast called The Science of Change, where she
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160]   talks with the leaders at major companies like Peloton and Credit Karma who are
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   actually changing human behavior today.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.480]   In our conversation, we discuss what research shows about why people act so
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.640]   irrationally, how we can actually start to change our own behaviors, why she
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.280]   thinks habits are overrated, and hear some of her favorite hacks for increasing
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   happiness, whether it's during vacation or at your next dinner party.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.400]   So I hope you enjoy this conversation with Kristen Berman.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.160]   Kristen, thanks for being here.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.200]   I'm very excited to be here.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   So I have heard you speak a few different times, and I think it's so fascinating
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.160]   how people are completely irrational in many cases, even though a lot of what
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   we've talked about on our show is about doing things the rational way, because
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000]   it makes sense and you can earn more and save more, but you come with a totally
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.680]   different angle.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480]   So I'd love you to give some background on yourself and how you got into all of
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.800]   this.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.200]   Wonderful.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.680]   So I'm a behavioral scientist, which basically means I study decision-making,
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.280]   but more than that, study basically the mistakes that people make in their
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.960]   decisions.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.520]   And we tend to make a lot of mistakes, and these are for small decisions, they're
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.800]   for big decisions.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.400]   And the reality is, even if you know about these mistakes, it's very hard to
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   avoid them.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.840]   So I may know that social norms influence my behavior, but if everybody else has
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.960]   bought this, you know, one purse or this computer, I may still be influenced to
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.560]   buy it, despite the fact that knowing that I don't want to be influenced by
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.280]   other people.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.800]   So knowing about these biases and these psychologies aren't as helpful as we
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.760]   think to change our behavior.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.520]   And so in behavioral science, the question would be is what is?
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.920]   And that's basically what we study.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   And the punchline tends to be that the environment of decision-making is
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.240]   basically the goldmine here.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   So I may like M&Ms, but if the M&Ms are close to me, I'll eat more of them.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.200]   And if the M&Ms are farther from me with a lid on, I'll eat less.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.440]   So my attitude, preference, and belief for something, these M&Ms in this example,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.840]   matters much less than the environment that they're in.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.400]   And when we understand that, it's very fun because you can basically change your
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.880]   environment.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   You can say, "How do I change my environment to change my behavior?"
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.480]   And with that comes a whole new toolkit of what you can do to improve your life.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.320]   Is it as simple as just changing your environment and boom, that's easy?
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.560]   I now am saving more, eating healthier, and exercising?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.000]   You know, nothing is simple.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I think the difference is basically when you're doing it for yourself, you have to
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   make a one-time decision to change your environment.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.200]   So at some level, your motivation has to be high enough to not buy the chips when
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.280]   you're in the grocery store.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.000]   And that is going to be easier than buying the chips and trying not to eat them
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.560]   every day.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   And so it still takes work, but the work is just different.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.680]   It comes at one point versus, you know, spread out over daily decision making.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680]   Obviously, it's easier if a company does it for us.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.200]   If Facebook would just limit the amount of time that we could spend on it, it'd be
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.120]   easier than us trying to set alerts and notifications that say, "Your screen time
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.080]   is four hours today," and then you have to make a decision about tomorrow.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.400]   It's better if they do it for us, but it's possible we can do it for ourselves.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   And that's the upside here.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.080]   Are there some examples of things that people often do wrong and ways that they
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.000]   could start to improve them to make life more intentional?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.040]   Yeah, I mean, just talking about finances is interesting.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.240]   I think if people spent a weekend setting up their account structure in a better way
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480]   that they would make better financial decisions.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.840]   We tend to think that we can spend less, save more, and make this as a daily or
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   monthly decision.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.080]   And a better way to do this is an account structure that automatically saves every
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.400]   month into an investment account or automatically saves into your goal account
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.360]   and potentially creating more rules of thumb for yourself by which you're not
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.680]   using your credit card for small expenses.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320]   Although I know that for points people, that's probably a sin.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.680]   But for many people, you should not use your credit card for small expenses.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   And so there are different ways to do this, and especially for finances.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   But it does take some upfront motivation to do this.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.960]   And same with eating, you know, we can design our kitchen in better ways.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.720]   I think many times people put the fruits and veggies in the fruit and veggie
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.800]   drawer, which is, you know, it's hard to see them when they go bad.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.280]   And you put this soda on the top shelf, it's very easy to see the soda.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   And so at some level, if you design your fridge so that it's impossible to miss
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   the blueberries that are going bad, more people will eat the blueberries.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.200]   And so we want to think very deeply about our environment and especially the daily
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   environment that we live in to do this.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.560]   Yeah, you mentioned some rules of thumb.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.320]   I'm curious if there are specific rules of thumb.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.200]   Let's start with savings that adopting day to day could change your behavior more
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.440]   easily than just wanting to change it, which it sounds like is impossible.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   Yeah, I actually, well, one thing that annoys me is when people say savings is a
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.760]   habit, like I'm going to create a savings habit.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.440]   It's like savings is not a habit.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.200]   You have to go in there into your account.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.240]   You have to log in, by the way.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.280]   You have to remember your password.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.520]   Most people don't remember their password.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.120]   Then you have to choose how much you want to save and transfer it over.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.240]   And you have to do this on a regular basis.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.680]   And so things like that are just not habits.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.400]   Habits is when you wake up and you drink water or you brush your teeth or you're
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.680]   getting coffee. That's more of a habit.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.160]   Doing a complex behavior at random intervals during the month is not a habit.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.480]   And it's very hard to form at that level.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.360]   In fact, one time they just removed reminders and people stopped saving
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   completely. And so the move for savings is actually just to set up the reoccurring
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.000]   transfer at the time that you get paid.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.640]   And that's critical for most people is to set up at the point you get paid.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.600]   However, banks, terrible, they don't do this.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.560]   There are companies now trying to do this.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.120]   Chime, I think, has it timed with your deposits.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.040]   I believe Digit has it timed with your deposits at some level.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.600]   And so I think the rule of thumb for savings is about reoccurring transfers
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.800]   timed with your deposits.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.040]   And we tend to measure in behavioral science process versus outcome.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.560]   So just doing this is the win.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   You get the win if you do this.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.040]   The amount you save now is a different decision.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.280]   But I'd say most people should be setting up the process to get you to build the
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.440]   nest egg and worrying less about getting the absolute right number.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.800]   In fact, I think one mistake people make is trying to get the absolute right
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   number and this prevents them from doing anything.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.240]   And in behavioral science, basically, when there's complexity, we procrastinate.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.320]   And so when you don't save, this is worse than saving the wrong number.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.920]   Yeah. And I've always told people that are struggling to start saving that you
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   could start with a really low number.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.760]   And if it works, you could just raise the number.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.320]   Totally.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.880]   Or maybe in some future world, we could have a product that would just like
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.520]   automatically raise the number every so often.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.800]   And you'd have to choose to stop raising the number because, as I think I've
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   heard you say many times, people are more likely to opt in than opt out.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.480]   Yeah, well, we're more likely to basically take the default.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.600]   So if the default is basically not saving, we're more likely to not save.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.000]   And if the default is to save, we're more likely to save.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.680]   And if it rounds up to a bigger number, if it adds a dollar every week, we're
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.920]   more likely to do this if it's the default.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   But by the way, the other thing, your idea here on getting people to start
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.520]   small is very nice. There was a nice study by Hal Hirschfeld, who basically
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.200]   looked at opt-in rates when saving was either a low number, you could imagine
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.960]   a dollar a week or four dollars a month, or you can imagine ten dollars a week
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.440]   or forty dollars a month, and then annualize that.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.800]   And people opted in when it was in the lower frame.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.480]   So like a per day or per week amount at a higher rate than if it was annualized
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.200]   or monthly. And so basically, that's kind of like a reduced cognitive
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.040]   overload. We can all afford two dollars or something.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.760]   We can all afford three dollars.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.800]   And understanding that gets people more likely to say yes to something.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.160]   And it's so obvious, right?
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.400]   But banks and stuff, we don't think this way.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.760]   We think about annual or monthly.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.960]   Yeah. And how does this change as people move up the savings journey?
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.000]   Is there a similar set of tools that someone can use who maybe has the
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   capability of saving more but isn't?
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.280]   Yeah, I think the same set of tools apply.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.200]   You just want to increase the rate that you're saving.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.440]   So you want to think about what number is coming out of your paycheck every
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.800]   month. And is that going into a diversified account set for you?
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.840]   So I think it's really about amping up the number.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.880]   The other thing is to have decision days where you could say you're going to put
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.000]   something on the calendar and re-evaluate.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.520]   So one thing that we find with finance is people worry a lot.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.320]   And they think they're not doing the right thing.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.800]   And this is kind of sad because in theory, you're just worrying all the time.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.440]   I'd wanted more if people just worry on one day.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.600]   And then at the end of the day, they make a decision.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.720]   So you stress yourself out on a Sunday every three months.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   You make some decision about adding more or withdrawing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.720]   And then you forget it for the next three months.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.920]   We call these more decision points versus kind of overall worrying that you've
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.280]   made some mistake.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.240]   I like that idea, but I find myself and we just had an episode talking about
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.920]   FOBO, which is like the fear of a better option and about decision making.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.320]   And I think sometimes decision making, especially for someone who really wants to
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.800]   be optimal, can be a really stressful process that ends up taking way longer than
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.640]   they want. Are there things you've learned about how people make decisions that
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   could make that process easier and maybe a little more enjoyable?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yes, my partner, my husband is an optimizer and I am not.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.680]   And so I have deep experience with this.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.640]   Sometimes I will set a timer when he's trying to pick something on Amazon.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.160]   And so you have 15 minutes to do this.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.720]   And so, you know, at some level, I'm sure folks, many have heard about the kind of
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.280]   explore-exploit problem.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.960]   Kind of the classic example here is you're on an airplane and either you get a list
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.120]   of movies and which movie do you pick?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.560]   And an optimizer may go through the full list of movies multiple times.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.200]   And by the time they choose a movie, it's too late and they won't be able to finish
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.800]   the movie. The plane will have ended.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.760]   A satisficer may choose too early and not get an optimal movie, but maybe they've
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.640]   finished the movie by the time that the plane has landed.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.200]   And so each basically there are tradeoffs for.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.480]   I think with the optimizer, I worry, especially in a financial construct, that
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   again, not making a decision is worse than making a small wrong decision.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.800]   And so it would basically push yourself to make a decision and have some deadline
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.440]   attached to this. So whether it be, you know, every quarter you make some decision and
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.680]   you have some accountability with somebody else to do this.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.480]   By the way, accountability finances is a thing we just don't talk about that much.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.680]   This is a great podcast to have people talk about it.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.440]   But probably if you're a listener, the question is like, do you know what your mom has
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   in savings? Do you know what your best friend has in savings?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.240]   Like, probably not. And so at some level, these are tend to be private decisions.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.000]   And with private decisions, we can make excuses to procrastinate more.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.280]   So one easy hack is just telling somebody what you're doing.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.800]   And that itself will likely hold you more accountable to doing it.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.680]   A better one would be involving them in the decision and having a bigger conversation
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.360]   about it. Again, it's to make it something from private sphere to public sphere.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.240]   And we tend to actually follow through on our intentions then and act quicker.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.960]   And that doesn't need to be public, like post on Facebook what's in your bank account.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.440]   Yeah. So that's actually... Obviously, many finance companies have tried to be like,
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.200]   "We're going to do social and get people to post."
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.800]   It's like that. Sure, it could work in some cultures. It's probably...
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.120]   We're far from it, at least in the US context.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   It's a lot more about having just real conversations with a person that you trust.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   I do tend to find these conversations are easier to start if you're sharing a tip.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.240]   So most of the time, people don't like to ask for advice.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.520]   So what should I do? How much should I be saving?
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.000]   I think the conversation can start easy if you're like,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   "Hey, I just learned this cool thing about my new bank account or credit card points."
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.000]   And then you've opened up the conversation for another person to share their tip.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.960]   And all of a sudden, you can start talking about finances in a different way.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.320]   Yeah. I think we don't talk about money.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   Obviously, I enjoy doing it or I wouldn't be here and I've encouraged it.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.320]   But I wonder, have you seen any groups online that might in some way be
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.640]   anonymous or maybe personal but with people that aren't actually your friends?
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.800]   Is that something that could be helpful
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.040]   in a space where people aren't comfortable talking to each other?
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.440]   Yeah. Reddit communities for money are incredible.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.360]   The amount of specific advice... Obviously, you want to be skeptical of
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.680]   a lot of random people giving you advice. But at some level, it's a really good
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.040]   forum for getting exposed with your finances.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.240]   You could ask a question right now about "This is how much I have in my
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.440]   account. This is how much I have in debt. What do you think I should do?"
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.720]   And you'll get dozens if not hundreds of people weighing in on your financial situation.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.520]   So I think there's some anonymity that helps people ask for advice that's helpful.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.200]   And just by the way, again, the nature of asking for advice is going to make it from
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.920]   private to public sphere by which you've now made your problem something much,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.720]   much more salient for you to address sooner than later.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.680]   We can always make an excuse to do something next week.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.200]   As soon as you talk about it, it's a little bit harder to make that excuse.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.240]   And that's not just because you've told someone. But is there something that actually happens
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.680]   in your mind, in your brain that makes you feel more responsible versus just know that
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.480]   you've told someone?
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.920]   Yeah. It's a little bit about the reputation. In general, this is why meetings are so
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.720]   lovely. It'd be very hard for me to come to a meeting and say, "I'm so sorry. I just didn't
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.400]   do the PowerPoint. I just totally didn't do it." Because you know that somebody else may
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.920]   ask you about it, you act in a socially desirable way, which is to respond or do the thing that
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.280]   they might ask about.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.840]   So the very understanding that in the future, you may be held accountable for this, even
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:49.520]   if you aren't going to be. But that small percent chance will make us act in a desirable
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.400]   fashion. So we do have this internal reputation that we're always trying to manage and protect,
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.200]   at least for ourselves.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.920]   And we talked about getting things done and committing to get them done and sharing that.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.200]   What about when you have a lot of things? I think one challenge is, I'm an optimizer.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.360]   I want to spend five hours on Amazon. I feel like your husband and I would have a very
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.760]   terrible conversation comparing reviews. You're talking about the movie example. And I'm the
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.880]   person who... I'm like, "Well, we haven't taken off. So I'm online." I'm like, "What's
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.680]   the Rotten Tomatoes score of every single movie? Which one's the highest?" I have that
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:21.920]   problem.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.000]   But also, what about when there's just a lot of things? Are there things you've learned
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.920]   about behavioral psychology that would help people that are like, "I have a to-do list
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.760]   of 50 things. And I only have so many hours." And it's not necessarily that each individual
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   one takes so long. It's just that there's so many, it becomes overwhelming.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:49.360]   Yep. And I think at that level, you're basically looking at the prioritization matrix. And
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.440]   we tend to do things that feel good. So we tend to do things that are easier or feel
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.760]   more urgent for us, especially when other people are asking for it. And we tend to procrastinate
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.880]   the more important tasks that may level up into a bigger outcome later. And so instead
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.000]   of basically prioritizing tasks, if you're looking at a to-do list by urgent or small...
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.840]   By the way, this is also something, right? In credit card, folks like to pay off the
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   smallest debt fastest. And this is not the rational answer. The rational answer should
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.640]   be to pay off the one with the highest interest rate.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.160]   But we look at our to-do list the same way where we're tackling smaller tasks first.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.120]   And the correct way to do it would be to prioritize by level of importance or even hardest. And
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.560]   that's because if you start something in the morning, it's a well-known idea that we are
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.640]   better in the morning. And so we basically assume you have a couple hours. Actually,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.520]   I love adding urgency to this. If you think your brain stops at 11, you have 2 hours.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.360]   Or if you start work at night, 2 hours is a really good time. What are you going to do in that time?
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   And we'll start with the important and hard tasks versus the urgent ones, which is obviously
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   incredibly difficult to do in our working world, but something we can strive for.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.000]   And are there things you've learned talking to people or doing research yourself that
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.600]   have kind of changed your perspective on this and helped you think about it differently?
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.560]   I think most people struggle with this, which is like... I think a lot of people internalize
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.360]   their struggles. And so I think the idea that other people are also struggling with this
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.440]   is helpful for folks to remember. Other things that I've learned in this... I mean,
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.800]   we basically fill... It's kind of the suitcase problem where if you have a small suitcase,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.120]   you'll fill it. If you have a large suitcase, you'll fill it. And so I think with time,
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.320]   that's kind of the other big idea is that our calendars go from X time to X time.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.040]   And so we're going to fill it with tasks. And so I would more try to think about where's your
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.320]   suitcase and how much do you get to fill. And so if you have 2 or 3 hours of good work time,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.400]   would fill that versus 8 hours and you're spreading out and probably doing the unimportant tasks.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.520]   The other thing is the calendar by default is empty, which is not true. I have a ton of
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.600]   meetings Monday through Wednesday this week, but not a lot on Thursday. It looks like I'm free.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.120]   I'm obviously not free. I'm going to catch up on all the work that I miss from taking these
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.840]   meetings. And my calendar is kind of lying to me in this way and telling me I'm free.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.760]   And so the default calendar doesn't help us. Ideally, you can hold and block time for yourself.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.560]   We know that sometimes we overschedule it when you do that. But at least having the mental model
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.000]   of this is helpful. There's a world called pre-commitment, where you think about
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.360]   what you're going to do. Actually, the more evolved thing of this is called implementation
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.600]   intentions, where you think about when, where and how you're going to do something.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.240]   And you think about that before you do it. The reality is that we're not actually that creative.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.360]   And so if I say I'm going to do this task, the task doesn't actually come to life in my mind.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.440]   It's just something in the future that's going to happen. As soon as we build it out and say when,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.200]   how and where, now it becomes something that I've thought more deeply about.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.000]   It's more real. And when we do that, it increases the likelihood that we actually do it. And this
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.800]   has been shown with flu shots. When you think about when, where and how you're going to get
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.560]   a flu shot, it's been shown with voting. When you think of when, where and how you're going to vote
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.480]   and with to-do lists. Wow.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:09.280]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.480]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.680]   and there's no one source of truth. If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   37,000, 25, 1. 37,000. That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.840]   Oracle. And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode. NetSuite is the number one cloud

[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.760]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good for you.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.560]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea. It has so many health benefits and I think
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:48.240]   one of the best and easiest ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea. Peak's Pu-Erh
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.960]   teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250 year old tea trees,
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.720]   rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins. Then everything is triple toxin screened for
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.360]   pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic mold commonly found in plants. And Peak's products are so easy
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:13.200]   and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.880]   seconds and are so travel friendly. They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.400]   between the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh which helps kickstart
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.800]   things to drink. And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.000]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more and then be happy
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.040]   that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world. But you don't
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.160]   even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US shipping, free returns
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:56.720]   and a money backed guarantee. And for a limited time you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:04.400]   with 12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak. That's P-I-Q-U-E. So check them
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.920]   out today at allthehacks.com/peak. P-I-Q-U-E. Okay. Do you need to write down the when, where,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.560]   how, or do you just need to think about it? So there was a nice study where there's, if people
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.240]   do write it down, it makes you more likely. So thinking about it is going to help. Writing it
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.200]   down is going to help more. So I would kind of build it out in your mind and write it down.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.480]   What this also does is basically, at some level, again, we procrastinate things that are complex
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.720]   and uncertain. And so it's reasonable if we have a task and we don't really know how we're going to
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.480]   start that we would procrastinate it. And so just thinking for a couple minutes on how you would
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.200]   start the task is really the win here, where you're making it less complex, less uncertain
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.280]   to do it. And it'll make you more likely to want to do it because it's going to feel easier for you.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.720]   You said tasks that are hard and complex to start. It reminded me of something I've heard
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.560]   you talk about, which kind of shocked me, which is that if you don't know a lot about something,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:09.280]   let's say I don't know a lot about investing. And so I haven't done it. My assumption, just naively,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.760]   which I now know is wrong, is that if I just learn more, that maybe I could start investing
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.160]   more frequently. And I've heard you talk about this. And I'd love to dig in a little more about
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.120]   how just teaching something to someone doesn't actually change what their underlying behavior is.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.480]   Correct. Yeah, this is another thing where if somebody says financial literacy at a party,
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.800]   I give them a 30-minute lecture. Basically, the idea here is that in a perfect world,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.560]   if I would teach you about what FICO means and how much it impacts your life from buying a home
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.480]   and whatnot, you would then take actions to improve your FICO score.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.720]   That basically, if I give you knowledge about something, how many calories are in something,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.000]   that you would then take steps to reduce the amount of calories. And this is just not what
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.160]   researchers have found. And it's really robust. It's robust in the calorie literature. And it's
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.840]   even more robust in the financial literacy literature. If I give you information about
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.960]   budgeting, this does not correlate to behavior change. I'll give you a caveat, though. So if I
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.360]   give you information about, let's say, a savings account, and then next to you is a savings teller,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.400]   and you can open a savings account, the immediate just-in-time nature of that makes it more likely
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   that you'll do it. But the effect decays every single hour to the point where after I think it
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.080]   was 24 hours, the effect is 2.1% behavior change. Which means that if I give you information about
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.960]   savings, a day or 2 later, you're 0.1% likely to actually make that behavior change. And so it's
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.800]   not zero, but it's very close to zero. And I always say we can try to invent new ways to teach
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.240]   people about finances. Maybe we haven't tried a lot. But the paper meta-analysis cover around
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.440]   200 studies of people attempting to make this connection between teaching and doing.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.600]   And so it's a really depressing stat because financial literacy in America is horrific.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.680]   If you ask people about compound interest, most people don't understand it. And so
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   the upside of financial literacy is high if we can nail it. Sadly, it hasn't panned out.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:11.440]   And I'll maybe end on an optimistic note. The upside here is that the punchline is the behavioral
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.760]   science punchline, which is the environment matters. If you make it easy for me to save,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   I'm more likely to save. If you make it more appealing for me to save, I'm more likely to save.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.560]   The idea that I know what the interest rate is a couple days before I'm about to make this decision
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.640]   just has low likelihood of changing my behavior. But if you make the steps go from 10 to 2,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   or the options go from 10 complex mutual fund options to 3, I'm more likely to do it.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.320]   Yeah. And does this apply in other aspects of life outside of money?
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.880]   For sure. Yeah. I mean, I think in a personal life, you can imagine trying to tell
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   your spouse, "Can you please clean up the dishes? Can you please pick up your clothes from the
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   floor?" You're giving them information in the form of nagging, but you're giving them information
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.760]   about the problem. And in behavioral science, we say, "Just make it easier. Make it more appealing.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:10.160]   Change the environment of the decision-making." My personal example is I also, but so does my
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.880]   spouse, tend to throw clothes on the floor. It's just easier to do that. We kind of nag at each
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   other about like, "Oh, we should pick up our clothes," et cetera. And we developed a system
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.760]   that basically is like we have a laundry basket of clean clothes. And so at some level, now we've
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:29.040]   made it easier for us to clean up our clothes. We don't actually have to change our behavior too
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.520]   much. And so we've changed the environment of decision-making to get to the outcome of a clean
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.080]   space. But we haven't actually made ourselves kind of... No amount of saying, "It's important
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.920]   that I do this," is going to make it be when I'm running out the door in the morning, "Change my
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.000]   behavior. I need to really change my environment to do that." So I think people make this mistake
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.800]   with kids. They make this mistake with family members of just telling them an information
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.160]   versus trying to actually solve the problem. If you want someone to recycle more, make the
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.320]   recycle can bigger. Make the waste can smaller. If you want someone to compost more, we want to
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.760]   make composting easier. So you can nag and nag, but it's much more painful than just changing
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.520]   the environment. Yeah. I want to go back to your laundry situation because I don't know if I quite
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.080]   followed. So you have a laundry basket of clean clothes. Yeah. And we have a laundry basket of
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.280]   dirty clothes too, but that was obvious. But sometimes you're just not going to wash everything
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.600]   as you just throw it. Maybe I have a coat or something and I just throw it on the ground.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:30.080]   And so all my goal now is to aim. I just need to aim into the basket. And now our room looks
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.040]   much cleaner than having 2 or 3 things on the floor all the time. This is a place to throw
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.520]   all the clothes that are not ready to be washed because maybe you just wore a sweatshirt for an
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.560]   hour and you want to hang it up in the closet. But you know that's not going to happen right now
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.120]   because you know your personality. Right. Yeah. And it's also something where like,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.040]   "Yeah, I hang a lot of my clothes up." But the margin of error that we have
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.600]   is going to be high over time. So yes, I can put away... If you have a dirty dish,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   in order for you not to ever have dishes out, you'd have to have a perfect record.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.280]   The reality is once in a while, you're going to leave a dish out. Everyone makes some errors.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.040]   Everyone is messy once in a while. And so systems should try to solve for those errors instead of
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.600]   solving for perfection and then getting mad when 1 or 2 errors happen. I think that's particularly
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.840]   interesting in a household thing where... For folks I live with, I have a communal
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.400]   living environment where there's apartments and there's a house and there's a communal kitchen.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.600]   So there's lots of humans to make errors. So what kinds of systems do you have?
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.920]   Yeah. We have something called Sink Zero, which is lovely because basically it means
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:43.360]   "No dishes in the sink ever." It's a nice rule of thumb. It's basically like saying "No carbs."
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.600]   Saying "No carbs" is easier than saying "I'm going to once in a while have or try to limit my carbs."
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.360]   By saying "No dishes in the sink ever," it's a very clear understanding of what to do in
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.680]   which context. By the way, this is also helpful for spending money. You don't want to say,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.960]   "I'm going to spend less on something. I'm going to spend less on restaurants."
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.480]   The idea would be you make a rule of thumb that says, "I don't go out to eat on the weekday."
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:10.880]   Or "I only go out to eat once a weekend." In that case, you know exactly what is correct.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.600]   You've either followed the rule or you haven't followed the rule.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.840]   When you say, "I'm going to spend less," it's very difficult to know if you've adhered to the rule.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.200]   And if you say, "Oh, don't leave your dishes in the sink," that kind of implies that maybe one
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   time you can leave your dishes in the sink if you're off to the races. We even have a thing
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.720]   where you should bring it back to your room instead of leaving it in the sink.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.520]   We give people the fail state of saying, "We know you're in a hurry. Just bring it to your room."
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.640]   So that would be one. I think we do a lot of, again, this idea that there's errors that people
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.080]   make. And so if you see something out, you don't get passive aggressive like, "Oh my gosh, I'm
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.000]   cleaning up somebody else's stuff." You just clean it up because you've also made an error.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   So you have a mentality that we're all in this together. And at one point,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.960]   I'll leave something out. So let's help each other. By the way, cooking is very interesting.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.760]   Right now, we've hired a chef. It's cheaper than if we all buy food and then we all have to divide
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.080]   and conquer. There's lots of food waste. And so I think there's lovely ways people should look
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.120]   into making life much, much easier for themselves. Meal delivery is something most people should do.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.280]   It's actually one of the best ways to lose weight as well. Time and time again, studies try to help
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.840]   people lose weight and it's very difficult. But if you make it easy, like shipping yourself a meal
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.640]   every day, more people succeed. Yeah. And there are a ton of
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.960]   startups that have raised money from venture capitalists and offer crazy deals.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.240]   So you could probably prearrange your meals from one company for a week or 2 and then switch and
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.880]   switch and switch and probably take advantage of promo codes. It would probably get you through
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:46.000]   at least a quarter of meals, which I may or may not have done in the past. Yes.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.560]   So yeah. So on that note about being healthy or losing weight, there's the food side and
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   the exercise side. Are there lessons that kind of tie from behavioral psychology about
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.800]   committing to more exercise, something that I think many people struggle with? And it always
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.560]   feels like you mentioned habits. Habits aren't always the way and something with as high a
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.320]   commitment level of putting on a pair of shorts and shoes and going out for 45 minutes is maybe
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.600]   not something you could build a habit around. Are there tricks or lessons that can help here?
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.520]   Yeah, that's the same thing. Exercise is very difficult to form a habit.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:29.040]   One latest study I saw says it took six months. And as soon as you have a habit, it does become
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.240]   easier because you need less intention to do it. But when you don't have a habit,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:37.760]   you actually need to form an intention to do a behavior. And so one idea is that you're actually
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.600]   forming the habit based on the getting ready. So, you know, putting your shoes out, etc. That's the
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.960]   habit that you're trying to establish versus the habit of exercise that actually has been shown to
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.360]   drive some higher adherence. The other one is just past behavior predicts future behavior. And so
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.640]   the best predictor of forming a habit is actually doing it. It's not a cheat sheet. It's just real.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.240]   And so, you know, I think at some level, people, if they commit to routines and consistency,
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.440]   this is fine. And if you miss a day, that's OK, too. And then, you know, I'm a big fangirl of
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:18.080]   Peloton. I think Peloton makes it more fun to do workouts. They have these instructors that are
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.600]   quite compelling. I talked to the product manager at Peloton and he said, "Look, we have these
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.120]   challenges that start every month. And so there's this idea of fresh start where you can basically
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.440]   say, 'Today, I'm a different person.'" Peloton actually helps you do that all the time, right?
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:36.320]   You can say, "Today, I'm going to join on Dolly Parton Day." We need to give ourselves an excuse
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   to start something. And so fresh start, doing it on Mondays or the first day of the month can be
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:46.400]   one. Or joining a challenge for a short period of time is one. But increasing our motivation in
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.360]   order to get over the friction is definitely going to help kind of fuel the exercise fire.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.320]   And then, you know, I think there's some level of variety and consistency. I think people kind
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.280]   of stick to the same workout. And I would encourage folks to try something different,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.440]   if not just to appreciate the main workout that you do. But we can tire quickly from
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:11.200]   doing the same thing every day. Yeah. As soon as I'm done with my broken foot,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:18.240]   I intend to go for the fresh start. So when you think about longer term goals,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.280]   things that you want to change over the year, change over the next couple of years, how do
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.160]   you think you can effectively do that? Are you a fan of New Year's resolutions? Are you a fan of
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:34.000]   things like that? Yeah. I think people give New Year's resolutions a lot of... They kind of get
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.520]   made fun of. And at some level, it's a really nice excuse to think about what you want to
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.040]   do and who you want to be and create that, I said before, implementation intention for your goals.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.200]   I think goals by themselves are pretty useless. We need the plan. We need to connect it to action.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.240]   We need to tell somebody. So I think, yeah, the idea of just saying I'm going to do this is not
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.360]   going to change your behavior. I think what can is creating the plan and redesigning your
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.400]   environment to support that. One big opportunity for change is when we have change in our life.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:07.360]   So habits, back to habits, habits are very, very difficult because you're trying to do something
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.160]   new in a world where you're very used to doing the same thing every day. So Wendy Wood has
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.200]   researched this. It's like 43% of our behaviors every day are habitual. We're just not thinking
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.000]   about it. This is driving and the coffee and the brushing the teeth. And so at some level,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.520]   introducing something new, it's reasonable to say, my gosh, that's going to be difficult because I'm
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.400]   so used to doing the things I normally do. And so really, there's an interesting opportunity
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.800]   when you disrupt your environment. So when you change jobs, when you move, when you have a child,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.280]   maybe when you're traveling, this is when your environment changes and your habits are disrupted.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.760]   The theory here is called habit discontinuity theory, by which you're basically breaking
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   something. And this is the golden moment to be able to add something new. There's a nice study,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.880]   kind of a classic one that was done in the London tube system by which they shut it down for a
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.760]   couple of days. And people are really habitual creatures when it comes to commute. And so people
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.360]   then had to find another route to work when their station was shut down. And 5% of people found
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.560]   more optimal routes. This is interesting because if you're so... Commute is all about optimization
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.440]   and efficiency. And why didn't these people think of that beforehand? What were they doing walking
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.960]   a longer way to a different station that was longer for them? It took some disruption for
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.600]   them to seek out an alternative and then they were able to stick with it. And so when we disrupt our
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.880]   normal routines is when we can start kind of looking around and saying, "Is there something
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.800]   optimal to do?" So I think if I could, I'd get everyone to move more. We should be moving
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.280]   apartments more. We should be moving jobs more. We should be changing our environment much more.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.440]   Those are all kind of big disruptions. I heard you mention if you have a kid,
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.920]   I can imagine if you were like, "Gosh, I really want to start eating healthy. I need to disrupt
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:56.320]   my life." Maybe having a child is a big step. Are there ways to kind of manufacture disruption
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:02.400]   in your life? Yeah. I mean, I think... So add a new one, get new friends, which is probably not
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.240]   as hard as a kid. But we are who we surround ourselves with. And so one way to change your
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.640]   environment is maybe is not... If it's not physically, is to surround yourself with different
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.520]   people. So I think kind of an easier way to do it, maybe to expose yourself to different people.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.680]   This could be joining a running group. This could be going to different lectures by which your
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.280]   mental, your cognitive environment then is changing and the influences on your environment
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.760]   are also changing. So that would be a bigger swing. And then the other one, I just had a friend who
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.520]   hired a kind of a minimalist coach to come over and help them redesign their apartment.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.840]   Sometimes it's hard for us to understand our own environment. And so I think, again,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.520]   bringing other people in to say like, "Help me redesign my kitchen so that I'm more likely to
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.200]   eat better." This is changing where the chips go. This is changing where the veggies go in the
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.480]   fridge. By the way, I think Instapots are lovely. Cooking is very hard. It's not ideal. It takes
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.880]   work. And so if we can make it fundamentally easier, we should do that. And you may not have
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   the intuition on changing your environment as much as somebody else does. Sometimes the smallest
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:12.720]   changes make the biggest impact. And Trade Coffee is a great addition to your new year routine.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.120]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today. Trade is a subscription service we've been

[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:22.240]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your cooking
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.680]   at home? If not, definitely go back and give it a listen. But one of his top hacks was using the
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.440]   microwave more. I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.480]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:44.400]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.520]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:56.480]   the process so much. The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.160]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too. And if you need a
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.960]   recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly recommend David Chang's
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:13.280]   Salmon Rice. It is so good. And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.520]   launched last year, you have to check it out. So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.600]   So one thing I noticed, we changed our daughter's room around this weekend.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.800]   Totally changed. Basically moved every piece of furniture and it now feels like a different room.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   I'm wondering if that's enough. Could rearranging your living room or your bedroom be enough of a
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:08.160]   disruption to really jumpstart a new habit? Or not habit, but a new change?
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.680]   I think it's worth trying. I think these things are 100% worth trying. The idea that these things
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.440]   are... It's just reversible too. If you change it, you can always change it back. Yeah, I think
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.320]   probably changing furniture around. If you're a female, getting a haircut could change how you...
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.200]   I once had a little pink strip in my hair and people... They actually talk to me more. Baristas
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   and restaurant folks would engage more. I don't know if it felt more friendly or open, but it
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.080]   changed my environment by nature of how people related to me. So I think all these small changes
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:42.880]   are good. Look, the idea that we've landed on the optimal way to live and be is just silly.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.560]   We've accidentally chose many things in our life. We've accidentally opted into the life that we're
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.760]   living. Many of that has been by choice and by design. But it's hard to imagine that there
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.720]   wouldn't be small ways that we could change it to improve it. And just by changing it,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.520]   actually, we could likely improve it because of the nature of change.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:07.440]   So when you brought up the commuting example, if you had asked me, "Oh, what are ways that
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.800]   you could have a more optimal day?" I might never have thought of that. Is there a process or even
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.200]   just a list of things that people could take inventory of that would allow you to discover
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.800]   ways that you could maybe be more optimal or intentional that wouldn't come to mind if you
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.000]   just thought about it? That's a great question. So I'll kind of go with the obvious, but it's
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   going to be a harder one for people to optimize immediately. One thing that makes us most happy
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.640]   is people. We tend to spend money on things. If you're buying a home, you look at the countertops
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.840]   and how well the bathrooms are done, not will you like your neighbors? And so why do I live with all
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.560]   these people? It's because I've optimized my life for happiness. If we think happiness is about
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.120]   relationships, which most studies show that it is, then you want to design your life to make
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:02.480]   relationships easier. And so I think one thing that people could do in general to optimize their
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.200]   life is to make relationships easier. I'll give a tactical example here is that the weekend's
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.800]   lovely because it's a coordinated event. So we have two days where we can all socially hang out
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.640]   and people are actually happier on the weekend. Even unemployed people are happier on the weekend.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   So it's not about work. It's just about the idea of coordinating with other people. And so I think
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.600]   we can use a calendar in a way here to coordinate with other people. Such that you could say every
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.680]   Saturday, you're going to schedule a brunch at 11am on Dolores Park where people just bring bagels
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.240]   and your friends know to show up. It's difficult to always coordinate plans with people. And maybe
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.320]   sometimes some friends won't show up, but maybe sometimes a few will. And so you have a core group
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.280]   of people who just know 11am brunch on Saturday. This takes away the annoyingness of back and forth
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.640]   calendaring that prevents us from doing something. And you can imagine doing this for Zoom workouts
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:57.120]   at 8am on one day. You could imagine doing it for game nights once a month, the first Friday
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.280]   of the month or something with your friends. The goal here is just to make things that make us
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.480]   happier, easier. And if we believe that relationships make us happy, then we want to
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.760]   make that easier for us to actually do. So hacking the calendar is one way to do it with social
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.480]   coordination. Are there any other non-obvious things that you think make people generally
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.120]   happier that we don't think about? Yeah. I actually think complimenting people is...
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:27.280]   Chris, you're looking very good today. The smile is great. Your look with the black shirt.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.280]   Very professional. So I said this is an example, but it actually turns out that fake compliments,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.480]   people also feel very good at as well. And so I think we can basically help people feel
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.600]   better if we're complimenting them and also we're getting compliments. Very, very easy
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:50.000]   to create affinity that way. And that goes in the giving research where if I already give you $20,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.240]   you're happier if you spend it on somebody else. And if you spend it on yourself...
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.640]   No, obviously, it's probably that money goes up to lots of money. You can say we can argue
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.400]   if I give you a million dollars and you give it away, are you happy? But in small dollar amounts
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:10.240]   like this, we can actually be much happier by giving stuff away. And the very easy thing you
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.800]   can do right now is probably just compliment somebody. A genuine compliment is better.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.560]   But even if it's not, it's probably helpful. One thing I know I've talked to you in the past
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.880]   about the work you do with companies. And I know you have a process for how you
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.880]   take a company's product and try to break down ways that it could be improved. And one of those
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:39.040]   steps is, I believe, a behavioral diagnostic. Is that... Am I close? Yeah. Yeah. Nailed it. Softball
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:45.600]   for me here. Can you apply that same methodology? And maybe feel free to talk about that process.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:52.880]   But I'm curious after whether you could apply that to your own day and do a diagnostic of your
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:59.280]   average day. Love it. Yeah. So basically, a behavioral diagnosis is a map, this visual
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.800]   map of every single step and decision that you make in order to get to the behavior that you're
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:15.520]   aiming for. So if I want to, say, save money once a month, $10, making this up as a bank,
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.480]   I would do a behavioral diagnosis that says, "I need to log in. I need to remember my password.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.280]   Oh, shoot. I forgot my password. I have to remember my password or go to my email."
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.960]   And I go through all the steps that somebody has to do and the decisions in order to get to this
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.560]   key behavior. And when we walk through this with companies, there's so many light bulbs of just
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.320]   people realizing how much work people have to do. And this is logistical friction, actual steps.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.600]   But most of it is cognitive friction of things that people have to decide and think about before
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.760]   they can actually succeed in the behavior that you're aiming to change. So the first step in
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.440]   that is actually figuring out the behavior that you want to change, which is definitely a personal
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.800]   opportunity. And we call it, at Irrational Labs, getting uncomfortably specific. So instead of
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.960]   saying, "I want to save money," or "I want to eat healthy," it's like, "I want to eat a salad
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.400]   every day for lunch for a week." Now we've been obnoxiously uncomfortably specific about the
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.760]   behavior such that the hack or the intervention is just going to be easier than saying, "I want
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.320]   to eat healthier." And so for ourselves, I think we need to get more specific about the behavior.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   It's not going to help us if we say, "I want to eat healthier. I want to be financially better
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.720]   off." Or, "I want to be happier." We need to get to that behavior. And at that point, then you can
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.120]   do this diagnostic where you're like, "Let me do a map of every single step that it would take to
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.640]   get to that." If you're trying to date right now and you want to say, "I want to go on a date
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:42.000]   a week," what are all the steps that it would take for you to do that? You'd have to be swiping
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.240]   maybe every morning. You'd have to be responding to messages in the evening. You'd have to keep
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.600]   one night open. Many people are very busy and you have one night open. So at some level, walking
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.520]   through all those steps, you can then see like, "Wow, this is actually harder than I thought. Let
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.680]   me try to call it the 3B model where we're either going to reduce barriers or increase benefits."
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:06.320]   So once we've picked a behavior, it's 3B. So the behavior, the barriers and the benefits,
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.040]   you pick a behavior, you decrease the barriers and you increase the benefits to doing that.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.520]   So we make it easier and we make it highly motivating. Barriers and benefits. And so
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.760]   the diagnostic then you look at this and you say, "Let me just make it easy. Let me decrease the
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:24.000]   barriers to doing something and I'll be more likely to do it or I add some fun benefits."
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:31.040]   Yeah. So I think we're fortunate that people like yourselves take all of your skills helping
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.560]   companies do this, mostly, at least as far as I can tell, for good. Working with companies to
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:41.600]   help people save more, working with that kind of thing. There are plenty of companies out there
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.040]   that I think have learned these same tactics and use them to get you to scroll endlessly on TikTok
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:53.200]   or various other habits that are very beneficial to companies, but maybe not beneficial to your
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:50:02.400]   life. Are there tips you have for people who are trying to avoid getting sucked into companies who
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.480]   have learned all the same tricks, but maybe are applying them to ways that are less optimal for
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:12.800]   their lives? Yeah. So first, I think realizing you're walking into a really hard environment.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.480]   If you go to a mall, how could you not spend money? People have thought
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.720]   deeply about how to get you to spend money. They've thought deeply about
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.880]   getting you to buy something that is aspirationally good for you, but may not
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.520]   increase your happiness. And so it's a really hard fight that we have. And it's getting harder.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.760]   Like Amazon Prime making it... We said one of the ways to get us to do something is to make it
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:40.080]   easier. Online now, Amazon Prime is the goldmine of that. And we have now Amazon Go stores where
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.680]   you just walk out, right? They figured something out about human behavior. And it's going to be
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:50.080]   hard for us to fight that. I think at some level, the macro solution is disappointing for people is
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.160]   where we actually need companies to design better environments. And that's what we try to help
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.280]   companies do is design better environments to help us succeed because it's so difficult for
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.960]   ourselves to fight these forces. And maybe the uplifting thing is we can.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.400]   So from a focus perspective, there's plenty of apps out there that can help you focus more.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.360]   There's RescueTime that gives you data, which data usually isn't enough.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.560]   There's a new app that I just used that if you go to anything other than the screen you're on,
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:25.040]   a voice will come on and keep talking to you until you go back to your screen.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.840]   These are these self-controlled basic devices where you have to have a one-time motivation
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.640]   to put them on yourself. And it's tough. And so I think that's the upside. In a hot state,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.840]   we're not going to stop eating the chips. We're not going to stop Netflix on show one when you
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.920]   want to binge on show two and three. We can't rely on ourselves to make those decisions in
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.160]   the heat of the moment. We need to make these implementation intentions before
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:53.680]   or put self-control devices up. This is difficult. So typically around 30% of people,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.920]   the research is like, "Are you a sophisticated, somebody who understands that in the future,
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.640]   you will fail? Or are you a naivete, somebody who has more optimism and thinks in the future,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.720]   you may succeed despite all the forces?" And sophisticates are a little bit,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.640]   are much better at putting on these self-control devices to ourselves.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.360]   So asking, when you go up to the counter, nobody's preventing you from asking McDonald's to say,
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.200]   "Can I have half the fries?" "I want some fries. Can I have half?"
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.640]   This is something that we could all do. And it's difficult. And so that's one of the reasons why
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.080]   you just don't ask for the fries in the first place is because you know you're going to eat
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.600]   them all. But yeah, I would encourage folks to think about the behavior you want to change.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.480]   And then the apps or tools that can help you do it in a cold state, not in a hot one.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:44.560]   Yeah. And does just discovering the biases that we have help? I know that it seems like
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:49.280]   from some of our conversation that just learning about how your brain works and how you might
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.480]   think about things doesn't really help. But I know that I've been to a handful of unconscious
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.920]   bias trainings that now I'm wondering, are those even effective at changing anyone's behavior?
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:07.680]   Yeah. So the research does not look promising for unconscious bias trainings. I'm sure that
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.040]   they're improving, that new companies are coming out and trying to improve them. So I would say,
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.920]   you know, I may be wrong in the latest company, but most research to date does not look promising
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.280]   for basically teaching you about your bias, actually changing your behavior. Which is why,
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:29.360]   if you're thinking from a hiring standpoint, you want to blind the resumes so that you're
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:34.080]   not seeing names and you're not seeing pictures. You don't want to look at the school that people
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.480]   came from right away, because this may influence you. Actually turning your video off is good in
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.960]   the first interview, so you're not biased by looks. And so these are the types of things
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.760]   that will actually help us make better and more equitable decision making. Teaching us
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.480]   about our biases so that in the future we can become better people is not likely to work.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   Okay. So future is not necessarily promising for learning, but I like that you've taught us a ton
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.600]   of different processes and things we can put into place to kind of plan for what we know we are not
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.680]   good at. Are there any other parting hacks for life, money, travel, anything that you want to
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   share that we haven't gotten to hear? Yes. Okay, I have a couple. One is the hedonic
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:21.040]   treadmill is real, which means like once you have something, you adapt to it and you want more
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:28.160]   of it. So this is especially relevant if you are potentially surrounded by other people who
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.120]   have the thing. And I think this makes me very nervous because if you go and you buy a four
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.760]   bedroom house, your next house is not going to be a three bedroom house. You've made a decision
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.960]   to lock yourself into something that's going to be hard to downgrade. So I would be very,
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:49.040]   very cautious of making decisions that try to upgrade your lifestyle too quickly because you're
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.440]   cognitively going to be locked in and you adapt to things so much that it's not, you know, if I
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.680]   have nice countertops or not, does not change my happiness levels or my life satisfaction.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.560]   And yet if you have lovely countertops in their next house, you have bad ones. This is going to
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.760]   be difficult for you. I don't wear jewelry, zero, no earrings, no necklace, no rings, nothing.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:13.120]   There's some level of like, if I wanted, if I started wearing a necklace or earrings, I would
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:18.080]   just want better ones. I'd be on the treadmill. And so I've decided for jewelry to get off the
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.560]   treadmill, to not just not participate. And I think that actually is very nice to pick a few
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.160]   categories in life where you're just not going to be on the treadmill. You're not going to
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.560]   participate. I think this could be, you know, if you're not a foodie, you know, do you really need
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.120]   to go out to the very nice restaurants? Some foodies, I get it. You want to, but you can
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.760]   choose to opt out of some of these categories, the jewelry that, you know, for women, it's clothes
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.520]   and shoes. It could be makeup. You can say, this is just not something I'm going to compete in or
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.840]   want to aspire to. And once you do, it's going to again, be harder to get off. And then the other
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:56.480]   one for travel is around memory. And a lot of kind of happiness comes, there's kind of a debate in
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:02.160]   the literature. Is it, am I happy because of the moment I'm happy or am I happy when I remember
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:08.480]   something in the past? And when we think about memory, we want to create a lot of peak experiences.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   And so if I were designing a vacation, I probably wouldn't have you go on a vacation for two weeks
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.800]   somewhere. I'd probably have you go either multiple vacations of three-day weekends,
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.200]   where you're creating lots of small experiences for yourself that are memorable and exciting.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.240]   You have something to look forward to every weekend. You have something to reflect on when
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.400]   you come back versus kind of a two-week vacation in the middle of the year. Or within that two-week
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.680]   vacation, have multiple peak points where you're going in different places to create memories.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.320]   And that's something we can do in our daily lives as well, where just kind of making sure that
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:46.160]   one month doesn't blend to the next and creating more peak experiences and memories for us.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.400]   A group of friends and I went to Valencia Street in San Francisco that closed off the streets on
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.760]   Fridays. And we set up a table and had a fancy dinner in the middle of the street.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:01.520]   Okay, we had tacos, but we all dressed up. We put those lamps and a generator and classical music.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.760]   This is weird. We're not going to do it every weekend. But by doing these kind of weird,
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.640]   crazy things once in a while, we can create kind of meaningful experiences. These are nice things
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:15.040]   to talk about. It's a high memory. It's not going to be like every Friday night that we have.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.200]   And so we should probably put more work into creating these kind of peak experiences versus
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.440]   having normal Friday nights. Yeah. Any other favorite
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.400]   peak experiences that like I want to hear your list?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:31.920]   I do this no small talk card thing. So in general, I think conversation tends to go to the lowest
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.480]   common denominator, where if you're in a room with people, it doesn't benefit you to go up to
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:41.520]   somebody and say, what is your deepest fear? This is awkward. You put yourself at risk. I don't
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:47.120]   recommend it. And it's not good for anyone if you're just talking about mundane or the weather
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.080]   or sports. You're just not going to enjoy yourself that much. So this is a problem. And so how do you
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.000]   overcome this problem? And this kind of goes back to the weekend question of coordination.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.280]   If everybody agrees that you're going to talk about your deepest fear, then it's not weird
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.120]   for you to go up to somebody and ask them. It'd be weird for you to talk about small talk.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.240]   If everybody has agreed that you're going to be talking about more vulnerable
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.960]   or interesting things that evening. And so one thing to do if you have a group of friends
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.320]   you're hosting over or in general, kind of a host of something is to mandate that people talk about
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.920]   interesting things. And I have these no small talk cards that are kind of decision aids in this. So
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.320]   I just say don't talk about small talk things. People get nervous. And what should I talk about?
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.680]   And so actually, we did an experiment here. And people really don't like it if you just say don't
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:35.040]   talk small talk. It's hard to think of these things. As soon as we give the cards to people,
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.200]   it becomes much easier and people enjoy it. They make more connections. They want to hang
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:44.160]   out with each other for longer. And they're talking about a bigger variety of topics.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:50.000]   And so I would give your party members some decision aids or some help if you go this route.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.480]   And by the way, we are happier when we talk about these vulnerable things. We like each other more.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:01.040]   So what are your biggest fears? Any other good topics for someone that wants to put this into
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:06.240]   place for friends coming over in the next few days? Yeah. I think we did an experiment where
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.120]   we talked about what is the best question. And so we had 2 conditions where it was like talk
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:17.840]   about the past was a few parties or talk about the future was a few other parties. So 2 conditions.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.120]   What do you think was better at predicting vulnerability?
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.480]   The past. That's what we thought, too. And it turns out there was no difference.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:31.920]   So both conditions beat out the control. The control was just kind of an activity,
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.160]   a random activity that didn't push conversation. So the upside here is that talking about anything
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:41.760]   interesting is going to be helpful. But you can think about getting people to pontificate about
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.160]   their future self, either their hopes or dreams or their past. When was the last time that you've
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.880]   been in love? Are you more like your father or your mother? Or one of my favorite is what do
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.680]   you want to be complimented on more? This actually helps reveal a lot about somebody.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.440]   It says, you know what, I'm not complimented on this. And I personally think that it's a strength
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.680]   of mine that may go unseen. It also gives you an end to compliment them on that. So...
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.160]   Which we know creates happiness, even if it's even if it's fake.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.880]   Yeah. Awesome. This was fantastic. I want to hear a little about what you're working on
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:18.240]   and about this podcast that came out yesterday. Wonderful. Yeah. So I'll start there. The podcast
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.160]   is called The Science of Change. And the idea here is that we interview visionary thought leaders
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.080]   from companies that are trying to change our behavior. So we talked to Peloton to figure out
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.560]   how they designed an addicting exercise program and Duolingo to figure out how they get us to
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.280]   learn a language and Credit Karma to figure out how they get us out of debt. And behavioral science
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.840]   is really about the environment that we live in. And so we're trying to deep dive with the people
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.080]   who are actually designing our environment and all the apps and products and services we use.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:52.000]   So I'm very excited about The Science of Change. And it is out with the Peloton episode being our
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.160]   first. And then Irrational Labs. So folks are interested in behavior change, behavioral science.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:04.320]   Irrational Labs is a behavior change company co-founded by myself and Dan Ariely. We have
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.800]   boot camps, we have trainings, and we do a lot of consulting with companies to help design
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.440]   new products and features that change behavior for good. And if you go to our website,
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.800]   the pro tip is to subscribe to the newsletter. And we send out what I think are fairly interesting
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.920]   summaries of our latest research and what's going on in the field.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.120]   Awesome. Well, you're already in the podcast app listening to this. So definitely check out
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.560]   The Science of Change. And Kristen, thank you so much for being here.

[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.120]   Does anyone else just want to get dressed up and host a fancy taco party in the middle of
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.040]   a street downtown? Or is that just me? That was fantastic. And if you're here for the first time,

[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.200]   from me yet, I promise I'm working on something I really think you'll enjoy. And once it's going
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.600]   again, it should be on a much more regular schedule. All right. That's it for this time.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.760]   You can always reach me at Chris@allthehacks.com. See you next week.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:38.800]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.640]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.920]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational wealth and
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.800]   spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.440]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world can build
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.800]   wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining. I know because
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:08.640]   I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened to an episode where Andrew
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind. And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.880]   millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement plan. And that's just
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.000]   one of the many fascinating stats he shared. The Personal Finance Podcast has something for
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.320]   everyone. It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.880]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out. Just search for
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.160]   the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts and
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:38.800]   enjoy.
