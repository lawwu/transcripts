[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.720]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.960]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and not only am I excited to have you on my
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920]   journey to find all the hacks, but I am really excited to have you here for
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.480]   today's interview, because I get to talk to Kristen Berman, who is a top
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   researcher in the field of behavioral economics.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   She co-founded Irrational Labs with famed professor Dan Ariely, where they've
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.160]   worked to bring behavioral science to life inside of hundreds of big and small
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.720]   companies.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.120]   She also co-founded Common Sense Lab at Duke University.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.360]   She was a founding team member at Google's Behavioral Science Unit, and she
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.720]   co-authored a series of workbooks called Hacking Human Nature for Good, A Practical
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.120]   Guide to Changing Behavior.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   Finally, she just launched a new podcast called The Science of Change, where she
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160]   talks with the leaders at major companies like Peloton and Credit Karma who are
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   actually changing human behavior today.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.480]   In our conversation, we discuss what research shows about why people act so
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.640]   irrationally, how we can actually start to change our own behaviors, why she
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.280]   thinks habits are overrated, and hear some of her favorite hacks for increasing
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.960]   happiness, whether it's during vacation or at your next dinner party.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.440]   So I hope you enjoy this conversation with Kristen Berman.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.160]   Kristen, thanks for being here.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.200]   I'm very excited to be here.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.280]   So I have heard you speak a few different times, and I think it's so fascinating
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.200]   how people are completely irrational in many cases, even though a lot of what
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280]   we've talked about on our show is about doing things the rational way because it
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.040]   makes sense and you can earn more and save more, but you come with a totally
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.720]   different angle.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.520]   So I'd love you to give some background on yourself and how you got into all of
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.840]   this.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.240]   Wonderful.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.200]   Yeah, so I'm a behavioral scientist, which basically means I study decision
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.160]   making, but more than that, study basically the mistakes that people make in
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.960]   their decisions.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.760]   And we tend to make a lot of mistakes.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.840]   And these are for small decisions, they're for big decisions.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.440]   And the reality is, even if you know about these mistakes, it's very hard to
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.200]   avoid them.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.880]   So I may know that social norms influence my behavior, but if everybody else has
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.000]   bought this, you know, one purse or this computer, I may still be influenced to
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.600]   buy it, despite the fact that knowing that I don't want to be influenced by
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.320]   other people.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.840]   So knowing about these biases and these psychologies aren't as helpful as we
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.800]   think to change our behavior.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.520]   And so in behavioral science, the question would be is what is?
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.920]   And that's basically what we study.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   And the punchline tends to be that the environment of decision making is
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.240]   basically the goldmine here.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   So I may like M&Ms, but if the M&Ms are close to me, I'll eat more of them.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.200]   And if the M&Ms are farther from me with a lid on, I'll eat less.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.440]   So my attitude, preference and belief for something, these M&Ms in this example,
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.880]   matters much less than the environment that they're in.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.440]   And when we understand that, it's very fun because you can basically change your
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   environment.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.840]   You can say, how do I change my environment to change my behavior?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.560]   And with that comes a whole new toolkit of what you can do to improve your life.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360]   Is it as simple as just changing your environment and boom, that's easy.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.640]   I now am saving more, eating healthier and exercising.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.080]   You know, nothing is simple.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.040]   I think the difference is basically when you're doing it for yourself, you have to
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   make a one-time decision to change your environment.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.200]   So at some level, your motivation has to be high enough to not buy the chips when
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.280]   you're in the grocery store.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.000]   And that is going to be easier than buying the chips and trying not to eat them
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.560]   every day.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   And so it still takes work, but the work is just different.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.680]   It comes at one point versus, you know, spread out over daily decision making.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680]   Obviously, it's easier if a company does it for us.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.200]   If Facebook would just limit the amount of time that we could spend on it, it'd be
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.160]   easier than us trying to set alerts and notifications that say, "Your screen time
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   is four hours today."
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.080]   And then you have to make a decision about tomorrow.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.560]   It's better if they do it for us.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.400]   But it's possible we can do it for ourselves.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.920]   And that's the upside here.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.120]   Are there some examples of things that people often do wrong and ways that they
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.040]   could start to improve them to make life more intentional?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   Yeah, I mean, just talking about finances is interesting.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.280]   I think if people spent a weekend setting up their account structure in a better way
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.480]   that they would make better financial decisions.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.160]   You know, we tend to think that we can spend less, save more, and make this as a
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.600]   daily or monthly decision.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.080]   And a better way to do this is an account structure that automatically saves every
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   month into an investment account or automatically saves into your goal account
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   and potentially creating more rules of thumb for yourself by which you're not
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.680]   using your credit card for small expenses.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320]   Although I know that for points people, that's probably a sin.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.640]   But for many people, you should not use your credit card for small expenses.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.560]   And so there are different ways to do this and especially for finances.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.480]   But it does take some upfront motivation to do this.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.600]   And same with eating.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.920]   You know, we can design our kitchen in better ways.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.680]   I think many times people put the fruits and veggies in the fruit and veggie
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.720]   drawer, which is, you know, it's hard to see them when they go bad.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.240]   And you put this soda on the top shelf and it's very easy to see the soda.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.600]   And so at some level, if you design your fridge so that it's impossible to miss
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   the blueberries that are going bad, more people will eat the blueberries.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.200]   And so we want to think very deeply about our environment and especially the daily
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   environment that we live in to do this.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.520]   Yeah, you mentioned some rules of thumb.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.280]   I'm curious if there are specific rules of thumb.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.120]   Let's start with savings that adopting day to day could change your behavior more
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.360]   easily than just wanting to change it, which it sounds like is impossible.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.880]   Yeah, I actually, well, one thing that annoys me is when people say savings is a
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.680]   habit, like I'm going to create a savings habit.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.360]   It's like savings is not a habit.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.160]   You have to go in there into your account.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160]   You have to log in, by the way.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.200]   You have to remember your password.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.480]   Most people don't remember their password.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.080]   Then you have to choose how much you want to save and transfer it over.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.200]   And you have to do this on a regular basis.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.640]   And so things like that are just not habits.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.360]   Habits is when you wake up and you drink water or you brush your teeth or you're
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.120]   getting coffee.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.640]   That's more of a habit.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.120]   Doing a complex behavior at random intervals during the month is not a habit.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.440]   And it's very hard to form at that level.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.320]   In fact, one time they just removed reminders and people stopped saving
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.960]   completely.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.840]   And so the move for savings is actually just to set up the reoccurring transfer at
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.920]   the time that you get paid.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.600]   And that's critical for most people is to set up at the point you get paid.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.760]   However, banks, terrible.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.520]   They don't do this.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.480]   There are companies now trying to do this.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.120]   Chime, I think, has it timed with your deposits.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.000]   I believe Digit has it timed with your deposits at some level.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.560]   And so I think the rule of thumb for savings is about reoccurring transfers
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.800]   timed with your deposits.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.000]   And we tend to measure in behavioral science process versus outcome.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.520]   So just doing this is the win.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.000]   You get the win if you do this.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   The amount you save now is a different decision, but I'd say most people should
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.680]   be setting up the process to get you to build the nest egg and worrying less
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.400]   about getting the absolute right number.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.720]   In fact, I think one mistake people make is trying to get the absolute right
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   number, and this prevents them from doing anything.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.120]   And in behavioral science, basically, when there's complexity, we procrastinate.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.240]   And so when you don't save, this is worse than saving the wrong number.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And I've always told people that are struggling to start saving that you could
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   start with a really low number.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   And if it works, you could just raise the number.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.720]   Totally.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.800]   Or maybe in some future world, we could have a product that would just like
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.480]   automatically raise the number every so often.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.920]   And you'd have to choose to stop raising the number because as I think I've heard
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.160]   you say many times, people are more likely to opt in than opt out.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.440]   Yeah, well, we're more likely to basically take the default.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.560]   So if the default is basically not saving, we're more likely to not save.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.960]   And if the default is to save, we're more likely to save.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.800]   And if it rounds up to a bigger number, if it adds a dollar every week, we're more
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.840]   likely to do this if it's the default.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.480]   But by the way, the other thing, your idea here on getting people to start small is
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.000]   very nice.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.520]   There was a nice study by Hal Hirschfeld who basically looked at opt-in rates when
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   saving was either a low number, you could imagine a dollar a week or $4 a month, or
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.400]   you can imagine $10 a week or $40 a month, and then annualize that.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.760]   And people opted in when it was in the lower frame.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.640]   So like a per day or per week amount at a higher rate than if it was annualized or
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.160]   monthly.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.680]   And so basically, that's kind of like a reduced cognitive overload.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.000]   You know, it's only we can all afford $2 or something.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.720]   We can all afford $3.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.760]   And understanding that gets people more likely to say yes to something.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.120]   And it's so obvious, right?
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.360]   But banks and stuff, we don't think this way.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.720]   We think about annual or monthly.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.920]   And how does this change as people move up the savings journey?
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.600]   Is there a similar set of tools that someone can use who maybe has the capability of
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.920]   saving more, but isn't?
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.760]   Yeah, I think the same set of tools apply.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.600]   You just want to increase the rate that you're saving.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.200]   So you want to think about what number is coming out of your paycheck every month.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.040]   And is that going into a diversified account set for you?
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.680]   So I think it's really about amping up the number.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.000]   The other thing is to have decision days where you could say you're going to put
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.080]   something on the calendar and reevaluate.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.760]   So, you know, one thing that you find is with finance is people worry a lot and they
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.320]   think they're not doing the right thing.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.840]   And this is kind of sad because in theory, you're just worrying all the time.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   I'd wanted more if people just worry on one day and then at the end of the day, they
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.320]   make a decision.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.400]   So you stress yourself out on a Sunday every three months.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.480]   You make some decision about adding more or withdrawing and then you forget it for
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.720]   the next three months.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.080]   We call these more decision points versus kind of overall worrying that you've made
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.680]   some mistake.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.600]   I like that idea.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.560]   But I find myself and we just had an episode talking about FOBO, which is like the fear
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.880]   of a better option, and about decision making.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.520]   And I think sometimes decision making, especially for someone who really wants to be
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.880]   optimal, can be a really stressful process that ends up taking way longer than they
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.360]   want.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.280]   Are there things you've learned about how people make decisions that could make that
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.240]   process easier and maybe a little more enjoyable?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.920]   Yes, my partner, my husband, is an optimizer and I am not.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.400]   And so I have deep experience with this.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.840]   Sometimes I will set a timer when he's trying to pick something on Amazon and say, "You
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.680]   have 15 minutes to do this."
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.640]   And so, you know, at some level, I'm sure folks, many have heard about the kind of
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.120]   explore-exploit problem, kind of the classic example here is you're on an airplane and
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.040]   either you get a list of movies, and which movie do you pick?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.480]   And an optimizer may go through the full list of movies multiple times.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.120]   And by the time they choose a movie, it's too late and they won't be able to finish
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.400]   the movie, the plane will have ended.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.680]   A satisficer may choose too early and not get an optimum movie, but maybe they've
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.280]   finished the movie by the time that the plane has landed.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.080]   And so each basically there are tradeoffs for.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   I think with the optimizer, I worry, especially in a financial construct that, again, not
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.200]   making a decision is worse than making a small wrong decision.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.800]   And so it would basically push yourself to make a decision and have some deadline
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   attached to this.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   So whether it be, you know, every quarter you make some decision and you have some
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   accountability with somebody else to do this.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.480]   By the way, accountability finances is a thing we just don't talk about that much.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.680]   This is a great podcast to have people talk about it.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.440]   But probably if you're a listener, the question is like, do you know what your mom has
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   in savings? Do you know what your best friend has in savings?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.240]   Like, probably not. And so at some level, these are tend to be private decisions.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.520]   And with private decisions, we can make excuses to procrastinate more.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.400]   So one easy hack is just telling somebody what you're doing and that itself will
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.320]   likely hold you more accountable to doing it.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.000]   A better one would be involving them in the decision and and having a bigger
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.040]   conversation about it. Again, it's to make it something from private sphere to public
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.880]   sphere. And we tend to actually follow through on our intentions then and act quicker.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.480]   And that doesn't need to be public, like post on Facebook what's in your bank account.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.320]   Yeah. So that's actually, you know, obviously, many finance companies have tried to be
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.280]   like, we're going to do social and get people to post.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.960]   It's like that. Sure, it could work in some cultures.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.600]   It's probably we're far from it, at least in the U.S.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.680]   context. It's a lot more about having just real conversations with a person that you
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.440]   trust. I do tend to find these conversations are easier to start if you're sharing a
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.200]   tip. So most of the time people don't like to ask for advice.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.080]   So, you know, what should I do?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.320]   How much should I be saving?
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.280]   I think the conversation can start easy if you're like, hey, I just learned this cool
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.560]   thing about my new bank account or credit card points.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.120]   And then you've opened up the conversation for another person to share their tip.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.080]   And all of a sudden you can start talking about finances in a different way.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.560]   Yeah, I think we don't talk about money.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.840]   Obviously, I enjoy doing it or I wouldn't be here and I've encouraged it.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:07.800]   But I wonder, have you seen any groups online that might in some way be anonymous or
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.760]   maybe personal, but with people that aren't actually your friends?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.280]   Is that something that could be helpful in a space where people aren't comfortable
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.200]   talking to each other?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.560]   Yeah, I mean, Reddit communities for money are incredible.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.920]   The amount of specific advice, obviously, you want to be skeptical of a lot of random
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.560]   people giving you advice, but at some level it's a really good forum for getting exposed
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.760]   with your finances. You could ask a question right now about this is how much I have in
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.920]   my account.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.280]   This is how much I have in debt.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.560]   What do you think I should do?
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.960]   And you'll get dozens, if not hundreds of people weighing in on your financial
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.280]   situation. So I think there's some anonymity that helps people ask for advice that's
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.040]   helpful. And just by the way, again, the nature of asking for advice is going to make
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.280]   it from private to public sphere, by which you've now made your problem something much
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.880]   more salient for you to address sooner than later.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.800]   We can always make an excuse to do something next week.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.400]   As soon as you talk about it, it's a little bit harder to make that excuse.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.720]   And that's not just because you've told someone.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.200]   But is there something that actually happens in your mind, in your brain that makes you
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.640]   feel more responsible versus just know that you've told someone?
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.480]   Yeah, it's a little bit about the reputation.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.160]   In general, this is why meetings are so lovely, is that it'd be very hard for me to
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.760]   come to a meeting and say, "I'm so sorry, I just didn't do the PowerPoint.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.360]   I just totally didn't do it." Because you know that somebody else may ask you about
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.240]   it, you act in a socially desirable way, which is to respond or do the thing that they
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.920]   might ask about. So the very understanding that in the future, you may be held
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.000]   accountable for this, even if you aren't going to be.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.160]   But that small percent chance will make us act in a desirable fashion.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.520]   So we do have this internal reputation that we're always trying to manage and protect,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.360]   at least for ourselves.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.800]   And we talked about getting things done and committing to get them done and sharing
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.360]   that. What about when you have a lot of things?
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.280]   I think one challenge is I'm an optimizer.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.880]   I want to spend five hours on Amazon.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.000]   I feel like your husband and I would have a very terrible conversation comparing
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.200]   reviews. You talk about the movie example.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.360]   And I'm like the person who I'm like, "Well, we haven't taken off, so I'm online."
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.880]   I'm like, "What's the Rotten Tomatoes score of every single movie?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.040]   Which one's the highest?" I have that problem.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.520]   But also, what about when there's just a lot of things?
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.840]   Are there things you've learned about behavioral psychology that would help people
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.480]   that are like, "I have a to-do list of 50 things, and I only have so many hours."
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.280]   And it's not necessarily that each individual one takes so long.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800]   It's just that there's so many, it becomes overwhelming.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:48.240]   Yeah. And I think at that level, you're basically looking at the prioritization
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.160]   matrix. And we tend to do things that feel good.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.240]   So we tend to do things that are easier or feel more urgent for us, especially when
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.440]   other people are asking for it.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.560]   And we tend to procrastinate the more important tasks that may level up into a
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.640]   bigger outcome later.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.600]   And so instead of basically prioritizing tasks, if you're looking at a to-do list by
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.720]   urgent or small, by the way, this is also something in credit card, folks like to pay
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.680]   off the smallest debt fastest.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.080]   And this is not the rational answer.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.400]   The rational answer should be to pay off the one with the highest interest rate.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.120]   But we look at our to-do list the same way, where we're tackling smaller tasks first.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.280]   And the correct way to do it would be to prioritize by level of importance or even
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.160]   hardest. And that's because if you start something in the morning, it's a well-known
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.640]   idea that we are better in the morning.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.320]   And so we basically assume you have a couple hours.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.120]   Actually, I love adding urgency to this.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.720]   If you think your brain stops at 11, you have like 2 hours or if you start working at
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.920]   night, 2 hours is a really good time.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.200]   What are you going to do in that time?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.000]   And we'll start with the important and hard tasks versus the urgent ones, which is
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.280]   obviously incredibly difficult to do in our working world, but something we can strive
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:01.400]   for. And are there things you've learned talking to people or doing research yourself
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.160]   that have kind of changed your perspective on this and helped you think about it
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.280]   differently? I think most people struggle with this, which is like, I think a lot of
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.520]   people internalize their struggles.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.200]   And so I think the idea that other people are also struggling with this is helpful for
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.120]   folks to remember. Other things that that I've learned in this, I mean, we basically
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   fill... It's kind of the suitcase problem where if you have a small suitcase, you'll
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.360]   fill it. If you have a large suitcase, you'll fill it.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.800]   And so I think with time, that's kind of the other big idea is that our calendars go
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.440]   from X time to X time.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.160]   And so we're going to fill it with tasks.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.760]   And so I would more try to think about like, where's your suitcase and how much do you
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.000]   get to fill? And so if you have two or three hours of good work time, would fill that
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.440]   versus eight hours and you're spreading out and probably doing the unimportant tasks.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.880]   The other thing is, you know, the calendar by default is empty, which is not true.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   I have a ton of meetings Monday through Wednesday this week, but not a lot on
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.720]   Thursday. It looks like I'm free.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.040]   I'm obviously not free. I'm going to catch up on all the work that I miss from taking
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.480]   these meetings. And my calendar is kind of lying to me in this way and telling me I'm
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.760]   free. And so the default calendar doesn't help us.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   Ideally, you can hold and block time for yourself.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.440]   We know that sometimes we overschedule it when you do that.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.400]   But at least having the mental model of this is helpful.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.200]   There's a world called pre-commitment where you think about what you're going to do.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.040]   Actually, the kind of more evolved thing of this is called implementation intentions,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.680]   where you think about when, where and how you're going to do something.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.640]   And you think about that before you do it.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.320]   Reality is that we're not actually that creative.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.760]   And so if I say I'm going to do this task, the task doesn't actually come to life in
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.480]   my mind. It's just something in the future that's going to happen as soon as we build
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.360]   it out and say when, how and where.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.400]   Now it becomes something that I've thought more deeply about.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.680]   I've kind of it's more more real.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.720]   And when we do that, it increases the likelihood that we that we actually do it.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.400]   And this has been shown with flu shots.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.920]   When you think about when, where and how you're going to get a flu shot, it's been
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.000]   shown with voting, when you think of when, where and how you're going to vote and with
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.600]   to-do lists.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   Wow.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.040]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.760]   I get it.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.960]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.400]   hang. So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.880]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.720]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.280]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.640]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.320]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.720]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.160]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.360]   selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.040]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.720]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.400]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.680]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.040]   OK, do you need to write down the when, where, how, or do you just need to think about
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.160]   it?
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.640]   So there was a nice study where there's if people do write it down, it makes you more
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.560]   likely. So thinking about it is going to help.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.320]   Writing it down is going to help more.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.680]   So I would kind of build it out in your mind and write it down.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.240]   But what this also does is basically, you know, at some level, again, we procrastinate
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.080]   things that are complex and uncertain.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.440]   And so it's reasonable if we have a task that we don't really know how we're going to
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.080]   start that we would procrastinate it.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.600]   And so just thinking for a couple of minutes on how you would start the task is really
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.280]   the win here, where you're making it less complex, less uncertain to do it.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.920]   And it'll make you more likely to want to do it because it's going to feel easier for
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.160]   you.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.560]   You said tasks that are hard and complex to start reminded me of something I've heard
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.040]   you talk about, which kind of shocked me, which is that if you don't know a lot about
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.440]   something, let's say I don't know a lot about investing and so I haven't done it, my
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.400]   assumption, just naively, which I now know is wrong, is that if I just learn more, that
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.240]   maybe I could start investing more frequently.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.720]   And I've heard you talk about this and I'd love to dig in a little more about how just
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.400]   teaching some things to someone doesn't actually change what their underlying
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.000]   behavior is.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.520]   Correct. Yeah, this is another thing where if somebody says like financial literacy at
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.840]   a party, I give them a 30 minute lecture.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.920]   Basically, the idea here is that in a perfect world, if I would teach you about what FICO
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   means and how much it impacts your life from buying a home and whatnot, you would then
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.280]   take actions to improve your FICO score.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.880]   That basically, if I give you knowledge about something, how many calories are in
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.000]   something, that you would then take steps to reduce the amount of calories.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.080]   And this is just not what researchers have found.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.240]   And it's really robust.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.320]   It's robust in the calorie literature and it's even more robust in the financial
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   literacy literature.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.160]   If I give you information about budgeting, this does not correlate to behavior change.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.360]   I'll give you a caveat, though.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.800]   So if I give you information about like, let's say, a savings account and then next to
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.560]   you is a savings teller and you can open a savings account, the immediate just-in-time
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.040]   nature of that makes it more likely that you'll do it.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.200]   But the effect decays every single hour to the point where after I think it was 24
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.600]   hours, the effect is to 0.1% behavior change, which means that if I give you information
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   about savings, a day or two later, you're 0.1% likely to actually make that behavior
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.760]   change. And so it's not zero, but it's very close to zero.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.240]   And I always say, you know, we can try to invent new ways to teach people about
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.640]   finances. Maybe we haven't tried a lot, but the paper meta-analysis cover around 200
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.880]   studies of people attempting to make this connection between teaching and doing.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.480]   And so it's a really depressing stat because financial literacy in America is
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.840]   horrific. If you ask people about compound interest, most people don't understand it.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.160]   And so the upside of financial literacy is high if we can nail it.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.560]   Sadly, it hasn't panned out and I'll kind of maybe end on an optimistic note.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.080]   The upside here is that it's the punchline is the behavioral science punchline, which
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.680]   is the environment matters.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.640]   If you make it easy for me to save, I'm more likely to save.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.360]   If you make it more appealing for me to save, I'm more likely to save.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.520]   The idea that I know what the interest rate is a couple of days before I'm about to
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.920]   make this decision just has low likelihood of changing my behavior.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.960]   But if you make the steps go from 10 to 2 or the options go from 10 complex mutual
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.760]   fund options to 3, I'm more likely to do it.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.080]   Yeah. And does this apply in other aspects of life outside of money?
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.800]   For sure. Yeah. I mean, I think in a personal life, you can imagine just trying to tell
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.000]   your spouse, like, can you please clean up the dishes?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.520]   Can you please pick up your clothes from the floor?
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.400]   Like you're giving them information in the form of nagging, but you're giving them
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.280]   information about the problem.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.280]   And in behavioral science, we say just make it make it easier, make it more appealing,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.920]   change the environment of the decision making.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.280]   But my personal example is I also, but so does my spouse, tend to throw clothes on the
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   floor. It's just easier to do that.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.520]   You know, we kind of nag at each other about like, oh, we should pick up our clothes,
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.440]   et cetera. And we developed a system that basically is like we have a laundry basket of
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:34.160]   clean clothes. And so at some level now, we've made it easier for us to clean up our
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   clothes. We don't actually have to change our behavior too much.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.200]   So we've changed the environment of decision making to get to the outcome of a clean
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.480]   space. But we haven't actually made our ourselves kind of in no amount of saying it's
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.840]   important that I do this is going to make it be when I'm running out the door in the
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.120]   morning, change my behavior.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.160]   I need to really change my environment to do that.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.400]   So I think people make this mistake with kids.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.920]   They make this mistake with family members of just telling them an information versus
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.200]   trying to actually solve the problem.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.440]   You know, if you want someone to to recycle more and make the recycle can bigger, make
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.600]   the waste can smaller.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   If you want someone to compost more, we want to make composting easier.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.640]   So, you know, you can nag and nag, but it's much more painful than just changing the
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.960]   environment. Yeah, I want to go back to your laundry situation, because I don't know if
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.440]   I quite followed. So you have a laundry basket of clean clothes.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.360]   Yeah, we have a laundry basket of dirty clothes, too, but that was obvious.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.440]   But sometimes you're not going to wash everything as you just throw it, you know,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.120]   like maybe have a coat or something and I just throw it on the ground.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.960]   And so all my goal now is to aim.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.720]   I just need to aim into the basket.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.640]   And now our room looks much cleaner than having two or three things on the floor all
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.760]   the time. This is a place to throw all the clothes that are not ready to be washed
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.880]   because maybe you just wore a sweatshirt for an hour and you want to hang it up in the
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   closet. But, you know, that's not going to happen right now because you know your
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.880]   personality. Right.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.080]   Yeah. I mean, and it's also something where like, yeah, I hang a lot of my clothes up.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.440]   But like some of the margin of error that we have is going to be high over time.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.920]   So, yes, I can put away, you know, if you have a dirty dish in order for you not to
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.160]   ever have dishes out, you'd have to have a perfect record.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.640]   The reality is once in a while you're going to leave a dish out like everyone makes
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.000]   some errors. Everyone is is messy once in a while.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And so systems should try to solve for those errors instead of solving for perfection
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.960]   and then getting mad when one or two errors happen.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:28.440]   And I think that's particularly interesting in a household thing where and for folks I
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.320]   live with, I have a communal living environment where there's there's apartments and
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.240]   there's a house and there's a communal kitchen and so there's lots of humans to make
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.120]   errors. So what kinds of systems do you have?
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.800]   Yeah, we have something called Sink Zero, which is lovely because basically it means
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   no no dishes in the sink ever.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   And that's it's a nice rule of thumb.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.280]   It's basically like, you know, saying no carbs, no saying no carbs is easier than
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.880]   saying, you know, I'm going to once in a while have or try to limit my carbs by saying
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.440]   no dishes in the sink ever. It's a very clear understanding of what to do in which
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.960]   context. By the way, this is also helpful for for spending money.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.800]   You don't want to say I'm going to spend less on something to spend less on
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.400]   restaurants. The idea would be you make a rule of thumb.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.040]   This is I don't go out to eat on the weekday or I only go out to eat once a weekend.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.640]   In that case, you know exactly what is correct.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.160]   You've either followed the rule or you haven't followed the rule.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.080]   When you say I'm going to spend less, it's very difficult to know if you've adhered to
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.160]   the rule. And if you say, oh, don't leave your dishes in the sink, that kind of implies
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   that, you know, maybe one time you can leave your dishes in the sink if you're off off
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.040]   to the races. We even have a thing where you can bring you should bring it back to your
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.520]   room instead of leaving it in the sink.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.360]   You know, like we give people the fail state of saying, we know you're in a hurry.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.400]   Just bring it to your room. So that would be one.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.720]   I think we do a lot of, again, kind of this idea that there's errors that people make.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.360]   And so you're not if you see something out, you don't get passive aggressive like, oh,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.200]   my gosh, I'm cleaning up somebody else's stuff.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.720]   You just clean it up because you've also made an error.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.800]   So you kind of have a mentality that we're all in this together.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   And at one point, I'll leave something out.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.120]   So let's let's help each other.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.560]   By the way, cooking is very interesting.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.000]   Right now we've hired a chef.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.960]   It's cheaper than if we all buy food and then we all have to divide and conquer.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   There's lots of food waste.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.680]   And so I think there's lovely ways people should look into making life much, much easier
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.960]   for themselves. Meal delivery is something most people should do.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.440]   It's actually one of the best ways to lose weight as well.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.960]   Time and time again, studies try to help people lose weight and it's very difficult.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.480]   But if you make it easy, like shipping yourself a meal every day, more people succeed.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.520]   Yeah. And there are a ton of startups that have raised money from venture capitalists
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.800]   and offer crazy deals.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.440]   So you could probably prearrange your meals from one company for a week or two and then
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.360]   switch and switch and switch and probably take advantage of promo codes to probably get
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.960]   you through at least a quarter of meals, which I may or may not have done in the past.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.160]   Yes. So, yeah.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.480]   So on that note about being healthy or losing weight, there's the food side and the
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.560]   exercise side.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:06.960]   Are there lessons that kind of tie from behavioral psychology about committing to more
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.600]   exercise? Something that I think many people struggle with and it always feels like, you
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.560]   know, you mentioned habits.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.720]   Habits aren't always the way.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.000]   And something with as high a commitment level of, you know, putting on a pair of shorts
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.280]   and shoes and going out for 45 minutes is maybe not something you could build a habit
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.440]   around. Are there tricks or lessons that can help here?
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.880]   Yeah, that's the same thing as exercise.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.360]   It's very difficult to form a habit.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.120]   The one latest study I saw says it took six months.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:38.760]   And as soon as you have a habit, it does become easier because you need less intention to
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.080]   do it. But when you don't have a habit, you actually need to form an intention to do a
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:48.640]   behavior. And so one idea is that you're actually forming the habit based on the getting
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.920]   ready. So, you know, putting your shoes out, et cetera.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.160]   That's the habit that you're trying to establish versus the habit of exercise.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.920]   That action has been shown to drive some higher adherence.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.360]   The other one is just past behavior predicts future behavior.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.800]   And so the best predictor of forming a habit is actually doing it.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.080]   It's not a cheat sheet.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.280]   It's just it's just real.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.320]   And so, you know, I think at some level people, if they commit to routines and
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.640]   consistency, this is fine.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   And if you miss a day, that's OK, too.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.880]   And then, you know, I'm a big fangirl of Peloton.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.680]   I think Peloton makes it more fun to do workouts.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.760]   They have these instructors that are quite compelling.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.360]   I talked to the product manager at Peloton and he said, look, we, you know, we have these
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.720]   challenges that start every month.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.400]   And so there's this idea of fresh start where you can basically say, you know, today I'm a
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.520]   different person. Peloton actually helps you do that all the time right there.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.360]   It's like you can say today I'm going to join on Dolly Parton Day.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.160]   We need to give ourselves an excuse to start something.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.560]   And so fresh start doing it on Mondays or the first day of the month can be one.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.360]   Or joining a challenge for a short period of time is one.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.560]   But increasing our motivation in order to get over the friction is definitely going to
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.080]   help kind of fuel the exercise fire.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.560]   And then, you know, I think there's some level of variety and consistency.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.280]   I think people kind of stick to the same workout and I would encourage folks to try
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   something different, if not just to appreciate the main workout that you do.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:16.280]   But we can tire quickly from doing the same thing every day.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.760]   Yeah, as soon as I'm done with my broken foot, I intend to go for the fresh start.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:28.080]   So when you think about longer term goals, things that you want to change over the year,
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.680]   change over the next couple of years, how do you think you can effectively do that?
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.320]   Are you a fan of New Year's resolutions?
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.720]   Are you a fan of things like that?
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.680]   Yeah, I think, you know, I think people give New Year's resolutions a lot of they kind of
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.960]   get made fun of. And at some level, it's a really nice excuse to think about what you want
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.800]   to do and who you want to be and create that, you know, I said before, implementation
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.960]   intention for your goals. I think goals by themselves are pretty useless.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.400]   We need the plan. We need to connect it to action. We need to tell somebody.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.560]   So I think, yeah, the idea of just saying I'm going to do this is not going to change
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.640]   your behavior. I think what can is creating the plan and redesigning your environment
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.160]   to support that. You know, one big opportunity for change is when we have change in our life.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.720]   So habits, back to habits, habits are very, very difficult because you're trying to do
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.960]   something new in a world where you're very used to doing the same thing every day.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.080]   So Wendy Wood has researched this, like 43% of our behaviors every day are habitual.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.880]   We're just not thinking about it. This is driving and the coffee and the brushing the teeth.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.240]   And so at some level, introducing something new, it's reasonable to say, my gosh, that's
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.960]   going to be difficult because I'm so used to doing the things I normally do.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.760]   And so really, there's an interesting opportunity when you disrupt your environment.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   So when you change jobs, when you move, when you have a child, maybe when you're traveling,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.480]   this is when your environment changes and your habits are disrupted.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.760]   The theory here is called habit discontinuity theory, by which you're basically breaking
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.880]   something. And this is the golden moment to be able to add something new.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.160]   There's a nice study, kind of a classic one that was done in the London tube system by
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.900]   which they shut it down for a couple of days.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.760]   And you know, people are really habitual creatures when it comes to commute. And so people then
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.640]   had to find another route to work when their station was shut down.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.760]   And five percent of people found more optimal routes.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.360]   This is interesting because if you're so, you know, commute is all about optimization
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.200]   and efficiency. And why didn't these people think of that beforehand?
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.560]   Like what were they doing walking a longer way to a different station that was longer
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.160]   for them? It took some disruption for them to seek out an alternative and then they were
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.360]   able to stick with it.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.920]   And so when we disrupt our normal routines is when we can start kind of looking around
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.880]   and saying, is there something optimal to do?
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.280]   So I think if I could, I'd get everyone to move more.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.400]   You know, we should be moving apartments more. We should be moving jobs more. We should be
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.920]   changing our environment much more.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.640]   Those are all kind of big disruptions. I heard you mention if you have a kid, I can imagine
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.800]   if you were like, gosh, I really want to start eating healthy. I need to disrupt my life.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.180]   Maybe having a child is a big step. Are there ways to kind of manufacture disruption in
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.180]   your life?
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.340]   Yeah, I mean, I think so. Add a new one, get new friends, which is not probably not as
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:15.620]   hard as a kid. But, you know, we are who we surround ourselves with. And so one way to
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:20.020]   change your environment is maybe is not if it's not physically is to surround yourself
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.020]   with different people.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.460]   So I think kind of an easier way to do it, maybe to expose yourself to different people.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.140]   This could be joining a running group. This could be going to different lectures by which
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.740]   your mental, your cognitive environment then is changing and the influences on your environment
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.540]   are also changing. So that would be a bigger swing.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.900]   And then the other one, you know, I had a friend who hired a kind of a minimalist coach
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.720]   to come over and help them redesign their apartment. Sometimes it's hard for us to understand
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.540]   our own environment. And so I think, again, bringing other people in to say like, help
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:55.780]   me redesign my kitchen so that I'm more likely to eat better. You know, this is changing
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.900]   where the chips go. This is changing where the veggies go in the fridge. By the way,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.700]   I think instapots are lovely. You know, cooking is very hard. It's not ideal. It takes work
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.800]   and so if we can make it fundamentally easier, we should do that. And you may not have the
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.860]   intuition on changing your environment as much as somebody else does.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.420]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show. Your support is

[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.180]   us.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.420]   So one thing I noticed, we changed our daughter's room around this weekend. Totally changed,
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.060]   like basically moved every piece of furniture. And it now feels like a different room. I'm
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.860]   wondering if that's enough. You know, could rearranging your living room or your bedroom
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:51.260]   be enough of a disruption to really like jumpstart a new habit or not habit, but a new a new
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   change?
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.020]   I think it's worth trying. I think these things are 100% worth trying. Like, you know, the
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.740]   idea that these things are, it's just reversible too. If you change it, you can always change
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.580]   it. Like, yeah, I think probably changing furniture around, if you're a female, getting
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.940]   a haircut could change how you, I once had a little pink strip in my hair and people,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.700]   they actually talked to me more, but, you know, baristas and restaurant folks would
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.820]   engage more. I don't know if felt more friendly or open, but, you know, it changed my environment
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.100]   by nature of how people related to me. So, so I think all these small changes are good.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.980]   Look, the, the idea that we've landed on the optimal way to live and be is just silly,
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.060]   right? Like we've accidentally chose many things in our life. We've accidentally kind
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.740]   of opted into the life that we're living. Many of that has been by choice and by design,
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:40.180]   but it's hard to imagine that there wouldn't be small ways that we could change it to improve
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.740]   it. And by just by changing it, actually we could, we could likely improve it because
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.660]   of the nature of change.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:50.740]   So when you brought up the commuting example, if you had asked me, Oh, what are ways that
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.060]   you could have a more optimal day? I might never have thought of that. Is there a process
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   or, or even just a list of things that people could kind of take inventory of that would
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:06.140]   allow you to discover ways that you could maybe, you know, be more optimal or intentional
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.100]   that wouldn't come to mind if you just thought about it?
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.660]   That's a great question. So I'll kind of go with the obvious, but it's going to be a harder
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.820]   one for people to, to optimize immediately. You know, one thing that makes us most happy
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:25.700]   is people. We tend to spend money on things. If you're buying a home, you look at the countertops
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.340]   and how well the bathrooms are done, not will you like your neighbors? And so why do I live
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.140]   with all these people? It's because I've optimized my life for happiness, right? If we think
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.900]   happiness is about relationships, which most studies show that it is, then you want to
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.780]   design your life to make relationships easier. And so I think one thing that people could
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:48.260]   do in general to optimize their life is to make relationships easier. I'll give a tactical
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.260]   example.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.220]   Here is that the weekend's lovely because it's a coordinated event. Do we have two days
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   where we can all socially hang out and people are actually happier on the weekend. Even
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.300]   unemployed people are happier on the weekend. So it's not about work. It's just about the
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.880]   idea of coordinating with other people. And so I think we can use a calendar in a way
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:10.460]   here to coordinate with other people such that you could say every Saturday, you're
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:15.100]   going to schedule a brunch at 11 a.m. on Dolores Park, where people just bring bagels and your
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:19.300]   friends know to show up. It's difficult to always coordinate plans with people. And maybe
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.780]   sometimes some friends won't show up, but maybe sometimes a few will. And so you have
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.420]   a core group of people who just know 11 a.m. brunch on Saturday. This takes away the annoyingness
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.700]   of back and forth calendaring that prevents us from doing something. And you can imagine
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:37.500]   doing this for Zoom workouts at 8 a.m. on one day. You could imagine doing it for game
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.540]   nights once a month, the first Friday of the month or something with your friends.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:47.280]   The goal here is just to make things that make us happier, easier. And if we believe
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.500]   that relationships make us happy, then we want to make that easier for us to actually
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.220]   do. So hacking a calendar is one way to do it with social coordination.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.660]   Are there any other non-obvious things that you think make people generally happier that
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.660]   we don't think about?
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:07.420]   Yeah. I actually think complimenting people is... Chris, you're looking very good today.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.780]   The smile is great. Your look with the black shirt. Very professional. So I said this as
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.460]   an example, but it actually turns out that fake compliments, people also feel very good
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:23.460]   at as well. And so I think we can basically help people feel better if we're complimenting
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:29.780]   them and also we're getting compliments. It's very, very easy to create affinity that way.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:34.600]   And that goes in the giving research where if I already give you $20, you're happier
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.980]   if you spend it on somebody else. And if you spend it on yourself... Now, obviously, it's
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.380]   probably that money goes up to lots of money. You can say... We can argue, "If I give you
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.640]   a million dollars and you give it away, are you happy?" But at small dollar amounts like
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:53.460]   this, we can actually be much happier by giving stuff away. And the very easy thing you can
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.340]   do right now is probably just compliment somebody. A genuine compliment is better. But even if
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.300]   it's not, it's probably helpful.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.160]   One thing I know I've talked to you in the past about the work you do with companies.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.400]   And I know you have a process for how you take a company's product and try to break
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:18.360]   down ways that it could be improved. And one of those steps is, I believe, a behavioral
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.640]   diagnostic. Is that... Am I close?
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.820]   Yeah. Yeah. Nailed it. Softball for me here.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:29.040]   Can you apply that same methodology? And maybe feel free to talk about that process. But
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.240]   I'm curious after whether you could apply that to your own day and do a diagnostic of
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.880]   your average day.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:43.360]   Love it. Yeah. So basically, a behavioral diagnosis is a map, this visual map of every
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.560]   single step and decision that you make in order to get to the behavior that you're aiming
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   for.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:59.040]   So if I want to save money once a month, $10, making this up as a bank, I would do
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.520]   a behavioral diagnosis that says, "I need to log in. I need to remember my password.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.800]   Oh, shoot. I forgot my password. I have to remember my password or go to my email." And
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.440]   I go through all the steps that somebody has to do and the decisions in order to get to
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.880]   this key behavior.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.240]   And when we walk through this with companies, there's so many light bulbs of people realizing
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.480]   how much work people have to do. And this is like logistical friction, actual steps,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.440]   but most of it's cognitive friction of things that people have to decide and think about
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.120]   before they can actually succeed in the behavior that you're aiming to change.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.360]   So the first step in that is actually figuring out the behavior that you want to change,
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.880]   which is definitely a personal opportunity. And we call it, at Irrational Labs, getting
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.680]   uncomfortably specific. So instead of saying, "I want to save money or I want to eat healthy,"
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.280]   it's like, "I want to eat a salad every day for lunch for a week."
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.000]   Now we've been obnoxiously uncomfortably specific about the behavior such that the
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.840]   hack or the intervention is just going to be easier than saying, "I want to eat healthier."
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.720]   And so for ourselves, I think we need to get more specific about the behavior. It's not
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.320]   going to help us if we say, "I want to eat healthier. I want to be financially better
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.640]   off or I want to be happier."
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.920]   We need to get to that behavior. And at that point, then you can do this diagnostic where
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.680]   you're like, "Let me do a map of every single step that it would take to get to that."
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.120]   If you're trying to date right now and you want to say, "I want to go on a date a week,"
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.080]   what are all the steps that it would take for you to do that? You'd have to be swiping
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.100]   maybe every morning. You'd have to be responding to messages in the evening. You'd have to
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.440]   keep one night open. Many people are very busy and you have one night open.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.360]   So at some level, walking through all those steps, you can then see like, "Wow, this is
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.720]   actually harder than I thought. Let me try to call it the 3B model where we're either
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.560]   going to reduce barriers or increase benefits." So once we've picked a behavior, 3B. So the
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.200]   behavior, the barriers and the benefits. You pick a behavior, you decrease the barriers
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.280]   and you increase the benefits to doing that.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:58.600]   So we make it easier and we make it highly motivating. Barriers and benefits. And so
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.780]   the diagnostic then you look at this and you say, "Let me just make it easy. Let me decrease
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:07.160]   the barriers to doing something and I'll be more likely to do it or I add some fun benefits."
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:13.760]   Yeah. So I think we're fortunate that people like yourselves take all of your skills, helping
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.240]   companies do this. Mostly, at least as far as I can tell, for good. Working with companies
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.360]   to help people save more, working with that kind of thing.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.840]   There are plenty of companies out there that I think have learned these same tactics and
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:33.260]   use them to get you to scroll endlessly on TikTok or various other habits that are very
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:39.700]   beneficial to companies, but maybe not beneficial to your life. Are there tips you have for
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:46.480]   people who are trying to avoid getting sucked into companies who have learned all the same
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.440]   tricks but maybe are applying them to ways that are less optimal for their lives?
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:56.040]   Yeah. So first, I think realizing that you're walking into a really hard environment. If
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.400]   you go to a mall, how could you not spend money? People have thought deeply about how
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.500]   to get you to spend money. They've thought deeply about getting you to buy something
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.420]   that is kind of aspirationally good for you, but may not increase your happiness. And so
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.980]   it's a really hard fight that we have. And it's getting harder. Like Amazon Prime making
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.440]   it... We said one of the ways to get us to do something is to make it easier. Online
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   now Amazon Prime is the goldmine of that. And we have now Amazon Go stores where you
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.700]   just walk out, right? They figured something out about human behavior and it's going to
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:32.720]   be hard for us to fight that. I think at some level, the macro solution is disappointing
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.760]   for people is we actually need companies to design better environments. And that's what
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.560]   we try to help companies do is design better environments to help us succeed because it's
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.880]   so difficult for ourselves to kind of fight these forces. And maybe the uplifting thing
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.860]   is we can. So from a focus perspective, there's plenty of apps out there that can help you
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:58.680]   focus more. There's RescueTime that gives you data, which data usually isn't enough.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.320]   There's a new app that I just used that if you go to anything other than the screen you're
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   on, a voice will come on and keep talking to you until you go back to your screen. These
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:13.040]   are these self-controlled basic devices where you have to have a one-time motivation to
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.920]   put them on yourself. And it's tough. And so I think that's the upside. In a hot state,
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.740]   we're not going to stop eating the chips. We're not going to stop Netflix on show one
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.980]   when you want to binge on show two and three. We can't rely on ourselves to make those decisions
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.460]   in the heat of the moment. We need to make these implementation intentions before or
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.780]   put kind of self-control devices up. This is difficult. So typically around 30% of people
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.200]   that research, it's like, "Are you a sophisticated, somebody who understands that in the future,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.700]   you will fail? Or are you a naivete, somebody who has more optimism and thinks in the future
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.220]   you may succeed despite all the forces?" And sophisticated are a little bit, are much
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.980]   better at putting on these self-control devices to ourselves. So asking, you know, when you
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.780]   go up to the counter, nobody's preventing you from asking McDonald's to say, "Can I
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:04.740]   have half the fries? I want some fries. Can I have half?" This is something that we could
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.620]   all do and it's difficult. And so that's one of the reasons why you just don't ask for
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.940]   the fries in the first place is because you know you're going to eat them all. But yeah,
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.860]   I would, I would encourage folks to think about the behavior you want to change and
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:20.980]   then the apps or tools that can help you do it in a cold state, not in a hot one.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:27.940]   And does just discovering the biases that we have help? I know that it seems like from
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.420]   some of our conversation that just learning about how your brain works and how you might
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.860]   think about things doesn't really help. But I know that I've been to a handful of kind
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.820]   of unconscious bias trainings that now I'm wondering like, are those even effective at
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.060]   changing anyone's behavior?
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:50.820]   Yeah. So the research does not look promising for unconscious bias trainings. I'm sure that
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:55.580]   they're improving, that new companies are coming out and trying to improve them. So
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.900]   I would say, you know, I may be wrong in the latest company, but most research to date
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:05.060]   does not look promising for basically teaching you about your bias, actually changing your
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:10.260]   behavior, which is why, you know, if you're thinking from a hiring standpoint, you want
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:15.380]   to blind the resumes so that you're not seeing names or you're not seeing pictures. You don't
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.020]   want to look at the school that people came from right away because this may influence
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:23.260]   you. Actually, turning your video off is good in the first interview, so you're not biased
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.380]   by looks. And so these are the types of things that will actually help us make better and
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.700]   more equitable decision making. Teaching us about our biases so that in the future we
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.700]   can become better people is not likely to work.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:40.300]   Okay. So future is not necessarily promising for learning, but I like that you've taught
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.620]   us a ton of different processes and things we can put into place to kind of plan for
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:51.580]   what we know we are not good at. Are there any other parting hacks for life, money, travel,
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.420]   anything that you want to share that we haven't gotten to hear?
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:01.540]   Yes. Okay. I have a couple. One is the hedonic treadmill is real, which means like once you
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:08.020]   have something, you adapt to it and you want more of it. So this is especially relevant
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:13.100]   if you are potentially surrounded by other people who have the thing. And I think this
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.420]   makes me very nervous because if you go and you buy a four bedroom house, your next house
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:22.100]   is not going to be a three bedroom house. You've made a decision to lock yourself into
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:28.780]   something that's going to be hard to downgrade. So I would be very, very cautious of making
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:32.860]   decisions that try to upgrade your lifestyle too quickly because you're cognitively going
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.940]   to be locked in and you adapt to things so much that it's not, you know, if I have nice
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.060]   countertops or not, it does not change my happiness levels or my life satisfaction.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.740]   And yet if you have lovely countertops in their next house, you have bad ones. This
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.860]   is going to be difficult for you. I don't wear jewelry, zero, no earrings, no necklace,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.860]   no rings, nothing. There's some level of like, if I wanted, if I started wearing a necklace
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.980]   or earrings, I would just want better ones. I'd be on the treadmill. And so I've decided
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.500]   for jewelry to get off the treadmill, to just not participate. And I think that actually
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.820]   is very nice to pick a few categories in life where you're just not going to be on the treadmill.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.900]   You're not going to participate. I think this could be, you know, if you're not a foodie,
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.340]   you know, do you really need to go out to the very nice restaurants? Some foodies, I
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.980]   get it. You want to, but you can choose to opt out of some of these categories. The jewelry
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.860]   that, you know, for women, it's clothes and shoes. It could be makeup. You can say, this
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.940]   is just not something I'm going to compete in or want to aspire to. And once you do,
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:34.940]   it's going to again, be harder to get off. And then the other one for travel is around
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:40.220]   memory and a lot of kind of happiness comes. There's kind of a debate in the literature.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:45.820]   Is it, is it, am I happy because of the moment I'm happy or am I happy when I remember something
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:51.820]   in the past? And when we think about memory, we want to create a lot of peak experiences.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.220]   And so if I were designing a vacation, I probably wouldn't have you go on a vacation for two
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:02.020]   weeks somewhere. I'd probably have you go either multiple vocations of three-day weekends
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:06.500]   where you're creating lots of small experiences for yourself that are memorable and exciting.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.260]   You have something to look forward to every weekend. You have something to reflect on
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.040]   when you come back versus kind of a two-week vacation in the middle of the year or within
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.260]   that two-week vacation have multiple peak points where you're going in different places
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.860]   to create memories. And that's something we can do in our daily lives as well. We're just
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:27.980]   kind of making sure that one month doesn't blend to the next and creating more peak experiences
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   and memories for us. A group of friends and I went to Valencia street in San Francisco
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:38.220]   that closed off the streets on Fridays. And we set up a table and had a fancy dinner in
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:42.900]   the middle of the street. Okay. We had tacos, but we all dressed up. We put, there was lamps
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.660]   and a generator and classical music. This is weird. We're not going to do it every weekend.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:51.660]   But by doing these kind of weird, crazy things once in a while, we can create kind of meaningful
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:56.340]   experiences. These are nice things to talk about. It's a high memory. It's not going
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:00.260]   to be like every Friday night that we have. And so we should probably put more work into
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:04.660]   creating these kind of peak experiences versus having normal Friday nights.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:09.260]   Yeah. Any other favorite peak experiences that like, I want to hear your list?
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:14.180]   I do this no small talk card thing. So in general, I think conversation tends to go
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:19.060]   to the lowest common denominator where if you're in a room with people, it doesn't benefit
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.940]   you to go up to somebody and say, what is your deepest fear? This is awkward. You put
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:28.140]   yourself at risk. I don't recommend it. And it's not good for anyone if you're just talking
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:32.260]   about mundane or you know, the weather or sports, you're just not going to enjoy yourself
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:36.820]   that much. So this is a problem. And so how do you overcome this problem? And this kind
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.340]   of goes back to the weekend question of coordination.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.420]   If everybody agrees that you're going to talk about your deepest fear, then it's not weird
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.560]   for you to go up to somebody and ask them. It'd be weird for you to talk about small
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.940]   talk if everybody has agreed that you're going to be talking about more vulnerable or interesting
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.660]   things that evening. And so one thing to do if you have a group of friends you're hosting
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:00.500]   over or in general, kind of a host of something is to mandate that people talk about interesting
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.240]   things. And I have these no small talk cards that, you know, are kind of decision aids
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.500]   in this. So I just say don't talk about small talk things. People get nervous and what should
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.380]   I talk about? And so actually, we did an experiment here and people really don't like it if you
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.660]   just say don't talk small talk. It's hard to think of these things. As soon as we give
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.900]   the cards to people, it becomes much easier and people enjoy it. They make more connections.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.740]   They want to hang out with each other for longer. And they're talking about a bigger
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:31.900]   variety of topics. And so I would give your party members some decision aids or some help
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:36.120]   if you go this route. And by the way, we are happier when we talk about these vulnerable
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.540]   things. We like each other more.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.700]   So what are your biggest fears? Any other good topics for someone that wants to put
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.140]   this into place for friends coming over in the next few days?
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.660]   Yeah, I think, you know, we did an experiment where we talked about what is the best question.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:56.020]   And so we had a two conditions where it was like talk about the past was one was a few
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:01.380]   parties or talk about the future was a few other parties. So two conditions. What do
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.820]   you think was better at predicting vulnerability?
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   The past.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:12.340]   That's what we thought, too. And it turns out there was no difference. So both conditions
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.900]   beat out the control. The control was just kind of an activity, a random activity that
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.100]   didn't push conversation. So the upside here is that talking about anything interesting
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.940]   is going to be helpful. But you can think about getting people to pontificate about
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:29.260]   their future self, either their hopes or dreams or their past. When's the last time that you've
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.540]   been in love? Are you more like your father or your mother? Or, you know, one of my favorite
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:38.620]   is what do you want to be complimented on more? This actually helps reveal a lot about
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.900]   somebody. It says, you know what, I'm not complimented on this. And I personally think
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.020]   that it's a strength of mine that that may go unseen. It also gives you an in to compliment
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.020]   them on that.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:53.020]   So which we know, which we know creates happiness, even if it's even if it's fake. Yeah. Awesome.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.580]   This was fantastic. I want to hear a little about what you're working on and about this
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.540]   podcast that came out yesterday.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:03.420]   Wonderful. Yeah. So I'll start there. The podcast is called The Science of Change. And
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.540]   the idea here is that we interview visionary thought leaders from companies that are trying
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.860]   to change our behavior. So we talked to Peloton to figure out how they designed an addicting
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:16.860]   exercise program and Duolingo to figure out how they get us to learn a language and Credit
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:21.260]   Karma to figure out how they get us out of debt. And behavioral science is really about
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.300]   the environment that we live in. And so we're trying to deep dive with the people who are
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:29.180]   actually designing our environment and all the apps and products and services we use.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:34.940]   So I'm very excited about The Science of Change. And it is out with the Peloton episode being
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.660]   our first. And then Irrational Labs. So folks are interested in behavior change, behavioral
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:47.140]   science. Irrational Labs is a behavior change company co-founded by myself and Dan Ariely.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:51.260]   We have boot camps, we have trainings, and we do a lot of consulting with companies to
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:55.980]   help design new products and features that change behavior for good. And if you go to
