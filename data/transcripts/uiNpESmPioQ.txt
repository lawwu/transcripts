[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   The following is a conversation with Travis Stevens,
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.440]   2016 Olympic silver medalist in judo
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.720]   and one of the greatest American judoka ever.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.360]   But his story is inspiring,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.380]   not because of that Olympic medal,
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.280]   but because of the decades of injury, hardship,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.840]   incredible battles against the best in the world,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.000]   wrapping up in close, heartbreaking losses
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   at the 2008 and 2012 games,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.000]   all of which eventually led
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400]   to that very silver medal in 2016.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.240]   As we talk about in the podcast,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.320]   Travis is also someone who's largely responsible
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.000]   for me getting into judo,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.480]   for which I will forever be grateful.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.680]   He also happens to be now my judo coach and mentor.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.440]   I'll release a video of Travis and I
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.820]   doing some judo in a few days.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.140]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.600]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840]   As a side note, let me say a few words
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.200]   that I've written down about the Olympic Games
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560]   and the International Olympics Committee.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.380]   I'm visiting family, hence the T-shirt,
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.680]   but I had to pull away to write and to say these words
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.680]   because this very video was taken down by YouTube
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920]   as per the request of the IOC.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.400]   You know it's serious when a Russian takes time away
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   from family, food, and drink.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.000]   I'm heartbroken to see continued incompetence,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.780]   greed, and corruption on the part of the IOC
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.720]   in failing to do as the Olympic Charter states to quote,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.080]   "Ensure the fullest coverage
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.640]   "and the widest possible audience in the world
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.060]   "for the Olympic Games," end quote.
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.880]   I want to give you two facts.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   First, they do not make most of the videos
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.300]   of the games available for replay anywhere
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.400]   that is accessible, searchable, and discoverable,
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.060]   whether funded by ads or by subscriptions.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.340]   For example, on YouTube or their own service.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.440]   It is not available anywhere.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.860]   Second, in the most absurd violation
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520]   of the Olympic Charter, they've uploaded all of the videos
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   of the 2012, 2016, and the 2020/21 Olympics to YouTube,
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.160]   and they set all of these videos to private.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   This results in a situation like my four-hour conversation
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.360]   that you're watching now with Travis Stevens
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.820]   being taken down due to us including a few seconds
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.320]   of a small video overlay of Travis's epic match
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.560]   against Ole Bischoff in 2012.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.200]   This is done automatically as per the request of the IOC.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.560]   I have the video due to having screen recorded it from 2012.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.660]   Here you have Travis Stevens, an Olympic silver medalist,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.860]   someone who spent his entire life overcoming injuries,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.600]   losses, hard weight cuts, periods of no financial
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.780]   or psychological support, culminating
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.060]   in the biggest heartbreak of his career.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.620]   In this one match, and this match is available nowhere
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.540]   online, not for free, not for $1 million.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.460]   Our showing short clips of it results
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.680]   in the IOC taking it down, not demonetizing it,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   taking it down, blocking it.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.140]   The IOC silences this amazing story of Travis Stevens,
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.740]   of heartbreak that eventually led to triumph.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.940]   And there are thousands of stories like it,
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.820]   stories that are supposed to inspire the world.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.500]   To me and to billions of others,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.820]   the Olympic Games give a chance to celebrate
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.420]   and to be inspired by the greatest stories
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.220]   of human flourishing in the face of hardship
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.020]   and incredibly long odds or dominance
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.680]   in the pursuit of perfection at levels previously thought
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.300]   to be impossible.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.700]   The Olympic Games inspire kids like me to dream
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.200]   and to work hard to achieve in our own lives,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.140]   the same moments of magic and greatness,
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.600]   small or big, that the Olympic Games reveal.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.180]   I believe the members of the IOC are good people,
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.020]   but people who forgot the dream,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.300]   the fire that was sparked and burned in their hearts
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.080]   when they first saw the Olympics as kids.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.460]   They've allowed the gradual corruption
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.380]   of their own human spirit, and thereby have robbed the world
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.200]   of this very fire, the fire of the Olympic torch,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   the fire that ought to burn in the eyes and hearts of kids
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.280]   watching the Olympics today,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.580]   daring to dream, daring to be great.
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.860]   Please, please do better.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.960]   The world needs you.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.380]   The world needs the Olympic Games.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.680]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.960]   and here's my conversation with Travis Stevens.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.400]   Judo is a martial art, a sport, a set of techniques,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   ideas, and philosophies.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.620]   Can we start by maybe you giving a big picture overview
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.440]   of what is judo to somebody who's like outside
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.780]   the whole spectrum of grappling sports?
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.700]   - Yeah, judo was originated in Japan that was used
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   as a police tactic for self-defense and subduing people.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.960]   It's the art of being able to throw somebody to the ground
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.440]   and hold and control the situation.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.320]   I think it's pretty much evolved since then, though.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.800]   It's, as you include the sport aspect of it,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.440]   it's grown to be something more and more dynamic,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.040]   and it's kind of gotten away from that.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.000]   - So the basics is people wear something called a gi,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   which I think nicely mimics outdoor clothing, like a jacket.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.140]   And they start on the feet,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.820]   and they get to grip each other,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.100]   and the scoring works by the more badass the throw is,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.460]   the more points you get.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   And if you throw the person big and hard on their back,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.620]   you win the match and it's over, and that's called an ippon.
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.260]   - Yep, which is equivalent to a knockout.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.180]   - So I guess there's no knockdowns in judo.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.740]   - We don't count those.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.920]   They gotta hit their back,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.900]   and they gotta hit it with force.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.940]   - And so there's a huge incentive for the big throws.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.780]   - Yeah.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.780]   - And there's also the drama of somebody catching you
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.940]   off guard with a surprise big throw and it's over.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.180]   - Yep, there's two ways of losing, really.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.340]   There's the, I saw this coming, right?
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   Like you just, you see it, but you can't stop it.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.020]   And those ones tend to be the ones you can live with.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.160]   The ones that are like really hard to live with
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.320]   are the ones you never saw coming, right?
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.120]   'Cause that just shows that
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   that person has really outclassed you.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.760]   - Right, so there's like a set of, a small set of throws,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.260]   maybe we can go through them, that are like,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.920]   you saw it coming, but you couldn't do anything about it.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.640]   And then there's the set of throws
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.560]   that are more like surprises.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.360]   So first of all, the counters,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.440]   or if you fake one thing and go the other way,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.600]   then that's a surprise and it's like, oh shit.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.780]   You off-balanced the person
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.260]   because they think you're going one way
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.200]   and then you go the other way.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.740]   And then it's just, oh shit moment, all of a sudden,
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.420]   your back is just slammed on the ground.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.580]   One of the ones, I mean, you're good of many throws,
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.860]   but one of them is a,
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.780]   that I think reveals the beauty of judo is the foot sweep.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.920]   There's something about the off-balance and the timing
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.420]   that if you catch him right, all of a sudden,
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.860]   it's like I had the same feeling when skydiving,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.620]   like all of a sudden the ground is not under you anymore.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.440]   - Yeah, and you just, you go weightlessness
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.600]   for like a split second
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.920]   and you realize you've lost like all control of your limbs.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.520]   Like it's like zero gravity, right?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.720]   Like you just, you can't turn, you can't rotate,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.200]   you can't do much of anything.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.120]   And then before you know it, you've hit the floor.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.160]   - Yeah.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   It's a cool feeling when you get thrown
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.800]   because you hope to do the same thing to another person.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   It's like, you just hit the ground hard
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.480]   because it's not, you didn't see it coming.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.800]   It wasn't a big throw that got loaded up.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.420]   It's like all of a sudden, surprise.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.060]   And then like this like feeling your back just slams
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.820]   and there's like the air is up.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.000]   - Yeah, and the worst is when you get hit twice
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.140]   with one throw, right?
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.080]   Because sometimes like the guy throwing you
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.380]   didn't expect you to leave either.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.800]   So you hit and then that guy comes down
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.020]   like a second and a half later and it's like, boom, boom.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.900]   And then the wind is just gone from you.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.180]   - Yeah.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.100]   - Those are the worst.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.780]   - And then there's the disappointment.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.520]   Like then the intellectual, the cognitive part comes in
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.280]   where you're like, oh shit, I just lost.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.160]   - Yep, and you don't have like a connection to why, right?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.180]   It's almost like you've just,
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.840]   like you didn't literally get a concussion.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   Like you understand and remember everything,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.880]   but you can't figure out how this just happened, right?
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.200]   Those are the tough ones to deal with.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.240]   - Actually, have you had moments like that
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.180]   where you don't understand how it happened?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.080]   You have to watch footage to understand what happened?
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.280]   - Even when you watch it, you're just like,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.980]   I don't get it.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.320]   Like, why wasn't I in a position to stop this?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.080]   It makes zero sense.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.520]   Conceptually, when you watch it, you're like,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.560]   I understand how to play defense.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.820]   I understand, it looks like I'm in a defensive position,
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.580]   but at the end of the day, I still got thrown.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.940]   - Yeah, you were talking about, what is it, a 2008 match?
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.020]   You have a non-traditional gripping style,
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.540]   is that accurate to say?
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.620]   But, and then you were going against
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.780]   another right-handed player,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.020]   and then there was some kind of fake that he did,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.740]   and then he caught you.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.700]   - Yep.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.660]   - Can you describe the throw he caught you with?
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.940]   - He caught me with a drop sail,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.580]   but he kind of like, we were engaged,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.820]   we were looking at each other,
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.460]   and we were kind of at like a stalemate, right?
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.060]   He couldn't really advance, I couldn't really advance,
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.660]   and he kind of just let his gaze like,
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.380]   wander off to the right, like he was looking at something,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.980]   and then I kind of like, what's over there?
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.080]   And then I got thrown.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.380]   And it's like.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.460]   - So first of all, for people who don't know,
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   seo is seoi nage, drop means when you drop to your knees,
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.620]   and seoi nage is one of the fundamental throws of judo,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.180]   there's just a handful.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.700]   But, does that actually ever work?
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.500]   I always wondered that about like, boxing or judo,
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.180]   does the head movement of the person work?
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.460]   'Cause we're still like, kind of dogs at heart.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.480]   If you look somewhere with a dog,
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.660]   the dog is gonna look that direction as well.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.020]   Does that actually work ever?
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.960]   - It does.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.420]   But on a greater sense, what you try to do
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.940]   is not necessarily get like, a physical reaction of a look,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.640]   but a lull of security where like,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.720]   they've almost like, relaxed for that split second
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   because you've lured them into like, a sense of comfort.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.380]   And then that's when you can strike.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.640]   - So you have this, speaking of seoi nage,
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   you have this gigantic standing seoi nage.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.160]   - Yep.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.240]   - And you have a specific grip.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.080]   One of our challenges is, there's a large number of people
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.280]   that listen to the audio version of this.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.200]   So we're gonna have to try to describe some of this stuff.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.640]   I'll do my best to try to describe with words.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.260]   But you have, you grip with your left hand
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.040]   on the lapel of the jacket or like, that area.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.880]   - Yep.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.080]   - And there's kind of a lean into the person.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.320]   And I suppose, is there a feeling of a lull there
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.240]   that you're trying to get to where you're just,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.640]   it feels like you're both calmly dancing
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.280]   before you turn your hips and go in for the throw?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   - I'm actually trying to create a sense of weightlessness
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.120]   for my lead leg, which would be my right leg.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   And a sense of resistance from my partner.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.440]   - So aren't you both kind of leaning into each other?
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   - Into each other and it creates like an A-frame.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.040]   - Yeah.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.900]   - But when the A-frame is held together at the top half,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.920]   which would be my left hand and their right hand
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.560]   posted on each other's chest,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.600]   it means our legs are free to move
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.640]   and our hips are free to move.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.480]   - Right.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.680]   And they're not gonna feel your leg move.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.040]   - Because of the weightlessness.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.200]   - And is there a feeling like, for them,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.280]   is there a feeling like nothing bad can happen here?
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.520]   We're all relaxed, everything's fine.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.360]   - Yeah.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   - And then they're standing off at a funny angle
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.320]   and before they know it, I've spun
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.760]   and my back is on their chest and they can't go anywhere.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   - Yeah.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.040]   How did you first develop that throw?
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.280]   So for people, it's called Ippon Seinagi,
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.840]   which means your right hand goes under their armpit area.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.360]   And that's like a vice that connects you to them.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.200]   - Yeah.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.840]   - And then they go on for the ride.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.680]   - Yep.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.880]   - The interesting thing with the standing one
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.680]   is as opposed to drop Seinagi version,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.160]   the drop Seinagi, you kind of drop under them.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.720]   And because there's a vice,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.440]   they're like pulled under and like over.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.400]   - Yeah.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.400]   - With the standing one,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.760]   I suppose there's some similar physics,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.400]   but you're kind of loading them onto your hip.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.440]   And so they're in the air while you're standing still.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.240]   There's a sense in which they're,
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.040]   like you're lifting them above where they started.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.880]   - Yes.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.240]   - That's how you get the really big air.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.080]   - Yeah.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.000]   - Obviously if everything is right.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.720]   So how did you first develop that?
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   How did you first?
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.960]   - I first learned just learning like the very basics
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.640]   of the throw, foot placement, all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.240]   And then like anything, the basics are nice.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.120]   But once you get good at the basics,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.920]   it's very easy to stop,
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   but it gives you a good like fundamental platform
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   to learn off of and to expand off of.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.800]   And then I expanded when I first started watching Koga,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.160]   the new wind, right?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.240]   'Cause he's the one that first like introduced
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.120]   that split hip style Seinagi that I do.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.280]   Once I learned that one,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.960]   I built about eight different variations of Seio
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.280]   off that one start position.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.640]   That way I could, regardless of your defense,
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.000]   I had an answer for a throw.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   - So why that one though?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.600]   Why, can you describe love to me, Travis Stevens?
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.280]   Why'd you fall in love with that throw in particular?
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.840]   - It was really a sense of,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.880]   you know, one of my shortcomings as a kid,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.440]   like I hate leg day in the gym.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.960]   I hate it with a passion.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.240]   If you ask me to do a squat, I'll get it done,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.000]   but I will bitch and moan every step of the way.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.840]   I hate it.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   I remember one time I was at the gym with my trainer
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.680]   and he goes, "Okay, we're gonna do front squats.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.480]   "And I want you to put 225 on the bar."
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.800]   And I was like, "I can't do that."
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.920]   And he was like, "What do you mean you can't do that?"
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.040]   And I go, "I physically, I can't do that."
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   And he was like, "Are you serious?"
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.240]   And I go, "Yeah."
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   So he didn't believe me.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.280]   We put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.920]   And then he was like, "Okay, let's go down to 185."
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.440]   And I was like, "I can't do that.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.240]   "I just, it's not happening."
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.840]   - You probably couldn't strength-wise, you just refused.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.760]   - I just mentally, I cannot wrap my head around like,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.800]   "This ain't happening, I'm not doing it."
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   So I ended up with like 95 pounds on the bar.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.920]   I got you at a front squat, no problem.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.960]   - By the way, body weight squats are rough too,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.320]   psychologically.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.440]   - Yeah, I just, when it comes to my legs,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.800]   like I want no part of like leg pressing,
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.120]   single leg squats, split squat, any of that,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.960]   I want no part of it.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.160]   - So you think like the more traditional variants
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.840]   of San Aki require you to-
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.440]   - Have that leg strength, that mass.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.120]   Like when you watch Japanese Judo players,
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   like their thighs and their hips, they're thick.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.080]   Like they got a lot of power there.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.680]   - So you're almost like always dropping a little bit
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.400]   into a squat position.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.440]   - For mine, never.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.760]   - No, no, no, not you, sorry.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.160]   - For them, yeah. - The traditional ones.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.000]   - Yeah.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.720]   And so the split hip,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.000]   the split hip actually allows me to keep my legs straight.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.480]   And the farther I split my legs,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.320]   the lower my center of gravity goes.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.800]   Now I don't need my legs.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.640]   - Yeah.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.440]   - Perfect, love it, let's do it.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   - So that's the way you were thinking about it, okay.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.640]   But it's, you know, the interesting thing about it
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.480]   is because, you know, as I mentioned to you,
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.360]   I've gotten to Judo after first watching you in the Olympics
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.680]   and then watching Koga as well.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   And so you start imitating the people you foresee
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   and then you take it to Judo coaches
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.640]   and they're like, no, no, no, no,
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.680]   that's the wrong way to do it.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.600]   And happens all the time, it drives me nuts, drives me nuts.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.920]   I was in Poland one time teaching a camp
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.480]   and I had two coaches anti-coaching,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.080]   telling their kids not to do Seoi the way I do it
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.280]   because it never works.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   - Yeah.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.000]   - It's crazy.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.520]   - How do you have the fortitude and the guts
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.120]   to just go on with a throw that's not traditional,
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   a variant that's not traditional?
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.080]   - If you think about it, you know,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.520]   from a very basic like root of it,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.200]   there's a philosophy and a mentality of Judo
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.360]   of how the throws work, right?
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.120]   There's a mechanical structure there of like,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.240]   this makes sense.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.000]   If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.320]   Nothing else matters,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.560]   as long as we follow those core principles.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.000]   - So in the early days,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.880]   even then you were able to think on your own.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.040]   - Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.720]   for my foot placement based on my opponent's height
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.840]   because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.720]   is you need your center of gravity below the others.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.360]   Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   because the shorter you are, the bigger the split
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.760]   because the lower I need to get.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.560]   The taller you are, the less of a split I need.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.600]   - Is there something you could say
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.200]   about fundamental principles of Judo?
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.160]   Is there, over all that time,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.760]   not 20, over 20 years that you've been doing Judo,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.040]   it's not approaching 30, is it?
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.520]   - Yeah, it's getting there.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.360]   - Okay.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.640]   - We're a couple of years away, but it's getting there.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.120]   - Is there some like principles that have emerged?
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.920]   Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.760]   below theirs.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.600]   - Yep.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.080]   - Is there another kind of, both on the gripping side,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.160]   the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.920]   - There's some that have withstood time.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.440]   You have to be able to get below their center of gravity
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.960]   'cause you have to be able to rotate them
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.720]   around their center of gravity.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.040]   And then the other one is,
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.200]   that was always a principle when I was growing up
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.360]   and I didn't change until later on in my career
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.080]   was you have to be able to pull.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.840]   You need to be able to pull to get them off balance.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.320]   But when you think about that statement as a whole,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.560]   it ended with, they have to be off balance.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.920]   I don't need to pull to get you off balance.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.040]   I just need you off balance.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.560]   And when you think about it that way,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   it allows you to open up the doors to,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.080]   what do I need to do to get you off balance?
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.360]   I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.720]   and you could put yourself
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.960]   in your own off balance state, right?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.200]   When you think about people who wrestle, right?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.480]   If I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward,
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.320]   which means you're off balance.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.400]   There's no pull, there's no push, there's no nothing.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.480]   I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.680]   and the door open for an attack.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.760]   - And that off balance could be very subtle.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.240]   - Could be very subtle.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.280]   And the better you get and the more skills you get,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.640]   the less subtle it is.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.920]   - So we should also mention
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.520]   that there is something called forward throws,
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.360]   where you throw the person,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.840]   they're gonna fly facing forward,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   they're gonna fly forward.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.080]   And then backward throw, they're gonna fly back.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.920]   - Yep.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.440]   And then there's lateral,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.680]   they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.840]   - Okay, so the forward throws,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.440]   there's the one we've been talking about,
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.840]   which is a Senagi,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.320]   and there's a bunch of different variants,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.280]   Ippon, Marote, Senagi.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.920]   There's drop and there's standing versions of them.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.560]   And that all, I don't know if there's a way to summarize it,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.160]   but that's like as clean as getting your center of gravity
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.800]   under theirs as it gets.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.120]   And then the rest is just gripping variations.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.960]   - Yep.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.160]   - I guess it's all gripping variations
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.320]   on all of these throws.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   And then there is, in terms of forward throws,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   there's the other big one in competition is Uchimata,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.120]   which is, I don't know, we can try to explain that one,
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.880]   but it ends up being where one,
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.240]   you're standing on just one of your feet,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.000]   and the other one is up in the air.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400]   And I don't know if you put in that same category,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.840]   Hara-Goshi, like those kinds of throws
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.920]   where you're kind of a little bit single-footed.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   - Yeah, so there's two-footed techniques
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.960]   and then there's single-footed.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.800]   - Single-footed, yeah.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.640]   Ogoshi, where it's like you're doing a mix
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.360]   between the Uchimata and the Seinagi.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.200]   - Yeah.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.080]   - It's a hug.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.480]   You hug a person and then you turn your hips around
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   such that you're now hugging facing the same direction.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.840]   - When it comes to forward throw,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.520]   there's, regardless of the name of the throw
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.760]   or the gripping variation that you're using,
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.080]   the whole principle is how do I get this person
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.960]   to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.600]   The more of a forward roll I can get,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.520]   the bigger the score.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.120]   If I get a quarter of a turn
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.280]   where you land on your side
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.080]   and you don't go over your back, it's a half score.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.280]   - But they all require me to get you
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.160]   to do that forward rolling action.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.760]   - So just if we think of one person,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.840]   if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.080]   and their back nicely rolls over the ground,
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.600]   you're trying to do the exact same thing
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.000]   with you connected to them.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.480]   - Well, and if it's nice and it's smooth,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.080]   it's probably not a full score.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.960]   It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.920]   Right, so if you think of a drop Seinagi,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.840]   if I'm moving too slow and you still roll
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.360]   over your shoulders and there's no direct impact,
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.840]   it's only a half score.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.680]   - Right.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.080]   - They want the force.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.040]   - The force, the violence is good.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   Okay, so then in terms of backward throws,
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.080]   the traditional ones,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.120]   there's stuff where you trip them from outside their body,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.720]   like Osotogari, it's a trip where you hook your leg
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.040]   onto their leg and you trip them,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.000]   but your hook goes outside of their legs.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.680]   And then there's the trips from inside their body.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.960]   There's one foot is called Kuchigari
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.720]   and then the other is Oshigari, doesn't matter.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   The most important thing is outside and inside.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.280]   And then there's like,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.920]   I don't even know how you throw them sideways
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.800]   except foot sweeps.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.120]   And then there's the foot sweeps where you can sweep
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.920]   one of their legs from out of them
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.180]   or both their legs at the same time.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.440]   And like we were talking about this kind of is
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.720]   when timed perfectly, it's effortless for everybody involved
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.040]   and the ending, like you said,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.000]   is big, dramatic and violent.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.560]   - Yeah.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.360]   - Is there other kind of, oh yeah.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.120]   There's a sacrifice techniques.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.560]   - Yep.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.000]   - There's a bunch of them and that ultimately
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.960]   the variations have to do with gripping,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.160]   but you're basically you, the attacker fall onto your back,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.000]   sticking your legs somewhere onto their body,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.720]   which is like this fulcrum over which they fly
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.640]   and do that same kind of role that you mentioned.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.960]   - You basically sacrifice your back to the mat
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.120]   in order to throw them into that circular pattern
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.640]   so they hit their back.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.080]   Sometimes we use a foot, sometimes we don't.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.560]   And so we should probably say,
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.480]   it's okay for you to go onto your back
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.280]   as long as you're clearly demonstrating control
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.120]   over the other person's body.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.040]   - Correct, you can't go to your back in the same direction
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.200]   that your opponent is trying to put you to your back.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.520]   You have to go the other way
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.000]   or you have to initiate you going to your own back.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.280]   - Right.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.360]   Like clearly.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.640]   And then there's all the counters
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.480]   which almost kind of have a whole group of their own,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.080]   even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.240]   it seems like they're their own whole thing.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.320]   - Yeah, but they follow the same principles.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.700]   It's just most counters.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.920]   Like if you wanted to counter an uchi mata, for example,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.560]   you're trying to throw me in a somersault
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.600]   over my right shoulder.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.420]   Therefore, I would counter you
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.800]   by throwing you over your left shoulder.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   It goes in the opposite shoulder direction,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.960]   but in the same somersault idea.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.400]   - And there used to be,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.320]   I already at this point forget the years,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.600]   but it might be before the 2012 Olympics,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.960]   where they banned,
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.320]   you used to be allowed to grab legs
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.480]   in the same way you do in wrestling.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.440]   So you have basically all the techniques
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.800]   you would have in wrestling available to you
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.680]   if you would like.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.920]   It's just that some of the techniques in wrestling
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   are not that effective for getting your opponent
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.800]   to their back.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.720]   Wrestlers wanna take the other person down
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.880]   in any way possible and have control.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.760]   Judo wants to take you down, like we said,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.400]   in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.760]   - Yeah, it has to be to the back.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.800]   A lot of wrestling takedowns happen
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.040]   because they get behind them and then they part their out.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   - Yeah, so, but judo banned all touching of the legs,
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.200]   which is very dramatic change at the sport.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.040]   - Right after 2012.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.960]   - It was after 2012?
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.120]   - In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.280]   and everything was free.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.920]   In 2012, we could only touch the legs
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   as a defensive action or in response to an attack.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.680]   So I could try to throw you with a normal throw.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   And then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.520]   - Right, so there-
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.200]   - Had to be a secondary technique.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   - And didn't they disqualify on a first offense?
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.320]   First offense was a direct disqualification,
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.920]   which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.520]   who won in 16.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.160]   She was DQ'd in I think the quarters.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.960]   And it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.200]   as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.000]   of the match had they not disqualified her.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.360]   - So that's not that dramatic.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.320]   And by the way, you say 57,
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.560]   that refers to weight divisions and that's in kilograms.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.760]   And kilograms is the measure of weight
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   that the rest of the world uses and the United States does not.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.280]   And there's, we should say the divisions for guys,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.080]   I don't know what the 70, I don't know what the lower level.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight,
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.160]   which has no ceiling.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.000]   - No ceiling.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.120]   - It's an important distinction.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.260]   - Yeah, it is an important distinction.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.680]   And you competed most of your career
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.600]   at 81 kilograms.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.440]   - All of it.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.120]   - You never did 73.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.640]   - I never did 73.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.840]   - But you had to cut big for 81 anyway,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.680]   especially big.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.720]   - Towards the end of my career, yeah.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560]   - Okay.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   - I overly grew into the division.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.520]   - What's, I'm trying to remember,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.640]   is it about 180 pounds?
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.720]   - 178.6, I think.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.240]   - And you have to weigh in with the gi.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   - No, nothing.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.880]   You're not allowed to wear anything
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   except for your underwear.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.720]   - That's right. - Weigh in.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.040]   - Confusing you just, that's right.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.920]   That's right, that's right.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.240]   That's which is very nice.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.760]   Okay, so we, would you say we covered
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.360]   most of the throws or no?
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.040]   So there's the forward and the backward,
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.720]   there's the sacrifice throws and the counters.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.560]   - Yeah.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.320]   - And then there's the leg grabs.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.680]   And we should say for the leg grabs
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.520]   that were effective, it's like the big pickups
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.920]   where you just kind of pick them up
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.160]   and try to figure out once they're in the air
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.560]   what the heck to do with their body
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.840]   to get them to the ground.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.760]   You just kind of figure it out as you go.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.480]   - I think the really nice one that was to me heartbreaking
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.320]   is the fantasy go is, I guess what's called
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.640]   a fireman's carry, which is, you know,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.920]   it does lead to judo-like beautiful throws.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.200]   And the fact that that was gone is that one
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.680]   I missed a little bit, but then a bunch of people,
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.640]   I guess, came up with the variance
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.800]   where you don't need to grab the leg.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.240]   - It's definitely not as effective
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.320]   as being able to grab it, but I'm also on the side
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.120]   of the fence having competed in all three.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.320]   It was definitely better for the sport
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.280]   to remove it as a whole.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   - It's probably good to cover sort of the whole spectrum
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.480]   of rules of judo is there's groundwork.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.200]   So there's, you do all this stuff on the feet
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.720]   where you're trying to murder each other
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.200]   with a giant throw, but then, you know,
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.120]   if the throw doesn't succeed, you go to the ground
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.320]   and you stay on the ground for some amount of time,
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.640]   like short amount of time, you have to move quickly.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.000]   You have to be attacking.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.480]   And two of the ways you can win is similar
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.240]   to people who do jiu-jitsu is you can submit them,
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.360]   chokes, arm breaks, all that kind of stuff, no foot locks.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   And you can also pin them, which is get around their legs.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.040]   And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.400]   You have to actually get around their legs
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.520]   and pin them in what in jiu-jitsu is called
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.480]   side control mount, all kinds of ways
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.320]   that doesn't involve their legs.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.640]   - Yeah, and then you pin them for like,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.360]   whatever, 20 seconds, 25 seconds.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.920]   - Yeah, 20 seconds now.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.720]   I think the distinction is their back
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.600]   has to be facing the mat.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.240]   You have to be past their legs
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.440]   and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.280]   - Yeah.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.200]   - So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top,
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.000]   but it has to be on the same plane.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.840]   - Yeah.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.080]   And all of this is, I think, different sports
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.300]   have different versions of this,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.640]   but it's like an approximation
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.080]   of what dominance looks like.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   - Yeah.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.320]   - So pin in wrestling is dominating your opponent.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.340]   Presumably, if you were in a street fight,
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.200]   that position allows you to then do a lot of damage.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.880]   Obviously, submissions is dominance
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.040]   'cause you're breaking their arm
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.520]   or choking them to unconscious.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.500]   And then obviously the throw,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.780]   which is not often talked about,
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.920]   but like if you talk about a street fight situation,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.680]   a throw is like the best way to murder somebody.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.400]   Like this could end anyone's life.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.380]   - Yes.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.840]   - It's terrifying, actually.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.420]   So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.100]   So going back to set of principles,
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.900]   you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs,
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.940]   which I think applies for type of,
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.620]   like the forward Senage throws.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.280]   Is there other stuff?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.020]   Also, you mentioned off-balance.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.760]   - Yep, there's the off-balance one,
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.360]   where you can either pull to get an off-balance
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.140]   or you can give way to the force,
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.080]   which can also lead to an off-balance.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.640]   You can amplify somebody's force.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.540]   So for example, if you push me,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.540]   you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.260]   But if you push me and I pull you,
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.860]   now you didn't expect that much force coming out of you.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.360]   Therefore, you're off-balance.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.580]   - The thing that's distinctly recognizable about judo
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.700]   is like when done at the highest level,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:59.680]   like it seems effortless when the big throw happens.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.520]   - Yeah.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.700]   - Like that's just, it doesn't,
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.560]   there is no other sport like it in the combat sports
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.740]   where it's like when the timing is right,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.280]   everything just is perfect.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.320]   I think you get that in MMA and boxing sometimes
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.960]   when there's a perfect strike.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.760]   Just like what they, but it's not just like a hard hit.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's like, it's almost like the,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.200]   with Conor McGregor and Aldo, for example,
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.600]   when you just catch him just right.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.560]   - Just right.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.400]   - And that--
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.520]   - He didn't look like he hit him that hard,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.360]   but he hit him just right.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.040]   - Yeah, and like you get to see this all the time in judo.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   It's fascinating.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.440]   And so the beginning part of that
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.400]   is because there's a jacket,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.880]   there's also this whole thing that you're master of,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.840]   which is like, which is gripping.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.680]   - Yeah.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.280]   - Is there something you can say about,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.920]   are there some fundamental principles of gripping
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.280]   that you can speak to?
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.240]   Like what the hell is gripping?
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.080]   - Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.640]   in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.800]   and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.960]   And it's a distinction because I can hold you
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.320]   in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive,
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.080]   but if you can take a purely defensive grip
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.320]   and then I can't be offensive, we are no longer gripping.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.640]   We are holding each other.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.640]   - Right.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.440]   - Right, so like that would be the act of being able to grip
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.000]   is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.440]   and I can play both offense and defense at the same time
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.000]   where you can only play defense.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.280]   - So Donahart talks about like jiu-jitsu that way,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.120]   and not that way,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.560]   maybe you can see if there's a distinction.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.440]   So you have a set of weapons,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.400]   the other person has a set of weapons.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.680]   You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.800]   and shut down the set of--
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.640]   - Weapons that they have.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.760]   - That they have.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.720]   Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.800]   - I do if we wanna include body positioning
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.760]   with our gripping.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.880]   - Okay.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.080]   - Because I can give you any grip you want
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.440]   and you still can't throw me
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.760]   'cause I can put myself in a position
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.360]   that nullifies your ability to use those grips
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.120]   in a successful way.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.200]   - And those, would you say the hips are critical to that
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.120]   or is it everything?
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.880]   - Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.560]   you know, the angle of your foot.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.400]   - Yeah.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.640]   - Yeah, where you lean.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.680]   - Wow, okay.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.960]   And so, and there's a bunch of places you can grip,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.800]   obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket,
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.960]   like there's a bunch of places you can grip
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.080]   that are interesting.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.300]   So you can grip on the collar,
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.000]   you can grip on the sleeves,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.920]   you can grip like the elbow joint.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.240]   And then you could do those badass,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   like Eastern European, Georgian,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.440]   over the back. - Grips over the back,
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.080]   over the opposite sides of the heads.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.080]   - The Koreans that grab on one side around the head
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.220]   with their hands together.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.060]   - Yeah.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.520]   There's something really nice about just those,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.360]   like, I mean, especially Georgians.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.680]   - Just throwing that hand, yeah.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.760]   - Just over the person and just,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.680]   if you're not actually gripping a belt or anything,
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.340]   you're gripping just the entirety of like,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.660]   as opposed to being all nice,
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.220]   I'm gonna grab this part of the jacket,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.460]   this part of the jacket.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.780]   You're just like taking the whole fucking jacket
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.900]   and just launching somebody.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.260]   - For those people that can't picture judo,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.100]   think about it in like,
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.300]   if you understood like what a boxing match looks like,
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.140]   and you thought about that as like traditional gripping,
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.980]   when you throw like a Russian grip over the back,
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.240]   that's more like a hockey fight.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.860]   Like I'm just grabbing you
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.060]   and we're just gonna be throwing punches left and right.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.640]   'Cause when we have that grip, somebody has to get thrown.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.480]   - Yeah.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.960]   - There's no, we don't walk around with this grip.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   It's go time once somebody throws it.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.100]   - To me as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner,
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.940]   there's two styles of Olympic level judo.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.580]   One is where you're trying not to get thrown.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.100]   And the other is where you're trying to throw.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.780]   More specifically, when you're trying not to get thrown,
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.180]   there's like the strategy that you're using gripping
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.180]   to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.980]   You're being very clever and strategic
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.420]   and all that maybe using conditioning.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.300]   And then there's people who just like step in the pocket
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.980]   and they almost don't care if they're getting thrown
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   'cause they have the confidence
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.600]   that they're gonna throw first.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   - Yeah.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.100]   - And those, like there's a clear distinction
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.340]   between the people that do one or the other.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.260]   And I think both can be done extremely successfully
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.460]   at the highest level.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.640]   It's just like, obviously you admire the people
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.380]   that step in the pocket.
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.380]   - And I think when you look at the people who do judo
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:49.260]   the best, like if we wanna talk about like the top 10%
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.060]   of the people who would compete at the games,
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.860]   they do both and they do both really well,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.160]   but they favor one.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.220]   Because if you look at a player like
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.180]   Lutep Attiliani of Georgia, for example,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.580]   there's a guy that stands in the pocket,
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.580]   but we can find numerous occasions
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.820]   where he's hustled some people
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.160]   for like a short period of time to get out of scenarios,
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.060]   to elongate the match, to make somebody tired.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.340]   So you want both sides of the coin,
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.500]   but you better pick the one that,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.020]   80% of your strategy is gonna be built around.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.500]   - Sorry for the romantic question,
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   but I talked to Dan Gable and he always looked
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.300]   to the Russians as the artists in wrestling.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.500]   And he always wanted to be an artist,
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.180]   but I think he's known for being that sort of guts,
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.100]   aggression, mental toughness guy,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.100]   but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.440]   It's hard to know when you just watch you
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.020]   'cause it looks like you're aggressive
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.340]   and you got the guts and the mental toughness,
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.700]   but there's also obviously a mastery of technique.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.460]   Which would you lean towards in terms of what accounts
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.180]   for your success and just the way you approach judo?
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.140]   Is it the guts, the aggression, the mental toughness,
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.020]   or is it the mastery of technique, the artistry?
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.580]   - Mine would be my aggressiveness
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.360]   if I'm gonna pick those two areas.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.060]   But I think there's a third area in there
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.200]   that I would put myself in where I'm more of a strategist.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.380]   I look at all of my opponents
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.860]   and all I ever see is their faults.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.920]   And the way I do judo is built around their faults.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.980]   And it's just, I put myself in scenarios
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   where I don't even know how I'm gonna win.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.820]   But what I've done in those scenarios is
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.480]   I've made it very difficult for you to win.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.260]   And then I figure out the rest as I go.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.180]   - Like how do you study an opponent?
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.940]   Are there bins you can put them in?
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.660]   Like there's a lefty and a righty or this kind of stuff.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.860]   How many bins are there in judo in your mind
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.900]   that you put your opponents in?
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.820]   - Yeah, there's probably about 20.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.460]   There's like certain players who you could put
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.420]   in a category of like, they're only good for the first,
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.740]   you know, two thirds of the match.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.860]   After that, they turn into a different player
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.420]   where they're either falling into a sense of panic
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.780]   or uncertainty.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.540]   And you can, if you were to take a video clip of,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.820]   let's say Church's Philly, right?
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.540]   They got George and I beat in the Olympic semi.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.100]   He's somebody that would beat you
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.880]   in the first three minutes.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.420]   And if you clipped out all of his matches
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.740]   and you only watched the first three minutes of every match,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.460]   you would see one style.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.940]   If you found all the matches where he got taken
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.940]   into the last minute and he wasn't winning by a major score,
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.220]   you would see a completely different fighter.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.420]   And so going into like my Olympic semi,
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.900]   I put him into that category of like,
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.700]   I want to get to this guy 'cause this guy is beatable.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.820]   The trick is how do you get there?
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.660]   - How do you get there?
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.620]   And by the way, we're talking about the 2016 Olympics
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.900]   where you won the silver medal.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.580]   You were part of three different Olympics.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.340]   But the cardio aspect of it,
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.780]   have you faced exhaustion often in your matches
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.180]   where you have to go deep and go like past?
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.940]   - Yeah, but that's not from the judo side of it.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.940]   That's from like, I did a very bad job of making weight.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.060]   - It's always the weight cut?
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.500]   - Yeah, it's always the weight cut.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:43.500]   And I think people really struggle with that.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.340]   They blame cardio and training and everything else.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.500]   But when it really comes down to it,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.860]   like we train for an hour and a half,
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.900]   two hours, twice a day.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.100]   How are you tired after five minutes?
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:54.940]   - Right.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.580]   - Right, it becomes into a mental struggle,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:01.060]   your anxiety, your stress, your lack of belief in yourself.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.660]   Or in my case, sometimes it's poor nutrition.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.700]   Sometimes I had one too many McDonald's meals.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.740]   It just, it happens.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.780]   - Okay, so let's talk about weight cutting real quick.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:16.740]   So I've seen weight cutting break
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.380]   some of the toughest fighters, wrestlers, grapplers ever,
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.040]   like burnout break,
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.180]   like where they makes you wanna quit the sport.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.820]   So this is what people don't often talk about,
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.980]   but mentally it's one of the hardest things,
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.820]   especially when you're doing it kind of wrong
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.000]   because it becomes a mental war.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.500]   So you competed, like you said,
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.240]   your whole career at 81 kilograms.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.640]   You walked around at?
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.220]   - 88, 89.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:49.220]   - So about 15 pounds, sometimes 20 pounds over that.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.500]   - Give or take.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.500]   - And so what was your process like mentally and physically?
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.180]   First of all, maybe you can comment on
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.940]   when the weigh-ins are relative to the matches.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.720]   And then what was your process like leading,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.580]   like a week ahead, a day ahead, an hour ahead,
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   minutes ahead of the weigh-in?
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.540]   - Man, everyone varies tremendously
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.260]   because we're not like most sports
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.540]   because you're dropped off in foreign countries
[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.740]   with who knows what, right?
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.660]   Some places have saunas, some places have treadmills.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.880]   I went to a place one time in China in the middle of winter
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.260]   where the roads were frozen with ice
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.980]   and we had to use our hotel rooms
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.900]   because you couldn't sweat outside 'cause it was too cold.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.580]   And every one of my Olympics, the weight cut was different
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.900]   just given my mass.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   When I went to 2008, I was probably like 82, 83 kilos
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.020]   walking around, so weight cutting wasn't a thing for me.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.140]   In London, we actually weighed in the morning of.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.340]   So weigh-ins were at like 6 a.m.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.980]   And the Olympics were always beneficial to me
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.220]   because they actually don't start until like 10 or 11.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.260]   So you actually were able to recover.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.060]   Where on the circuit, you would weigh in at 6 a.m.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.500]   and the competition started at 8 a.m.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.180]   It's like, well, I was cutting weight at 5 a.m.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.500]   - And most of it, for people who are not familiar,
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.340]   but maybe you can also correct me,
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.860]   most of it, you're really just getting the water
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.700]   out of your system.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.220]   It was water- - At that point, yeah.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.700]   - Like 24 hours before even?
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.860]   So are you- - Like an hour before.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.780]   - But yeah, but like leading up to it.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.140]   And have you eaten the day before?
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.580]   Do you try to minimize the amount of food in your system?
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.300]   - My weight cutting process was a little bit different
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.300]   than most people because I like to eat.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.020]   I'm not the type of person that believes
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.340]   your athletic career is determined by your nutrition.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.540]   - Right. - I don't believe that.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.900]   I think some sports are built that way,
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.860]   but when it comes to combat sports,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.140]   like your ability to knock somebody out
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.500]   has nothing to do with whether you had a cheeseburger
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.980]   or a salad.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.220]   My ability to throw you is not determined by that.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.820]   I may be able to perform better
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.380]   because I've eaten a certain way,
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.020]   but not enough to justify an entire diet change.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.580]   Your body is built and my body is built
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.100]   to operate with certain things
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.620]   that I've had in my system for years.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.780]   - Yeah, I think I'm with you,
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.180]   but I also believe that there's a mental aspect.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.540]   So if you're surrounded by people
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.460]   that tell you diet matters,
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.220]   then if your diet is off,
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.900]   you're gonna believe you're going to be off
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.980]   because the people around you
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.660]   tell you your diet should be good.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.060]   So yeah, I think it's the same,
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.140]   I've had an argument with Matthew Walker,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.060]   who's a sleep scientist about sleep.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.740]   And it's like, if you believe sleep is essential,
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:55.580]   it's essential to get eight hours of sleep
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.460]   every single night perfectly,
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.340]   then you're going to be very stressed
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.300]   when you don't get it.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.540]   And then I think you will negatively affect,
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.500]   the stress will negatively affect your longevity
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.540]   in all kinds of aspects of your life.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.380]   If you actually just learn to truly listen to your body,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.140]   become a scientist for your own body with sleep and food,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.180]   it might end up that it will be the eight hours a night
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.260]   or whatever, but it might be something else.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.940]   And probably diet, or I remember when I was meeting
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.700]   with the USOC nutritionist after London,
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.700]   it was probably around 2014, I think.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.140]   And when we had our team meeting
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.660]   at the beginning of the year and I was talking to him,
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.760]   he was talking about the nutrition plans
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.100]   that he could put us on.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.020]   And I was like, timeout, I've done the USOC thing,
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.380]   like I've done the couscous,
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.460]   I've done the lemon in my water, I go, I'm full of shit.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.580]   - The couscous?
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.900]   - Yeah. - The couscous?
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.740]   Oh boy.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.580]   - Like there was just,
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.580]   'cause there's like a cookie cutter plan, right?
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.260]   And I was like, look, here's what I want you to do.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.060]   I go, I'll listen to you, but you're gonna walk
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.940]   into the 7-Eleven across the street from the USOC.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.340]   And if you can't buy it in that 7-Eleven,
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.580]   it's not on my plan.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.500]   - Right.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.540]   - I go, because I go to places where the only thing
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.540]   I can eat is Pringles and a Snickers bar.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.380]   I've done that.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.360]   Like I've flown to Azerbaijan,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.340]   stayed in a hotel where the restaurant is closed,
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.900]   USA Judo hasn't paid for the meal plan.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.500]   And the only thing that's available
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.020]   is the thing across the street.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.460]   - So you were eating Pringles.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.940]   - Before fighting a grand slam event while cutting 20 pounds.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.380]   - And a Snickers bar.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.780]   - Yeah.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.860]   - I just, the visual of that, that's some like,
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.020]   that's some rocky shit.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:33.840]   Okay.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.220]   - Build me a nutrition plan, go for it.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.380]   'Cause I'm not paying my own way
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.400]   to travel with 14 days of food.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.280]   - Right.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.420]   I mean, that's one of the magic of your whole career
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.940]   and also Judo.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   I mean, I'm sorry to say, of course,
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.220]   you want athletes to be super rich
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.820]   and super well-funded from an athlete perspective
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.660]   and the sport to be popular and managed
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.780]   in an ultra competent way.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.860]   But as a fan-
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.860]   - That's not reality.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.740]   - But as a fan, it's fun to watch somebody like you
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.780]   who's exceptionally driven have to suffer
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.340]   in all of these different interesting ways.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:12.340]   - But it's only suffering if you expect the other side.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   I don't expect it.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.180]   I accept it for what it is,
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.140]   which is why I write off nutrition for athletes.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.540]   'Cause it can be done without it
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.820]   as long as, to what you said before,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.660]   like you don't believe you need it.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.780]   Some people believe they need it.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.340]   - Getting your mind right is the most important thing.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.500]   - You know what I believe I need?
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.340]   - What's that?
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.980]   - A Snickers bar when I'm tired.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.480]   I want a little bit of sugar, makes me feel better.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.820]   What do you want me to do?
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.060]   (laughing)
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.700]   - What are you gonna do?
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.660]   - Yeah, so I just love the visual
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.500]   of you eating a Snickers bar before-
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.940]   - But that's what became,
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.260]   but that became part of my nutrition plan.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.140]   When the USOC guy wrote my nutrition plan,
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:58.260]   I was eating a burrito bowl with brown rice,
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.300]   white meat chicken, black beans, guacamole, cheese,
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.040]   two chocolate chip cookies, and a Diet Coke.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.340]   - This is like Chipotle?
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.980]   - It was Boloco, but same concept.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.100]   - Same concept.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:10.940]   - Because it fed-
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.140]   - Two chocolate chip cookies.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.340]   - 'Cause I needed the sugar.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   I was 88 kilos when I stepped on the scale at 6.3% body fat.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:24.060]   Now I gotta make 81.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.140]   - Six, what, really?
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.020]   - Yeah, and the USOC was like,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:35.020]   "Hey, you can't fight 81 anymore, you have to fight 90s."
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.980]   And I go, "I'm already into the quad, I'm not changing."
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.940]   I go, "Build me a plan where I can do this,
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.500]   and now we have to have an acceptable weight cut.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.500]   Like, it's just, what do you want me to do?
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.020]   I'm not the IJF, I can't just change the fact
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.820]   that it takes two years to qualify.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.980]   I know where I'm at, I know what I have to go through,
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.060]   and I accept the consequences.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.220]   It is what it is, what do you want me to do?
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.900]   - All right, so what was the process?
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.780]   I mean, can you speak to,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.140]   so you wake up early in the morning,
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.580]   the day of the weigh-ins, a few hours before?
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.220]   - Technically, my weight cut never started
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.380]   until I got off a plane and to a hotel.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.100]   - And how many hours?
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.060]   - Three days.
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.700]   - So it's a three-day cut.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.540]   - It's a three-day cut.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.140]   - Mentally, you're thinking of it that way.
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.020]   - Yeah. - And then you're still eating.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.140]   - I eat every day.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.900]   - And then like, what, do you load up on water maybe
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.140]   as you start and then? - Nope.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.340]   - Or the water stops?
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.340]   - It is what it is.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:38.460]   - So you just, I mean, it's a slow,
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.100]   you're not actually like sweating all three days, are you?
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.920]   But then it's like torture to sleep.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.720]   - Part of the process.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.380]   - Are you able to sleep?
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.220]   - Sometimes.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   It depends.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.180]   - So you're dehydrated, further and further dehydrated
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.060]   with six, 7% body fat, trying to lose 10 pounds.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.940]   - I even developed a way to drink water out of a bottle
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.460]   where I don't drink anything, but I feel like I have.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.580]   - Swishing it, what's the?
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.660]   - No, so like I take like a bottle of water
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.580]   and like if we were to like to draw a line on it,
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.140]   I would tip it and I would go like this, I would go.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:25.300]   And you would draw that line, but like,
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.000]   I've drank now water for 20 seconds or whatever it is.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.260]   And I feel I get the fix. - And your brain was like,
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.100]   yeah.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.860]   - Brain told me I got there, no problem.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.980]   - That's amazing, man.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.020]   You just, your mind's a very powerful tool.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.500]   And the problem a lot of people have is
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.360]   they don't accept the reality of the situation.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.620]   They bitch about the reality of the situation.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.460]   I just.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.900]   - First of all, you could always quit, right?
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.740]   - Yep.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.980]   - So like you're not.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.740]   - Never missed weight, never.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.340]   - Never missed weight.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.940]   - You can perform poorly, you can't miss weight.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:05.780]   - Don't miss weight.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.140]   - Don't miss weight because you can always win
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.620]   regardless of how bad the weight cut is.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.660]   You can never win if you miss weight.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.220]   - But your brain is also really good.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:23.460]   Maybe not your brain, but I know my brain,
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.060]   I think most people's brains are good at generating,
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.660]   the more desperate things become,
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.540]   the better at generating excuses.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.820]   So what were you doing with your mind
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.620]   that resulted in you never missing weight?
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.060]   - The plan.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.580]   So like I said, like my weight cut would never start
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.540]   until I got to the hotel
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.740]   because I didn't check my weight the morning of,
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.820]   I didn't check my weight when I got there.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.860]   I just, while I'm traveling,
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.920]   I'm doing things at like a minimal level,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.820]   but I'm never not giving myself something I'm craving.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.820]   If I'm thirsty, I'm drinking a Diet Coke.
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.820]   If I'm hungry, I'm buying a Snickers bar,
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.560]   I'm buying a sandwich, I am.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.220]   And I accept the consequences when I get there.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.100]   And then when I get there,
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.060]   if I step on the scale and it says 88 kilos,
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.260]   I instantaneously know exactly
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.940]   what it's gonna take to be 81.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.820]   - And then you just follow like a robot,
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.460]   follow a very specific process.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.020]   - Yep.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.940]   - And then, I mean,
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.740]   'cause there's a lot of seconds in three days,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.700]   seconds and minutes,
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.780]   and you just,
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.540]   - I just know exactly what it takes from my body.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.780]   I know exactly what a one hour gym workout
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.080]   wearing a sauna suit is gonna take.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.540]   I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day one.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.020]   And I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day three
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.540]   because they're not the same.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.280]   So I can instantly look at a hotel,
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.740]   decide, is there a bathroom, sauna, gym,
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.420]   temperature of the gym,
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.900]   access to the gym and when it is,
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.060]   access to the judo mats, my training partners,
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.400]   the roads versus streetlights, the weather outside.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.500]   I can take a look at that environment and say,
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.060]   this is my weight, this is weigh-ins.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.740]   And instantaneously in my head,
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.260]   there's a plan to make weight.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.100]   - And you have a sense of how much sweat adds up
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.580]   to 10 pounds, how much sweat plus time.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:24.080]   - Yeah, and I make sure in my plan,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.380]   all of my meals and how much water I need in between
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.180]   is allocated to still make weight
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.940]   'cause you have to eat or drink during that time.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.740]   - Are you incorporating like mental exhaustion into this?
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.180]   - That doesn't exist.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.020]   - So it doesn't?
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.840]   - No, it doesn't.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.540]   - Do you like meditate or, like what did the thoughts come,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.580]   especially three days,
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.860]   we're not talking about four hours of suffering.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.700]   - I'll tell you this--
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.980]   - This has broken some of the toughest people in the world.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.640]   - The hardest weight cut I ever had, hardest one.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.700]   I fought Pan Am games in 2015 in Edmonton, Canada
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.060]   on a Wednesday and I won.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.620]   So I've made weight on Tuesday.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.340]   I fought on Wednesday where I had to weigh in 5%
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.020]   of my weight class, so 84 kilos.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.020]   On Wednesday, I was 84 kilos.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:19.020]   I got on a plane on that Wednesday night
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.300]   and landed Friday morning in Sochi.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.160]   Okay, so I've traveled now.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:32.300]   I got on the scale, all my bags got lost, everything.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.920]   So somehow I flew from there to here, no bags,
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.660]   and I threw all of my stuff in my bag.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.980]   I wore sandals, one pair of pants,
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.580]   and a T-shirt on the plane 'cause I was like,
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:47.940]   I'm just tired, I just fought,
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.460]   like I don't even wanna carry it, I don't care.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.900]   What are the odds that I get there and my bags are gone?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.380]   - Yeah, very low.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.960]   - Very low.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.700]   Sure enough, it's gone.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.580]   I get all the way to Sochi, I check into the hotel,
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.620]   there's one sauna.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.660]   Guess what?
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.540]   You have to reserve it, and you're only allowed
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.540]   to reserve it for an X period of time.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.380]   - Guess, get a small tangent.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.060]   When you found out your bags are gone,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.260]   this is something I'll often think about.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.140]   There's like people that are helping you, right?
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.360]   Like there's a person at the airport who goes.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.740]   - Yep, oops, just like that.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.160]   - And then the person at the hotel who tells you
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.460]   that you have to reserve the sauna and looks at you
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:30.860]   like they don't care that you've been suffering.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.780]   - Nope, they don't even understand why you need it.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.900]   - Yeah, like why?
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.860]   Oh, you know, oh, this little kid reserved it
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:41.540]   for five hours or something to block it off.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.100]   Is there a frustration that gets in there?
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.980]   Are you-- - You just accept reality.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.640]   Don't even hinder on like the things you can't change.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.320]   'Cause the second you get frustrated,
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.780]   the second you think you can change it,
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.260]   you'll harp on it and that breaks most men.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.180]   - Yeah.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:02.500]   - That like little thing in the back of their mind thinking,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.540]   oh, like what if, there's no what if,
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.820]   like there's only right here, right now.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.940]   If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.100]   Let's just quickly come up with a solution
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.060]   to fix the problem.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.380]   - By the way, as another small tangent,
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:16.300]   all the greatest people I've interacted with
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   at the highest level think like that.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.460]   They don't linger on the, it's like the next thing.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.300]   - Yeah.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.420]   - Because like if you wanna do something great,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.300]   hard stuff is gonna keep happening to you.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.460]   And if you're gonna let that affect you,
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.100]   you're not ever gonna do the great thing.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.700]   - Yeah. - It's fascinating actually.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.540]   Like that's the one skill you have to learn.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.060]   Elon Musk is great at this,
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.820]   constantly dealing with emergencies.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.180]   Okay, this happened, what's the next step?
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.260]   - Yeah.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.100]   Accept.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:44.920]   - It's not that big of a deal.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.100]   Every problem has a solution.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.020]   - Yeah.
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.740]   - And if I can't solve it, it's not my problem.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.460]   So what, so--
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.300]   - How'd you figure it out?
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.140]   - In sandals.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.340]   - Get this, I get to the hotel.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.180]   - Yeah.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.000]   - I check in.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.700]   I don't even know about the sauna yet.
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.260]   I go, I need to find a clothing store.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.260]   I'm in the middle of Russia.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.260]   I open up Google Maps and I'm like, sports store.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.460]   I find an Adidas sports store
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.380]   in the middle of Sochi, Russia, right?
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:18.180]   I spend like $500 on like average sweats,
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.980]   no plastics, no nothing, and no running shoes
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.900]   'cause they don't have any.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.420]   - What's the temperature outside?
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.380]   Is it cold?
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.020]   - It was kind of like springish,
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.260]   so it wasn't cold, but it wasn't hot.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.680]   - Yeah, so you still need a lot of layers, preferably.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.660]   - You would need a lot of layers just to cut
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.820]   the amount of weight I'm about to tell you I have to cut
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.180]   because after I bought that stuff that next morning,
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.500]   and mind you, it's a Friday.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.860]   It's a Friday morning.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:47.580]   I go to the venue where we have the mats open to train
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:49.480]   and I step on the scale.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.500]   And then Sagan Batar of Mongolia goes,
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.980]   oh, pretty good, you're almost there.
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:59.220]   And I go, no, I'm not.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.580]   I stepped on the scale at almost 94 kilos.
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:05.780]   And I looked at him and I was like, I'm 81.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.780]   And he went, good luck.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.820]   - You're almost there.
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.780]   - Yeah, for the next weight class above.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.580]   - This is on a Saturday.
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.420]   - Friday morning.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.260]   - No, no, no, sorry.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.780]   Friday morning, the competition is when?
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:23.620]   - Sunday.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.440]   - Sunday.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.740]   - I weigh in Sunday.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.580]   - Okay.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.020]   - And I'm like, holy crap.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.700]   I throw on all my layers and there's one other person
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:35.100]   with me there, Kalita, who was my girlfriend at the time,
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.020]   now my wife, we start doing Judo.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.780]   'Cause I'm like, this will be the easiest way to knock off
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.940]   like three or four kilos.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.780]   Well, it's cold, I have no gi,
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:48.660]   and I'm working out with a female.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.460]   I can't get like overly physical
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.060]   to like really get my muscles going
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.260]   to really break that sweat
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.620]   because she has to compete in a day or two.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.180]   She's not a training partner.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.900]   You can't just use this person.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.320]   I stepped on the scale, I was 91 kilos.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.980]   So I went, well, I was a nice den, but like--
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.820]   - Have to work out.
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.640]   - Yeah, I go, that's not gonna fly.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.020]   So sure enough, the clothes are now ruined.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.980]   They didn't help me lose any extra weight.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.740]   So I go back to the hotel and I start reserving the sauna.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.540]   Do you know how hard it is to lose that much weight
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.180]   in a sauna by yourself?
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.720]   - So it's hard on many levels,
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.280]   but one of them is just mental.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.340]   - Yeah.
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.900]   - You're sitting in heat.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.360]   - Heat, and you're not doing anything.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.900]   Like if there had been a bike
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.540]   or like the sauna was big enough to use a jump rope
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.860]   or you could do some sort of activity,
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:44.340]   but you just sit and you stew and you're there mentally.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.900]   At one point during the weight cut,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.900]   I actually had my mouth on the bottom part of the door
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   where there was a little gap and my legs up on the benches
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.920]   and Kalita holding the door so that it didn't open
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.160]   so I couldn't open it,
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.340]   so that I could lean against that thing and have fresh air.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.540]   'Cause I was like, I was struggling.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.580]   - And we're talking about, I mean, how many hours is that?
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.040]   - Hours, and then the thing is,
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.380]   is because you have to reserve the sauna,
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.340]   I can't even take like a 30 minute break
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.180]   because the sauna is not gonna be mine in an hour,
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.200]   which means you have to use the sauna and the heat
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.220]   for that allotted time period.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.280]   And I hate saunas.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.540]   That is always my last resort.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.300]   I would use a bath, I will train, I will run,
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.740]   I will jump rope.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:32.820]   Sauna is like, oh, let me do that for 10 minutes
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.900]   after all of my gym workouts,
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.860]   just to keep the sweat going while I stretch and cool down.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.220]   That's never like the, hey, I'm gonna do five,
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.500]   10 minute sessions because I need to lose two kilos.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.900]   That is never the plan.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.740]   - Yeah.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:51.060]   But I mean, so I've done plenty of sauna for weight cuts
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.100]   to know, I can't even imagine what you went through.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:54.940]   - Yeah.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.980]   - The second slow down,
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.660]   that's one way to achieve immortality,
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.100]   is like the time slows down to like a stop
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.540]   and you're left alone with your thoughts.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.500]   You can't do anything, just like you said, you can't.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.180]   - There's nothing worse than sitting in that kind of heat
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.220]   for 10, 15 minutes.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.060]   - Yeah.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.260]   - And then you walk out and you're not even sweating.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.100]   - Yeah.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.140]   - There's nothing worse than that.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.460]   - And if you like, and maybe if you weigh yourself,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.860]   which you probably shouldn't be doing
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.780]   'cause it'll break you.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:22.620]   - Yep.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.500]   - You haven't lost anything.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.340]   - Yep.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.900]   And I was weighing myself every time
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.420]   'cause I only get breaks when I was hitting weight allotments
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.300]   and so if I could lose 0.3 in 10 minutes,
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.660]   I'd give myself a break, but I had to hit certain numbers
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.300]   'cause I only have the sauna for a certain amount of time.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.540]   And I remember one time I went downstairs
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.220]   to get my key to the sauna and the Japanese team
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.980]   had reserved it and took it from me
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.340]   because the guy didn't put my name on the list
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.100]   when I called down to get the sauna.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.100]   So I lost an entire session that I had to get made up
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.540]   towards the later part of the day
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.900]   'cause I still had no running shoes.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.380]   And then sure enough, my bags show up 30 minutes
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.280]   after weigh-ins.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.980]   Great.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.460]   - That's like the universe is kind of giving you
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.580]   a little wink there.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.420]   - Yep.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:15.060]   - I think like, 'cause so few people do this weight cut
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.340]   at this high of a level, people don't often realize
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.020]   'cause people get a sense of how hard it is
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.060]   to run 200 miles in a desert.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.580]   'Cause they go outside here in Texas,
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.620]   you can run five miles, oh, it's hard.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.160]   But like the weight cut is really,
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.980]   so you just, like, how did you do it?
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   Just fucking not refusing to-
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   - You have to make weight.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.460]   - You have to make weight.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:47.660]   - I am astounded when I hear like UFC fighters,
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.620]   like miss weight, right?
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.220]   Like when Jaden Cox missed weight at the Olympic trials,
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.940]   I was like, at least his was understandable
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.020]   because he missed the actual weigh-ins.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.820]   He wasn't like not on weight.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.660]   But when UFC fighters like miss weight,
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.400]   I'm like, how did that happen?
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.520]   You clearly like gave up a long time ago.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.980]   There were times where I was like, I can't do this.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.820]   There've been times where I've been in a sauna suit
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.280]   wrestling with a training partner who's probably 60 kilos
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.380]   who fought earlier that day to lose 0.3.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.420]   - To lose 0.3.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.820]   Are you considering your mortality in this moment?
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.420]   Like, aren't you thinking you're gonna die?
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.360]   'Cause like it's severe dehydration.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.980]   You could damage your body.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.680]   Are you thinking about any of this or is this just?
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.780]   Man.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.620]   Okay, yes.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.460]   - But see, I'm on the other level too
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.140]   where like I've been in Belgium, right?
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.840]   Belgium, there used to be a B-level tournament
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.860]   and the tournament used to go on.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.940]   And because I was always on the heavier side,
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.540]   like 81's fights on the second day,
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.980]   which is the heavyweight day,
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.980]   weigh-ins were always at like,
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.620]   let's say 2 p.m. the day before for that tournament.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.180]   Well, there was a sauna at the tournament.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.660]   I remember like being in the sauna and like,
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.820]   oh, I'm 80.9 kilos.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.780]   Weigh-ins aren't for three hours.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.280]   Fuck it, I'm gonna have lunch.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.780]   'Cause I mentally understand that what I eat right now
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.940]   is gonna fuel me for tomorrow.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.620]   So I don't wanna skip it.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.720]   I have the time to put it into my system and still lose it.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.180]   - It's almost like a computer program.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.020]   You're running through the process.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.220]   I get it, but like that all relies
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.540]   on your ability to be, to get it back off.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.060]   - Yeah, I mean, but also just like go through this process,
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.900]   which is painful.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.100]   It's like those monks who meditate
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.420]   while sitting in a fire kind of thing or something.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:02.500]   - Right, like that, yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.620]   Is there other people that are critical to this
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.460]   or is this all internal to you?
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.860]   Are there people that, you know--
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.220]   - Everybody has their own way of doing it.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.980]   Some people don't cut that much.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.340]   Some people can't weight cut at all, right?
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.580]   They would rather have been like 83 kilos fighting 90
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:26.340]   than be 83 kilos fighting 81.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.020]   (sighs)
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.900]   - So why did you never move up to 90?
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.820]   What's your sense?
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.500]   Is it from your deep understanding of your own judo
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.620]   and like the judo opponents you would face at 90 and 81?
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.040]   'Cause 81 is probably the hardest,
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.860]   if not the second hardest division in the history of judo
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:49.140]   compared to 73 and 81.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.260]   - You know, when I was a kid,
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.020]   like I always wanted to be like
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.660]   the middleweight Olympic champion,
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.340]   like the 81 kilo Olympic champion.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.260]   When I was in high school,
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.020]   I made a decision when I was trying to make weight for 73.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.300]   I was like, dude, this is,
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.900]   I was cutting weight for 73
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.060]   like I was cutting weight at the end of my career, right?
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.620]   And I was like, I'm just gonna bag it.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.740]   I'm gonna accept the fact
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.340]   that I may not make a junior world team.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:18.100]   I may not make this team, but I'll grow into the division.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.580]   So when I'm a senior player, like I'm ready to go
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.780]   and I'll naturally be stronger.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.140]   There's an understanding of like a growth process
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.300]   when you move up a weight class.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.660]   Most people can't just, oh, I'm gonna fight 90s
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.980]   and I'm gonna win because I won in 81.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.860]   The style of judo is different.
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.380]   How you move is different.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.820]   How they do things is different.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:42.100]   There's like a learning curve that goes into it.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.300]   And because the weight cut didn't really happen
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.620]   until I was getting ready for Rio,
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.940]   I wasn't about to have my last Olympic games
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.140]   be at a different weight class
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.940]   that I may or may not be able to grow into.
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.980]   - I mean, this is an awesome story of you kind of decided
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.900]   that this will be your life's work
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.620]   in terms of judo competitor is like the 81 division.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.780]   I'm going to, I mean, I don't know if you saw it that way,
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.740]   but you're talking about three Olympics.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.460]   And it's like this story of, I would say,
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   tragedy and triumph of just wars and 81 kilograms
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.700]   with the usual cast of characters of the top five
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.020]   in the world kind of thing.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.580]   So you just became a scholar of that,
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.060]   let your body grow into it and then let your body outgrow it
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.740]   and still suffer through it to keep it in the 81 kilograms.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.980]   You never competed at like at the highest levels at 90.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.020]   - I entered one tournament at 90 kilos.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:43.020]   And that was because before Rio from 20,
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:48.340]   from the end of 2014, all the way up until Rio's,
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.960]   every time I fought, I got hurt, every time.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.140]   There was no time where I made weight and got injured
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.320]   because my body weight was so high.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.260]   My body fat was so low that by the time I dehydrated enough
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.460]   to get down there and you take the physicality of judo
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.060]   and throw that into the mix, something broke every time.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.160]   It was like nature of the beast.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.900]   So the plan was before Rio,
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.580]   we made an agreement with USA Judo that,
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.020]   "Travis, you're gonna fight 90 kilos,
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.780]   but you're not gonna weigh in at 90 kilos.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:27.140]   Like, hey, there's no like you get to be 94 kilos
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.140]   and cut to 90s.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.980]   There's like, you're gonna step on the scale at 84 kilos,
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.960]   like a little bit of a weight cut, but not a full one,
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.220]   just so that you feel like you get into like the tournament.
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.380]   Because when I, around 2012,
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.540]   when I was talking with the USOC nutritionist,
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.220]   I actually got my weight down so much
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.380]   that I didn't really need to cut weight.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.820]   The problem is, is I wasn't cutting weight.
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.460]   I didn't feel like I was competing.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.300]   - Got it.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.220]   - Right, you have to go through like that mental process.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.660]   And I never really reworked that.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.460]   It was easier to just cut the weight and be ready to go.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.020]   But when I entered into the 90 kilo division,
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.260]   I was rushed to the hospital the night after
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.220]   because my body broke out in hives, like full body.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.340]   - My.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.020]   - They said it was stress induced.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.540]   - Fascinating.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.540]   - So a month before the games, I was hospitalized and hungry
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:21.860]   and filled with steroids to get the hives to drop.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.620]   And every couple of days, my body, when I got back home,
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.340]   I would end up in the hospital
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.100]   because my whole body would break out again.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.140]   - I wonder if it's like deviating from the process
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.260]   that you saw like perfectly crafted already.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.780]   - Or it was stress from my mind thinking,
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.740]   like even though it's not top of mind,
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.340]   there's probably a portion of me that like,
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.040]   the Olympics is coming around and it could be my last.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   That like my body just reacted to something chemically.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.920]   So I was breaking out in hives.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.760]   I actually bought like a 600 Euro Hugo boss suit
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.160]   because when I was in the Netherlands training at the time,
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.840]   I thought I had bedbugs
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.720]   'cause I was getting bit everywhere.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.680]   Then I thought there was something in the detergent
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.600]   at the local thing, so I threw away all my clothes.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.320]   Like I was paying for showers
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.760]   'cause I was trying to get the detergent off my body
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.600]   and buying new clothes at the airport.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.160]   - Trying to figure it out.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.120]   - Trying to figure it out and just go, yeah.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.240]   Accepting the situation.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.320]   I mean, but the level of stress is exceptionally high here.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.600]   Can we talk about the other side?
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.760]   People are gonna love this,
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   but you have a long history of persevering through injuries,
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.680]   through insane amounts of injuries.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.080]   - My ability to tolerate pain
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.780]   is probably more than most people.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.760]   - But see, injuries aren't just pain, right?
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.200]   It's like, it's also mental, like psychological.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.280]   Like again, like the weight cut,
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.080]   it can make a lot of people quit.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.440]   - Yep.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.920]   - Can you tell your history of injuries?
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.660]   What are the biggest injuries,
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.560]   the toughest injuries in your career?
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.480]   Starting from what, your early teens?
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.840]   - My early teens, I actually got out of sports
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   from 11 to, I wanna say like 15 years old, 16 years old,
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.760]   because a kid shot a double leg through my kneecap
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.120]   and I partially tore all the ligaments in my knee,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.640]   cartilage, meniscus, the whole nine yards.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.360]   And I had to learn how to walk again.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.480]   I spent two years in a leg brace, crutches,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.120]   you know, hobbling around the schoolyard.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.400]   That one was a challenge to come back from.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.200]   I've broken most of my ribs.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.120]   I won nationals with nine broken ribs.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.560]   I was actually getting Novocaine shots into my chest
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.520]   to avoid feeling the pain and then wrapping them
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.240]   to try to make sure I didn't pop a lung.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.000]   I've broken my collarbone.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.440]   I have five herniated disc in my neck.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.760]   I fractured my back twice.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.320]   I've broken my tailbone.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.840]   I tore my SI joints.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.180]   I've torn my right hamstring twice, my left one once.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   I've broken my ankles a few times.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.540]   I spun it once in a 360 that had depth surgery.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.180]   Fingers, toes, elbows, shoulders.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.540]   - So all of these are, first of all,
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:28.660]   you're a tough dude, man.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:32.760]   So each of those have a story behind them.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.420]   So if you're talking about the collarbone or the ankles,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:43.180]   or the back, the neck, is there interesting stories here
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.780]   that are behind these injuries?
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   Hard training, hard competing, jiu-jitsu, judo.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.820]   So ground stuff like sparring in the dojo
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.560]   or like drilling or all that kind of stuff.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.260]   If you were to sort of break it down,
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.540]   your understanding of the landscape of injuries
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.060]   you went through.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.060]   - I've never had one in jiu-jitsu, ever.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.940]   I mean, I might've like torn a fingernail
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.880]   or like gotten key burned,
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.840]   but I've never been like seriously injured.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.640]   I know when Ponza straight ankle locked me at Copa Podio,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.700]   that hurt, but I wasn't injured.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.540]   Like it felt sore, but like if I had to run,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.780]   like I could run.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.180]   - I can now understand probably exactly
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.000]   where the injuries came from then.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.400]   You're very quickly excelled at jiu-jitsu.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.020]   You have achieved another level in judo.
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.880]   And I think that means the intensity
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.260]   with which you approach judo
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.980]   to achieve that world-class level
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:49.300]   probably is the source of the injuries.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.580]   - Yeah, because the mentality
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:57.140]   of how I approach judo versus jiu-jitsu,
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.140]   jiu-jitsu to me is like a game that like we would play.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.740]   Like if you wanted to like grab a basketball
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.540]   and like go play a game of one-on-one,
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.060]   that's like jiu-jitsu to me.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:13.700]   Like I can't take the sport in its entirety seriously
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.700]   'cause I feel like the community of jiu-jitsu
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.340]   doesn't take it seriously.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.220]   - So just for people who don't know,
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.380]   just to set some context,
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.100]   you're a black belt in jiu-jitsu,
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.640]   but more importantly,
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.980]   you've beaten a lot of world-class jiu-jitsu people.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.420]   You've done very well
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.060]   at the highest levels of competition.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.500]   - Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say I've beaten them
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:39.140]   as much as I've trained with them.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:43.060]   And they understand whoever it is
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.580]   that through training with me,
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.720]   that like I'm not just a judo guy.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.100]   Like I know how to do jiu-jitsu, right?
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.740]   And if any one of them were to come to me and like say,
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.860]   hey, you know, I wanna feel what it feels like
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   to do judo with me,
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:07.840]   they would quickly understand that like
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.780]   the way I approach one is very different
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.060]   than the way I approach the other.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.220]   Like we probably wouldn't be friends
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.020]   if they did judo with me versus
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.500]   if they did jiu-jitsu with me.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   - I'm curious asking for a friend
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.940]   because mostly because I'll do a little judo with you today.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.660]   So you clearly, 'cause you're a great instructor and teacher,
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.580]   you have a mode where you can demonstrate a technique.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   Do you know how to like spar where you're going like 50%?
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.100]   - It's hard to put like a percentage to it
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.100]   because I've never in all of my jiu-jitsu ever gone 100%.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.540]   - In jiu-jitsu?
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.580]   - Yeah, like I had a conversation with Salo one time
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.240]   where we were talking about like jiu-jitsu and training.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.660]   And I was like, well, if I got his arm,
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.540]   I would just break it.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.300]   And he was like, but what if he tapped?
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.780]   I go, that's not my responsibility.
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.820]   If he taps and the ref doesn't say anything,
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.380]   you just break it, you just keep going.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.980]   He goes, but the tap means it's over.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.340]   And I said, no, the ref tells me when it's over.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.400]   I go, I never give you the opportunity to tap
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.380]   'cause if you have the opportunity to tap,
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.340]   that means you had the opportunity to think
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.260]   about how to get out, make a decision that you can't,
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.260]   then tap.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.420]   I clearly operated too slowly.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.260]   - Yeah.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.700]   - So there's a, it's either broken or I don't have it.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:33.220]   - You're a terrifying person to go against in Judo.
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.580]   Like the, on the ground, like everything you did,
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.840]   that's amazing.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.060]   That's really amazing.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.020]   That's what made you a really fun person to watch
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.100]   is you really went to war with these people.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.020]   - Yeah.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.580]   - So you know what it's like to go 100% in Judo?
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.700]   - I do, 'cause I know what it's like to train
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.300]   with somebody under the mentality of,
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.500]   I'm gonna do everything I want to do.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.180]   You're gonna do nothing you want to do
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.620]   and you're gonna accept that.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.260]   - Do you ever train in Judo
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.380]   where you let people get stuff?
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.460]   - Of course, all the time.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.900]   - Now or like?
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900]   - Always.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.940]   - Even when you're sort of building up the four years,
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.100]   building up to the Olympics, like there's smaller guys
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.380]   that are throwing you in the gym and that kind of stuff.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.580]   - No, I never said that.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.420]   - Okay.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.860]   (laughing)
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.520]   - That never came out of my mouth.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.720]   I said I let people do stuff.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.920]   I never said smaller people throw me.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.480]   - Oh, you mean you let them get a grip
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.280]   but then you'll position yourself on such a way
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.800]   that it's hopeless.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.760]   - The number one skill set that Judo is gonna teach you
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.680]   is the ability to give people false hope.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.840]   Right, 'cause I can let--
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.240]   - I'm really looking forward to the video
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.720]   we're gonna shoot later today.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.640]   - Like I can let you take a grip.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.880]   I can let you think that there's opportunity
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.800]   but what you don't understand is by the position
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.760]   and angle that I'm in, it's actually false hope.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.160]   As long as you don't know that it is,
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.880]   then now I'm free to operate and do what I want.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.520]   - See, I competed in Judo against black belts
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.000]   where I would go in and it looks like I should be able
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.360]   to throw them and then you just hit a wall.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.000]   And then I also saw you destroy those black belts.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.900]   So there's levels to this.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.400]   It's the cliche thing of there's black belts
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.920]   and there's black belts.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.160]   You're unique in this.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.440]   There may be a couple other Judo in America
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.680]   but you're really like unique.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.600]   I then get to see people that really I felt like
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.880]   were 10X better than me.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.360]   It just feels like that sometimes.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.240]   I've learned that madness and it said to be true
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.000]   that it might only be just a little better
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.720]   but I saw you destroy them.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.280]   And it was like, holy shit.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.140]   There's a thing in Judo where,
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:56.360]   imagine you as just an adult.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.820]   And I hope people can conceptualize this
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.660]   when they hear this.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.940]   But imagine you're a full grown adult,
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.220]   even male, female, it doesn't matter.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.580]   But there's a little kid in front of you,
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:12.220]   call him five or six years old and he's acting out.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.780]   Do you think you have the physical capability
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.380]   of with one hand grabbing that person or that kid
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.140]   and making sure that they freeze?
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.540]   They feel like they're nervous
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.000]   and they can't do anything.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.420]   When you fight a good Judo player,
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.260]   when they grab you, that's what it feels like as an adult.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.780]   Even I've felt that from certain players in Japan,
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.740]   when they get a grip, I'm like,
[01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.580]   I've now lost the function of this limb.
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.220]   - That's a really good way to put it.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.340]   - I think I could potentially beat some of the people
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:50.540]   I've went against, but certain grips they took,
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.860]   it made me feel powerless.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.140]   I was like, I didn't know this was possible.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.900]   That kind of power was possible.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.260]   - And you don't even know where it originates from.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.700]   'Cause you're like, how does one person's hand do this
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.940]   where I can't use my whole arm?
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.860]   Or like, I can't pick up my right foot
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:09.300]   because he's holding onto my right sleeve.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.140]   - It was kind of on a basic animalistic sense,
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.420]   kind of terrifying.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:20.340]   Part of this is like ego,
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.900]   but you realize that there's a food chain
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.540]   and you're not at the top of it.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:28.060]   That's part of the humbling process,
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.300]   I think, of martial arts.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:35.220]   I think everybody, like a lot of people,
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:37.100]   think they're much higher in the food chain
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.580]   than they really are.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.900]   And then when you realize,
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.980]   this is why it's a really healthy process for people.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:45.140]   Although they're not even competing in the Olympics,
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.340]   to practice martial arts.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.580]   'Cause you realize, okay,
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.860]   that putting yourself more accurately in the food chain
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:54.500]   is really good way to sort of place yourself
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.580]   in the rest of the world.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.620]   It humbles you to the reality of the harshness of the world.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.700]   - Yeah.
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.780]   It's kind of like when people look at survival
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.020]   in the wilderness, it's like, oh, it's not that hard.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:07.580]   No, you'd probably be dying in a couple of days.
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.020]   Same thing with like Judo and martial arts.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.180]   Yeah, it's really not that hard,
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.420]   but you don't know what to do yet.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.140]   And so when you find out that first time
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.940]   that you don't know what to do,
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.120]   it's devastating to a lot of people.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:24.740]   But those that stick through it and start to learn,
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.380]   it's a very powerful feeling
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.900]   that now you can take care of yourself.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:34.780]   - And I think when I talked to you a few times before,
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.740]   you talked about that there's the top three,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:38.900]   the top five in the world.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.300]   I don't know where you put them,
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.540]   but they're another level above everybody else.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.020]   - They're a whole nother tier, yeah.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:48.600]   - And the fact that you're, I mean, it's so exciting to me,
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:54.100]   probably because I just felt all the levels here
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:59.100]   and I have seen you and others at that height destroy those.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:03.780]   I've seen the exponential levels to this game.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:08.260]   It's incredible that you didn't quit,
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.540]   didn't doubt yourself and just persevered
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.980]   through three Olympics to get to that highest,
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.060]   always fighting at that very highest of levels,
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.140]   but just from the top 10 to the top five,
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.860]   really breaking in through that.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.660]   I don't know.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:30.860]   What would you say it took to get to that highest of levels?
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.220]   Like when you look back at all the weight cuts,
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.260]   just the insane amount of injuries,
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.100]   believe it or not,
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:41.020]   I didn't really think I was there until 2013.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.860]   I thought I was recognized as one of the best
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.020]   because I was able to fight for Oppensburg,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.620]   which was the professional Bundesliga team for Germany,
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.960]   which is one of the top clubs in all of Europe.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.020]   When they asked me to,
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.380]   I felt like Europe had like accepted me as like,
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.480]   oh, I'm a top level judo player.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.460]   But I don't necessarily think that when I signed on
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:08.140]   to compete for them that the division
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.180]   or the world of judo saw me as a top level judo player.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:18.420]   There's a mental shift that happens along that point.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:23.500]   And for me, my mental shift really came into play
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.020]   in December of 2015 before Rio.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.900]   That was like when I lost in Japan,
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.540]   that's when I realized like the world respects my abilities
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.040]   and they compete against them.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.900]   They don't compete against me as a person.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.900]   They compete against the idea or the persona
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:52.060]   that I've been able to establish
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.220]   over the years of competing in the division.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.180]   - Wow, so you're the,
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.780]   they probably have a nickname for you,
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.140]   you're the system of ideas and thought that they study.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.620]   - But they're studying me as a conceptual whole,
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.940]   not me as the human.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:12.860]   - Is your style relatively unique
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.700]   in the 81 kilogram division?
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.580]   - It was relatively unique for Kayla, I, and Jimmy
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.860]   up until 2016.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:25.460]   Now, since 2016, you can see a lot of what we used to do
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.820]   throughout most of Europe and even Asia.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.660]   Like you're starting to see some of those techniques
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.720]   that you didn't see before starting to get implemented.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.980]   'Cause when I was gearing up for 2015,
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.900]   I had such a slew of injuries that entire calendar year
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:46.420]   that I never should have made it to Rio.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.500]   I should have called it quits at the end of 2015
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:54.140]   because I suffered that major concussion in February.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:57.700]   I stepped on a mat in May for the first time.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.020]   I lost five straight tournaments.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.740]   I left the national team, went to Japan,
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.580]   won Pan Am Games, got a bacterial infection at the Worlds,
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.460]   almost had my leg cut off,
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.140]   tore my SI joint later on that year,
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.300]   and then took fifth in Japan.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.440]   And when you look at like the calendar year as a whole,
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.300]   like the world should have treated me like I was washed up.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.700]   Like this guy hasn't been training,
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.860]   he hasn't been doing anything, but I took fifth in Japan.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.340]   Now, how does a guy that hasn't trained all year
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.640]   take fifth at one of the hardest tournaments in the world
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.980]   on two weeks of training?
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:38.300]   Because they were fighting the guy I used to be,
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.520]   not the guy I was at the tournament,
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.980]   which means they were competing under the idea of like,
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.300]   what is he really capable of,
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.580]   not what have I brought to the table today.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.700]   - And that just gave you the confidence.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.660]   - And that told me that like,
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.900]   well, if I can take fifth
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.780]   and I'm this bad at judo right now,
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.140]   wait until I'm healthy and I'm back in shape,
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.780]   then they're not gonna know what hit them.
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.180]   - One of the essential components
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.700]   of being the number one in the world
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.980]   or up in that place is that confidence, the self-belief.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.020]   - And the rest of the world believing it.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.540]   You can have all the confidence in the world,
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:20.120]   but if the rest of the room doesn't buy it, it's nothing.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.060]   - That's funny.
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.620]   It's like there's certain people, right?
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.700]   Joe Tyson, Mike Tyson.
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.780]   - They all understand he could not train
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.980]   and they're still scared.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.720]   Right?
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.420]   Like he doesn't have to work out that hard anymore.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.900]   - There's several judo, you know this way better,
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.380]   but from a spectator perspective,
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.140]   like Ilias Iliadis is like that.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.480]   - He's one of them.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.320]   - It's like he-
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.740]   - He's portrayed over the years.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.720]   - Why is everyone so scared of that guy?
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.700]   It's interesting.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.300]   People were scared of you too.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.460]   - People just gave a certain level of respect
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.380]   to my skillset and whether I had a bad weight cut
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.180]   or didn't have a bad weight cut
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.100]   or not trained for the last three months,
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.380]   which never happened, I'm just saying,
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:04.300]   they were gonna fight the persona.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.460]   And it's an important distinction
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.860]   when you're looking at the top five
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.120]   because everybody coming up,
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.860]   they're training against the persona, not who you are.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:19.860]   Even I did that at a younger age.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:22.660]   That's why I would always go to people's hometowns
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.140]   'cause I don't care about the persona.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.980]   I wanna know what you do day in and day out.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.060]   When I couldn't beat a Russian,
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.740]   I told Jimmy, send me to Russia.
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.340]   I need to understand and see it with my own eyes
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:38.140]   what they do, outperform so that I can believe
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.860]   that I can beat them.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   - Can I ask you on this, a small tangent.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:46.380]   Dagestan has produced some incredible wrestlers.
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.620]   I don't know what the story with judo is
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:53.620]   where the source of greatness in Russia is for judo,
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.620]   but what do you make of Dagestan?
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:00.140]   What is it in the culture of there or Russia broadly
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.640]   that produces greatness?
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.380]   - Specifically in the combat sports.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.580]   - I don't know, yeah, specifically in the combat sports,
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.780]   sorry, but I don't know if you wanna draw a distinction
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.820]   between wrestling and judo.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.860]   I'm almost curious, do you understand the differences there
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.140]   in the culture?
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:17.140]   - Still a combat sport to them.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:21.420]   They're still in that same realm of they're taking
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:26.260]   young kids and that's what they do.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.140]   - So Khabib speaks very highly of judo.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:29.980]   - Yep.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.540]   - Like it's funny, Khabib, Vladimir Putin.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.220]   - People don't get it, but judo's like one
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.580]   of the premier sports in the world.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:39.940]   But we just don't understand it.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.460]   - It's not just popularity, so definitely popularity,
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.940]   but also like this respect.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.100]   And there's a certain thing,
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:50.500]   which is why I really value judo internationally.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.820]   You don't get this in the United States,
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.340]   but internationally there's an understanding
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.260]   like later in life when you're a scientist
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.700]   meeting a businessman, when you both have done judo,
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.380]   there's this like nod of respect.
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   - Yeah. - It's so interesting.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.900]   There's very few sports like that.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.380]   Basketball doesn't have any,
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.740]   I don't know almost any sport like that.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:12.740]   And it's fascinating.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.620]   Wrestling has that in the US, it is the US only.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.140]   The rest of the world doesn't do that.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.060]   - There's a few, like you could see that in like Iran
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:21.900]   or something like that.
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.260]   - Yeah. - They'll respect wrestling
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:24.740]   in that kind of way.
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:28.180]   Yeah, but judo on like a global scale
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.820]   is probably that only one.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:34.500]   Due to its like physicality and the hardships
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.180]   that you have to go through to reach that upper level.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.580]   - So why do you think Dagestan,
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.460]   why do you think Khabib is as good as he is?
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.900]   Is this just the raw genetics of the human
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.860]   or is there something about the system?
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.100]   - The system, it all has to do with the system.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.620]   - So they grow up around fighting in all forms.
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:56.460]   - Yep.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:00.500]   - They're also, I mean their technique is exceptionally good.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.780]   - Because they grow up in it.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.300]   - They grow up in it.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:08.340]   - They don't understand anything else.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.620]   - So you don't have to, it's almost like you
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.180]   with the weight cutting.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.900]   It's not like a big dramatic thing for them to fight.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.060]   It's like, this is just part of life.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.300]   - Yes, and when you're, I don't wanna say bred into it,
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.380]   but when you've done it for,
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:26.660]   I wanna say like 90% of your life
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:29.340]   by the time like Khabib probably has,
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.760]   right from the time he could crawl,
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.900]   he's probably been grappling in some fashion thereof.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.980]   You know, when you as grapplers,
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.940]   like you can look at a wrestler
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:44.740]   and having never seen this person before and go,
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.020]   you wrestled.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.180]   - Yeah.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:48.340]   - Why is that?
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.620]   It's because he's probably wrestled since he was like six.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.780]   So the way he carries himself, the way his body is built,
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:59.720]   the way he grew into it was framed around wrestling.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.780]   Right, so the people in that culture
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.260]   are framed around fighting and grappling.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.940]   - You're right, it's like, first of all,
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.340]   philosophically, psychologically,
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.260]   but also just like the way you move your body.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.100]   - Yes.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.740]   - That means like when you're young,
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.620]   the people you admire move their body
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.020]   in a certain kind of way.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.100]   - And then genetically, it just, as they keep doing that,
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.500]   they're just gonna get better and better every generation.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.620]   - Yeah.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.860]   - It's just gonna keep improving
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.020]   because they just keep building into that system
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:31.420]   of turning them out.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:34.380]   - And part of it, there's like cultural stuff where,
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.060]   I mean, it's such an interesting approach
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.220]   to wrestling, I really wanna travel to Dagestan
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:40.860]   and just talk to them 'cause I happen to be able
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:45.460]   to speak Russian 'cause there's less value
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:49.500]   for this kind of materialistic success
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.500]   that I think sometimes can get in the way of greatness,
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.580]   it seems like.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.420]   It makes coaching more difficult,
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.820]   it makes like following orders as an athlete more difficult.
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:02.860]   - We struggle with that in USA Judo, yeah.
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:05.080]   - 'Cause you want more money,
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.100]   but then more money, if not applied correctly,
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:11.180]   can corrupt the system somehow, can split people up.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.220]   It's just, it's same thing with the prestige
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:15.100]   around certain medals over others
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:20.100]   because athletes start chasing fame instead of development.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:25.180]   - Yeah, yeah, that's, I mean,
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:27.220]   the Sateo brothers are famous for this,
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.580]   like ignoring fame, ignoring all of this,
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.980]   like focus on the art itself.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.300]   Not even, so it's not even the medals,
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.340]   exactly like you're saying,
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.060]   just the purity of like when you're in it
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.300]   and let everybody else figure out their stupid medals
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:41.140]   and money and all that.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.180]   - 'Cause it comes.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.220]   - It comes, right, exactly.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.340]   - It's a result.
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.900]   Like it's not that you don't appreciate it,
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.340]   but you know that it comes if you focus on the art.
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.420]   - There's a distinction when you're talking
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:58.420]   about your athletic career or really any endeavor, right?
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:03.380]   The problem with goal setting is nobody teaches the athletes
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:07.760]   or the people how to transition from the goal to reality.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.620]   Right, so when you look at my career as a whole,
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.220]   like when I was getting ready for 2008,
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:17.300]   I actually forgot to train for it.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.300]   I was so happy at such a young age that I became an Olympian
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.220]   that that in and of itself was a goal
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.100]   that I thought had to be admired, had to be celebrated,
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.820]   that the games are right around the corner.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.660]   I didn't really come down off that high.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.100]   - You're the local optimum of just winning the trials.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:39.380]   - Yeah, it's a big thing.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.460]   - It's a huge thing, but then you're just focusing
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.060]   on the accomplishment, not the-
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.700]   - Correct, but at some point, right,
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.880]   when I went into London,
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.540]   I actually went into London going with,
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.260]   I'm gonna prove I'm the best in the world
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.420]   'cause I believe I'm the best in the world.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:58.580]   And I believe it from like the bottom of my soul
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.380]   that I'm winning this.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.340]   And then you're almost like trying to tell the universe,
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:07.660]   like I'm accomplishing this thing because it's a goal.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.120]   But when I went into Rio,
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.900]   I just accepted the fact that I was winning.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:16.820]   It's not a goal, like this is happening.
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.480]   - You visualize it?
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.580]   - But I felt it.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.460]   - You felt it.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:23.160]   - Right, like this is no longer a goal anymore.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.460]   Like I anticipated, like this is happening.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.000]   I can see this coming down the path
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.780]   because I'm anticipating that the games is happening
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:34.620]   and I'm gonna win.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.860]   It's not a goal, it's an anticipation.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.940]   And there's a distinct distinction there between the two.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:43.860]   - Okay, so for people who are just watching the video
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   of this, there should be an overlay of young Travis.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:52.820]   This is, you still had to make 81.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.960]   Is this still a tough cut here?
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.720]   - No, this one was relatively easy.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.740]   This is going all the way back to 2008.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:03.500]   So this is the summer before the games.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:08.500]   This probably happened in June, I would say.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.740]   - So this is the Olympic trials.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.620]   So in the United States, you have to,
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.980]   I mean, similar to like wrestling,
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.300]   you have to win trials to qualify
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.700]   for that particular division to represent the United States.
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:24.620]   So this is, you said June before an August Olympics.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:25.740]   - Yep.
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:27.940]   - So here, I just wanted to show this match
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:32.300]   'cause there's another one, I think you do a pin,
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.420]   you do some nice groundwork in the other one.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.740]   But in this one.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:39.300]   - Fighting a teammate.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.260]   - Fighting a teammate.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.100]   - Former teammate.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.420]   Oh, there's an old school double leg.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:43.620]   I forgot about that.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.760]   And it's weird to see.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.740]   - So there, Travis's opponent,
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.780]   and Travis is setting up here that Sanagi
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.000]   posting his left arm and getting it done.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.400]   That's a big throw.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.040]   You'd have too many of those big throws on video.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.840]   'Cause like you often on video,
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.680]   you're going against the best people in the world.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.240]   It's tough to get like that much air.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.040]   - And a lot of times the ones that we do see
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.560]   and the part that a lot of people don't experience
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.760]   is a lot of those times
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.800]   where I threw people with that throw,
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.720]   it was in training camps.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.080]   So by the time I got to the competition with these guys,
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.440]   they were playing 100% defense to never let me do that.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.480]   - Yeah.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   So you do this, here, are you kind of pulling him down?
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.640]   - No, I'm trying to get him to come up.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.600]   - But are you pulling him down to get to fake him out?
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.760]   - I'm not doing anything with my left hand.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.880]   - So here the opponent is--
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.520]   - So what I'm doing right now is his head is like
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:56.040]   in my chest, I'm pressing him to get his head to lift
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.160]   with my chest.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:01.000]   So I'm pressing his hand down so I can use my chest
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.200]   to like pinch my scaps and roll his head up
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.760]   so that he wants to pick it up.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.640]   - And then he, I mean, doesn't he know what's coming here?
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.680]   Oh no, he might not.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.440]   - Oh no, he knew, he was a former teammate.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.600]   He knew exactly what I was trying to do.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.240]   - And that was a really big step with your right foot.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.920]   - It covers about four feet.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.280]   So you step-- - Distance.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:31.440]   - And your left catches up in like perfect position
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.600]   for the hips. - Yeah, you back it up
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.440]   a little bit.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.040]   Keep going, keep going.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.040]   Right there, this is like an important distinction
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.280]   between mine and everybody else's
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.260]   is because I split his hip,
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.960]   I actually, once I'm able to split,
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.800]   I no longer need his center of gravity below mine.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.880]   - Right, and when you say split,
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.560]   you mean you put your foot in between--
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.640]   - I do that split, that four foot split.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:02.480]   - Yes.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.720]   - And then when I get my feet back together,
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.000]   it doesn't matter that I'm under his center of gravity
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:07.840]   or not.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.000]   That's why my chest is right around his like sternum height
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.200]   for me.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.960]   - Yeah, so there, I mean, how does he get,
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.160]   for people just listening to this,
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.920]   Travis steps, he does a big, huge step, gets--
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:26.880]   - Like my hip is probably right around his nipple
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.920]   'cause he sprawled back so much.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.440]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:33.240]   So like, so you're, how does the physics of this work?
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.360]   You're violating the principle of your center of mass
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.960]   being under, oh, I guess somehow it is.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.840]   I don't know, but he has nowhere to go.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:41.960]   He's screwed.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.360]   - Yes, that's the kicker is the way mine works
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.880]   is in order for him to play an effective defense,
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.000]   he needs to have his feet firmly planted on the ground
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.480]   with friction.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.320]   - Yeah.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.080]   - Otherwise he can't press into me to stop it.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:02.400]   So when I get him to sprawl back, when I split his legs,
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.640]   he effectively loses that contact with the floor.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.760]   Even though his feet are on the floor,
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.240]   they're not in a position where he can drive from them.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.080]   - Yeah.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.880]   - Therefore, when I flip, he flips.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.720]   - So there's a natural flailing here.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.320]   So he's not falling forward.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.720]   You're falling forward.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.560]   - Yeah.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.380]   - He's just attached to you.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.120]   So you can keep him up there
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.120]   and then legs would be just flailing.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:27.960]   - Yeah.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.800]   One of my golden rules when I'm training
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.720]   and I get really tired,
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.680]   one of the mantras I would always tell myself is,
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.640]   I'm gonna put my back on your chest
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.640]   and then I'm gonna put my back on the floor.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.480]   - Yeah.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.560]   - 'Cause then you'll be underneath me.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.960]   - It's a good principle.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.960]   - Very simple.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.520]   And it, regardless of like all the chaos
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.400]   and how quickly things are happening,
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.480]   it's something I can just dumb everything down to
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.840]   and focus on.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:54.280]   Regardless of the gripping situation, the footwork,
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.480]   all of that, get my back to your chest
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.200]   and then put my back on the floor.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.440]   - So this step of getting your back to their chest,
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.920]   like for people who are sort of more,
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.240]   like for example, for people like me,
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.600]   who are just like amateur Judo people,
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.920]   like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this turn
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.560]   from happening, the gripping and just everything.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.440]   How difficult is it at the highest level
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.840]   to get into this position?
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.000]   I mean, you make it look effortless often,
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.960]   but like to get to a position where you're from facing them
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.680]   to your back is to them,
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.560]   is that like strategies, that timing, is that?
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.900]   - Timing, it's timing.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.320]   It's like anything, like if I wanted to punch you
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:41.160]   in the face, like how hard is it to really do that
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.280]   if you know you can just play defense and block it?
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.280]   The trick is to get them to play defense
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.180]   to something that never happened.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:52.560]   - And then you go through like another way.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.800]   - And then you just go through what would technically
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.240]   be your first plan if you planned on them playing defense.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.200]   So I set the stage from the very beginning for this to work.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:07.320]   - So then this, you're celebrating here,
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.680]   it's a huge sort of, once a big accomplishment,
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.000]   big relief to qualify for the Olympics.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.740]   And then you go into the Olympics
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.440]   and this is where I first saw judo.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.360]   And I kind of thought of them as the same as judo
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.200]   and jiu-jitsu.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.440]   And I was really impressed by your performance
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.400]   in that Olympics.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.580]   The footage nowhere to be found these days,
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:34.280]   but at that time, I think you could still,
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.940]   you could watch it live on NBC Olympics
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.880]   or somewhere like that.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.200]   And I remember watching several of your matches.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.200]   One of them was the match against Ole Bischoff, the German.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.640]   And I remember being, it'd be nice if you can talk
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.400]   to that match because I don't remember it.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.720]   All I remember is being frustrated
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.520]   by him not letting you play judo.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.420]   - Yeah.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:03.480]   - So obviously you faced him again four years later
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.500]   and there's a lot of frustration there as well.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:09.160]   But I remember being extra frustrated in 2008.
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.280]   What was that match like?
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.920]   So he might've been number one in the world at the time
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:13.760]   or up there.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:18.400]   - He was up there for sure, especially going into 2008.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.760]   - He was really high up there.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.600]   - Yeah.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:24.080]   - And did he win gold at that Olympics?
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.760]   - Yes.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.580]   - Yeah.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.440]   - 'Cause he's silvered in London.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.400]   It was the same Olympic final, both in 2008 and London.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.320]   - Yeah.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.660]   Okay, so you're facing him there.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:36.700]   Were you intimidated?
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:37.540]   What was the strategy?
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.620]   Can you talk to that match?
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:43.840]   Because it kind of sets the stage for the rematch in 2012.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.020]   - Yeah, he was somebody that I had trained with in the past.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.920]   And for some reason, when it comes to him and I,
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.520]   when we train together,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.780]   it's more of a physical altercation
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:59.440]   than a judo training session.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.440]   It's just like the coaches have had to break us up
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.280]   a few times.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.960]   - Or you guys get almost angry too?
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.800]   - A little bit.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.360]   It always goes farther than it should for,
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.600]   we're friends, we say hello to each other.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.520]   But for some reason, when we train together,
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:19.400]   there's something about him and me that just oil and water.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   I don't know what it is.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.720]   - It could be also the gripping
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.600]   because he's a great gripping strategist.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.420]   - Yeah.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.360]   - Does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.960]   and then you get pissed off and then you frustrate him?
[01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.100]   - And then he gets pissed off
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.020]   and then before you know it,
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.660]   somebody's kicked somebody or punched somebody in the mouth
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.740]   or done something.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:38.100]   - Yeah, so one of the only evidences we have online
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:43.100]   of you fighting him is your foot in his groin area
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:46.580]   is the only thing we have from that Olympics.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:47.740]   - From 2008.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.940]   - From 2008, yeah.
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:52.700]   - And to answer everybody's question, yes, it was deliberate.
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:53.940]   - Now you can say this.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:54.780]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:58.100]   - But yeah, I remember there being a lot of frustration.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.920]   You're actually going for a lot of stuff
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.800]   like sacrifice throws.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.960]   I mean, maybe you're not going for the highest scoring
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.280]   and ponds, but you're just trying to shake things up
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.480]   if I remember correctly.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:09.880]   - Yeah, because when he, I was so young then that,
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:13.120]   and he was in his prime really at that time, right?
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:18.120]   He must've been 24, 25, 26,
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.320]   world medalist, European champion at the time.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.360]   And when he would grab me,
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.460]   I had that sense of feeling stuck.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:30.320]   Like I was strong enough if I used all my strength
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.240]   to not let him do anything,
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.640]   but then you can't be offensive
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:34.880]   when you're using all your strength
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.200]   to hold onto the situation.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.920]   So I was getting really aggravated
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:43.360]   because I couldn't generate any offense
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.680]   with every time I felt like I gained an advantage
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:47.240]   in the gripping scenario,
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.000]   he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like,
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.680]   well, now I've got to go address this thing,
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.880]   give up what I gained and I have to go back.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.580]   And if I were to think about watching the match now,
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.820]   it probably looked like a lot of flailing
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.500]   because we're just trying to generate enough
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.020]   to not get a penalty,
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.860]   but also not enough to where he could counter it.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:11.900]   - Did you think you could beat him?
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.260]   Like when you were walking into the match?
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.060]   - Until I gripped him for the first time,
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:19.180]   like I had trained with him before,
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:22.020]   he felt stronger and more in shape
[01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.740]   than I've ever felt him that day.
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:25.580]   - At that Olympics?
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.400]   - At that Olympics.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.880]   Which begs a whole nother question, but.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.120]   (laughing)
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.880]   I remember when he grabbed me for that first time,
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.660]   I went, this is different.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.800]   And there was a sense of panic at the time
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.000]   'cause I was like, holy crap, where did this come from?
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.960]   This is not the guy that I've trained with,
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.000]   that I expected.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.920]   'Cause it was a definite like level change
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.760]   in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.440]   - Like looking back at that, can you explain that?
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.360]   Is it just you being more, less confident
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:05.760]   because it was the Olympics?
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.640]   Is there some kind of routine that he followed
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.920]   to like really level up in intensity
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.260]   for this particular event?
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:17.260]   - I've been told that he only gets to like his prime
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:20.360]   for like really big events.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.000]   Like he doesn't train like year round like I would train.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.520]   But when it comes to like the games,
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.120]   he doesn't do social media, he doesn't work,
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.480]   he lives, breathes, eats his training for the games,
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.560]   which could institute that level.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.760]   - What about you?
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.560]   Is there a, like Dan Gable famously said,
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.520]   like the one loss he had in college,
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.200]   he was doing a lot of media and stuff.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.400]   Back then there was no social media.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.640]   That was a huge mistake for him.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.240]   - Do you do social media?
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.200]   Do you do like--
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.520]   - At this point?
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.760]   - Well, at that time it was like AOL.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.040]   I don't know, what's 2008?
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.640]   - I didn't even have a Facebook page,
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.620]   MySpace, nothing at this point.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:04.280]   I got my first Facebook page from the USOC in 2012.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.440]   When I went through the media thing,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.720]   the lady was like, "You have to have it."
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.920]   I go, "I don't want it, I don't like people.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.920]   "I want to deal with the people.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.240]   "What am I supposed to do?"
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.320]   - You know, like the social part of the social media.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.160]   - No.
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.680]   - Okay, I have to bring this up
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.840]   'cause, and then you went on to face Diego Camilo.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.960]   You lost that match, but you went on to win bronze.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.520]   That's also an interesting one, but we can skip ahead.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.040]   I just remember being really impressed
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.460]   both by your groundwork.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.320]   - That was a match I should have won.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.160]   - Yeah.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.000]   - I should have won that.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.520]   I was, if you don't know judo,
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.920]   you would visually watch that and be like, "I'm winning."
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.280]   But he was technically winning on the scoreboard,
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.800]   so it is what it is.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.560]   But the point that he got that solidified his win,
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.840]   yes, it was a point back in those days
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.560]   so I can't say anything, but like,
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.880]   my shoulder nicked the ground.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.440]   So it's like, I don't know.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.600]   - Yeah, a lot of the stories of your Olympic career
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.720]   is like, from a fan perspective,
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.760]   it seems like you should have won
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.160]   or you very close to could have won.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.000]   - Yes.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.360]   - And there was a lot of frustration in you
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.180]   and your game being like shut down in certain ways.
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:19.180]   But like the thing that immediately grabbed me in 2008
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:23.040]   was how much, something about the way you approached judo,
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.960]   how much you wanted to win.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.520]   - 'Cause I was young then.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:31.080]   I was, when I was at this time in my career,
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.120]   I was out to like win.
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.400]   Like there was no like, I'm gonna grab you,
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.520]   I'm gonna throw you, and if not,
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.360]   you're gonna go through a battle.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.180]   - Yeah.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.720]   - You're gonna make sure you earned it.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.140]   It so happened that you competing in 2008,
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:51.240]   I was, I became a fan of yours at that moment.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.040]   And since then, I kind of knew about judo.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.640]   My university had a judo club
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:01.800]   and I kind of knew about jujitsu from mixed martial arts.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.280]   And obviously I wrestled for many years before
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.020]   and I love wrestling,
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.960]   but there's something about you competing that made me,
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.080]   well, there's no other way to say it,
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.680]   but it like changed the direction of my life.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.360]   'Cause it forced me to say, you know what?
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.040]   I'm gonna start judo and jujitsu.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.820]   And first of all, for that, I'm really grateful,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.120]   but it's fascinating to think
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.220]   because this kid who's 22 years old,
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.720]   I'm sure I'm not the only one that you've influenced,
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.080]   like you've changed the direction of my life
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:33.600]   and there could be huge number of others like that.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.880]   I mean, that's the power of you as an individual
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.800]   on the Olympic stage.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.200]   You ever think about the pressure of that?
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.680]   Did you think as a 22 year old,
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.520]   there's a bunch of people,
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.720]   like I know I'm not the only one who changed.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.720]   I just happened to have like a microphone recently.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.480]   You know what I mean?
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.560]   Like, is that, it's fascinating to think about, right?
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.320]   Like you, perhaps you didn't think about this.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:59.440]   It's just a judo match,
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:02.280]   but you're like you influence hundreds of thousands
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.480]   of people if not millions.
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.880]   Is that interesting?
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.680]   - It's not something that really hit me
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.680]   until 2012 when I lost,
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:18.960]   because that's when like,
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.600]   I would say like the world felt bad for me at that point.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   And that's when you knew that like people were watching
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.160]   and people were inspired by the loss
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.320]   because of how much went into that match.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.160]   Because, you know, the 99% of us who watched it
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.600]   thought I won, except for the 1% of the people
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.560]   who were considered judges at that day in the event.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.320]   - But I mean, that's the win or lose
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.280]   that was a really inspiring match.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.080]   - And that's when it dinged that like,
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:02.120]   because I don't watch something and really get inspired
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:05.260]   by like the person and the act.
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.480]   It's like, it's an accumulative thing.
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.200]   But for a lot of people,
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.880]   like when they watch how much goes into it,
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:16.120]   and then when I broke down on the match,
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.880]   like the amount of suffering that happens
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.360]   when you lose a match like that.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:25.360]   And then, you know, really coming back and winning in Rio,
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:29.320]   there's a trend of people who were inspired
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.000]   that knew about London.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.600]   And then when they found out I won in Rio,
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.980]   that's when like people like in droves felt like
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:39.500]   they could overcome their own personal obstacles
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.500]   to still achieve something
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:44.240]   because they've witnessed somebody who's fallen
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.380]   and gotten back up.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.380]   - Yeah.
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:51.580]   - But it's not something that you think about like on the day
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:56.020]   it's when you look back and you go, oh, cause and effect.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:57.740]   - I wonder if you can comment on that.
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:01.840]   I'm trying to realize and live up to the fact
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.780]   that there's like young people that come up to me
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:09.340]   and I'm starting to realize like certain words I say
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.500]   will have a long lasting impact on them.
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:12.340]   - Yep.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:15.580]   Cause you say it as like, you don't even, it doesn't just.
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.420]   - Yeah.
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:17.240]   - The whim.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.420]   - Some of them might come back 30 years later
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.860]   and a word I said was the reason they quit a thing
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.740]   and started the new thing that led them
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.980]   to become their true self, like to find success,
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:29.300]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.860]   - On the flip side though,
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:33.900]   some people based on the actions that we do today,
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.900]   even with this cast will alter the course
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:40.180]   of their lives forever.
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:44.900]   I had a guy one time, was it after London?
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.980]   And it must've been after London.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:50.220]   He actually found me on Instagram,
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:54.000]   wrote me what seemed to be like a dissertation on Instagram
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.000]   about how much he, I disrespected him 14 years earlier
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:04.260]   because I didn't step on a podium to take a picture
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.980]   after winning a tournament where he bronzed.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.820]   - Yeah.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:11.700]   - And I'm thinking to myself, like at the time,
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:14.220]   like having dinner with my family
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.820]   because I had to leave the next morning
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.660]   was more important to me as a person,
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:23.660]   not thinking about who you potentially will become
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:28.780]   and the actions of whatever you do today,
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:32.300]   if you do become quote unquote famous
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.460]   or somebody in a spotlight
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:36.660]   that that could come back to bite you.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:37.780]   - To me, I don't know about you,
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:40.660]   that's super motivating,
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.660]   like not to be a lesser version of myself ever.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.460]   - Yeah.
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:48.500]   - Just be on top of your game,
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.260]   whatever that game is, be on top of your game
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.540]   when you're interacting with people
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:54.100]   and when you're just in your own private life.
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.300]   I'm trying to make sure that I'm the exactly same person
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.340]   privately as I am publicly
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:00.380]   and like making sure I'm on point.
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.740]   I see like just hanging out with Joe Rogan a lot.
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.900]   I see how he's, first of all, the exact same person.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:10.300]   And second, he like walks around
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.900]   and there's like a huge number of fans
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:15.020]   and he'll just take pictures and like, it's very cool.
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.620]   And it's very cognizant of like certain words he says,
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:20.420]   especially young people, like they're going to take that
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:23.380]   and that's gonna be a memory for them for a couple of years
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.220]   that might be influential for the rest of their life.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.900]   So it's, I don't know.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:31.740]   That's a cool responsibility, not to fuck it up.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:36.260]   But anyway, I bring all that up to just say, thank you.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:40.260]   So even if you like were frustrated
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:41.660]   that you didn't win a medal,
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:46.660]   at least you influenced one silly Russian kid
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:48.220]   to get into the martial arts.
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.140]   And what happens when you get into martial arts,
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:52.020]   it alters the direction of your life.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:54.700]   Mine for the better.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:59.700]   - Okay, so let's go to London, 2012 Olympics.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:05.300]   One of the most dramatic judo battles of all time, rematch.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:10.620]   So you've reached the semifinals once again
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.100]   to face the German, Oleg Bischoff.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.820]   Do you mind if we step through that match a little bit?
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.620]   - Welcome to by all means.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:23.220]   I've only ever watched the entire thing one time
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.820]   just because fucking.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:32.040]   - So for context for the listener,
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:36.380]   Travis, first of all, you don't like losing.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:38.700]   I think that's fair to say.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.740]   - You know, the hard part with this match
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:45.420]   is because I went into this Olympics thinking,
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:47.260]   I'm going to fucking win the Olympics.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:48.560]   I'm the best in the world.
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:53.460]   I never in my right mind thought,
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.940]   oh, I'm going to win a medal.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.300]   Like that never crossed my mind.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:06.300]   So it's like, I would have rather him just fucking beat me.
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:11.140]   Because then I lost.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.540]   - So here, the referees, as many people thought,
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:16.980]   robbed you of a victory,
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.700]   but it was also a really close battle.
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:22.860]   Again, with many of the elements of frustration as 2008
[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:25.380]   in terms of strategically and gripping wise.
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:28.720]   And it was just a fascinating battle that went to overtime.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.780]   So can you set the context?
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:33.420]   So what did the bracket look like?
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.980]   Who were the players here?
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:38.740]   Who did you beat leading up to this match?
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.620]   Like, as you walk onto the mat,
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:43.700]   what happened the day before, the hours before,
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:44.700]   as you're standing there?
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.340]   By the way, how bad is it
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:48.580]   when two people are standing like this?
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:51.360]   - And yes, that fucking guy, man.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:57.340]   But this bracket was really interesting
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.380]   if you look at like the backstory of 81 kilos,
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.020]   like leading up to the Olympics, right?
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.820]   Because at this point in time,
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.980]   I was inside the top 10 at all times,
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:14.140]   eight, seven, five, four, sixes.
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:16.020]   I fell out of there sometimes due to injuries,
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.460]   but I always climbed back in.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:23.500]   There was another guy from Azerbaijan
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.300]   that was the Olympic champion at 73 kilos in 2008.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:33.340]   And the entire division got rocked by match one
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:39.460]   because his first match was with Antoine Valas-Fortier
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:40.280]   of Canada.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:45.540]   And everybody who saw the draw come out was like,
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.740]   the Azerbaijan, he's going to win it.
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:49.900]   He's the former Olympic champion.
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:52.460]   He's pretty much won most of the major events,
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:55.540]   including at 90 kilos, 'cause he just had smooth judo.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:58:01.980]   And match one rolls around, match two rolls around,
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:05.340]   Antoine's in the shoot and he's looking around
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:09.100]   and he's like, the Azerbaijani is not here.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.700]   Well, where is he?
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:15.700]   No joke, he runs into the venue a match before,
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:19.640]   throws his gi on and runs onto the Olympic platform.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:23.540]   Loses the Canadian in like a three minute
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.820]   golden score battle.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:28.460]   - So do you think he warmed up?
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:29.380]   - Didn't, he ran.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.940]   He literally ran into the venue,
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:34.640]   threw his gi on and ran out, did no judo.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:39.140]   And there you see Antoine losing in the quarters.
[01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:42.940]   - So how good was Antoine?
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:45.800]   - At this point in time, this is, I believe,
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.660]   his first international medal was the Olympic games.
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:54.020]   So I don't think he'd ever medaled in Paris.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:57.280]   He went into this bracket unranked,
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.900]   beating the ranked guy first round because he,
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:03.020]   I don't know if he missed the bus.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:06.860]   I don't know if he was off his cycle and planned on losing
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:08.460]   'cause he didn't want to test positive.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.680]   I don't know.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:12.860]   There's a lot of like questionable things out there
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:16.000]   that could have potentially caused him to,
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.700]   run onto the Olympic platform for a match one.
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:26.760]   But it catapulted Antoine into like a belief that like,
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:32.000]   I beat the seated guy, I'm ready.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.600]   And that was like a turning point in the Canadian's career
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.600]   just as a whole, right?
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.000]   That's that everybody has a defining moment.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.040]   Like mine was when I beat Bischoff in Dusseldorf
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.800]   at the Grand Prix for Germany after 2008, right?
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:53.220]   I beat the Olympic champion on his home soil
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.480]   to go win the entire tournament.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.960]   So we all have like those moments.
[01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:00.120]   It's just when it happens at the games,
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:02.920]   it throws the bracket like into a tailspin
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:05.640]   'cause typically you'd know like who's going to beat who,
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:07.680]   where it's going to happen.
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:11.640]   And when you look at my quarter final against the Brazilian,
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:15.400]   what most people don't know is I was so thankful
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.500]   I had that match.
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:19.920]   Most people would never in a million years be like,
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.280]   I want to fight the world number one at the Olympic games.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.680]   That's what I want to do.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:25.880]   I want to be the eighth seed fighting the world number one
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.080]   'cause I'm going to win.
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:29.760]   I was pissed off at him.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:34.760]   I was so angry 'cause we were at the Pan Ams
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.040]   I think the year before and there was a team tournament
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.320]   and I wanted to fight him.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:45.320]   I had lost the quarters to a Cuban I think
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.880]   in like the first gripping exchange.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.320]   He threw me with a drop sale out of nowhere.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.440]   I was pissed.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.200]   So I wanted my hands on the Brazilian in the team match.
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.640]   Well, the Brazilian team is warming up.
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.120]   So I walk up to him, no joke.
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.560]   I walked up to him and I go, you're fighting?
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.800]   And he goes, not today.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:06.160]   And I went, are you fucking kidding me?
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.520]   I warmed up, I taped up.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:09.480]   You're the only fucking guy I want to fight
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.680]   and you're going to fucking sit in the stands
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:12.720]   and read a goddamn book.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]   I was so angry.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:15.640]   I carried that anger 'cause I never fought him
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.160]   until this day.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.280]   I was fucking pissed.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.820]   I was ready to beat him.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:20.660]   - That's right.
[02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:23.560]   I remember, I forgot he was the world number one.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:24.400]   - Yeah.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.240]   - How did, 'cause I remember like being really excited
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.080]   at that match.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:28.900]   How did you beat him?
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:31.920]   - I threw him with two hands on the same side collar
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.760]   like drop sale.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:35.680]   I cross gripped, I yanked him behind me and I threw him.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.520]   - Ipan.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:40.520]   - Was Ari and then the match ended 30 seconds later.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:41.640]   - Yeah.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.840]   - I was pumped.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:45.080]   - I was, I thought, I think, okay,
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.600]   if I'm remembering correctly, I thought, okay,
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.920]   this guy might actually win gold.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:55.180]   That's what made for me as a spectator,
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:02:00.180]   remembering now the next match that much more like painful.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.600]   And then the fans of judo that really followed the sport,
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:08.720]   the stats, when you look at the games and my draws,
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:09.760]   I had the worst possible draw
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.400]   as you ever could have imagined.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:12.220]   - Yeah.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.160]   - At both London and Rio, I fought the world number one
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:19.140]   to get to the final or into the semis or past the semis.
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:22.460]   And everybody I fought in the draw
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.680]   either beat me the last time we fought
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:26.180]   or I had never fought before.
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:29.320]   So I always held a loss going onto the mat
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.280]   at the Olympic games.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.640]   - How'd you feel about that, by the way?
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:32.960]   Like, what were your feelings
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:35.400]   about facing the Brazilian first?
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:36.600]   - I was so excited.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.900]   Well, that was match three.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:41.400]   In London, I fought the Slovenian guy first round
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.960]   who beat me, where'd he beat me?
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.280]   Was it the worlds?
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.640]   Might've been the worlds.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:50.400]   And then Church's Ville, I fought in the second round
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:54.800]   who threw me for was Ari in Japan.
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:58.160]   And then Leandro, who I don't think I ever fought
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.400]   who was world number one.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.240]   That avoided fighting me at the team tournament.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.760]   - But I mean, every single Olympics you've fought
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.040]   and you really stepped up.
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:09.000]   - The only tournament I've ever prepped for.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.080]   - Mentally and physically and just the whole thing.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:11.920]   - Yeah.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.260]   We never trained through this tournament
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:18.480]   like we did for the others, or I would go into it injured.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.560]   - All right, well, let's talk about you're standing there
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.120]   next to that, to the German.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.360]   He looked always smaller than you,
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.260]   but you said like strong.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.100]   - Yeah.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:33.720]   - So what are you feeling now, Jimmy Pedro behind you?
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:35.520]   - I was ready to take his head off.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.880]   - Did you have an idea of what you're gonna do?
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.800]   Did you try to, you're thinking of winning by Ippon?
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.400]   Were you thinking like going for big throws
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.920]   or take him in deep waters, grip him?
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.160]   Or what were you thinking?
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.120]   - We were about to have a battle
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:54.040]   and I wasn't gonna throw him until he broke mentally.
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:56.000]   - Okay.
[02:03:57.900 --> 02:04:00.960]   - There was no like, oh, this is gonna be a clean throw.
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.180]   That was never, that was never the thought process.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:10.680]   - So here, you know there's going to be a lot of gripping.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:13.220]   So we're seeing a shit ton of gripping.
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:18.500]   - And right here, he throws it, bang, close fisted.
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.780]   - You got a lot of adrenaline.
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:22.620]   You seem calm.
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.480]   - I'm pissed.
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:24.320]   - You're pissed.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.140]   - Like, are you serious? - You don't look pissed.
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.240]   You just look like.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.820]   - I'm looking at the ref like,
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:28.740]   'cause he keeps telling me to get up.
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.940]   I'm like, I have blood running down my face.
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:36.160]   I go, okay, here, see blood.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.020]   See, and he's like, oh yeah, go fix it.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:40.000]   - And that's on your eyebrow somewhere.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.280]   - Yeah, he split it just underneath it.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.400]   - So you split your eyebrow.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.840]   And so in judo, they don't, they're allergic to blood
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.880]   probably for a good reason, but they,
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.440]   so now you have to try to figure out how to tape that up.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.320]   - Yeah.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:57.000]   - Which already sets up one of the most bad-ass
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.780]   looks in judo history.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:04.100]   - First 15 seconds busted my eye open.
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:06.340]   - Was that getting in the way of your eyesight at all or no?
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:07.180]   - No.
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:10.740]   - Damn, he looks good at gripping.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:12.940]   How difficult is it to get a grip on that guy?
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:13.780]   - Very.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.660]   See, like I'm struggling just to get my hand in the collar
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.260]   and he wasn't even blocking it.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.460]   - Is he being cagey?
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:20.300]   - Yeah.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.540]   - Remember like, is he interested in offense?
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:27.320]   - Nope, he's a very cagey, you know, methodical player.
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:30.320]   Like he never opens himself up.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.920]   - Yeah.
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.520]   There you go, you grab the leg as part of a combination.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:35.360]   - Yeah.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.480]   - And people have told me
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:39.840]   that he's actually very good at throwing people.
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:43.400]   He just doesn't, so, but he just doesn't show it at these.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:46.640]   - Nope, 'cause he doesn't care how he wins,
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:48.320]   he cares that he wins.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.160]   - Yeah.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.040]   - Which makes him very difficult to beat
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:55.360]   'cause he knows when you've strategized to do that,
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.560]   where you look at the rule set
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.480]   and you develop a plan to get through the matches,
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:01.920]   then you've really got to figure out a way
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:04.520]   to get that person off that game plan.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:07.420]   You know, whether you get a head by a penalty or something.
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:10.220]   Right there.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.800]   Like, he wouldn't give me the sleeve,
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.840]   so I grabbed all of his fingers.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:17.160]   - Oh, nice.
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:21.160]   In which, open like this way or?
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.960]   - I grabbed them the other way and I started lifting them.
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:24.800]   - Ah, yeah.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.920]   - Like I start, like reverse playing Mercy.
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.320]   - Like this, yeah.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.160]   (laughing)
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.560]   Oh, this is great.
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:31.680]   - 'Cause he wouldn't give me the sleeve
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:33.040]   and I needed an attack.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:36.120]   And I'm like, okay, I can't hold onto this forever
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.240]   'cause that judge is gonna see it,
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:38.740]   so let me just do a quick throw here
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:40.360]   while I'm using the fingers in the Mercy grip.
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:43.820]   - He's holding on and you kind of wrist it out.
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:44.660]   - Yeah.
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:49.760]   And then he goes to get up and I go to get on top
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:50.800]   and right here.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:52.640]   - Nice.
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:53.480]   - That elbow.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:54.300]   - You get him?
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:55.140]   You got him.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.400]   - Yeah, it looks like I elbow him.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:58.560]   - Did you do it kind of?
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.720]   - No, I didn't even, at the time,
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:02.240]   I never knew this happened.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.080]   - Yeah.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:06.260]   - Until after I watched this like three or four years later.
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:08.700]   Didn't even know, I didn't even feel it.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:09.540]   - Look at that.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.000]   So he's legitimately angry here.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:11.960]   - Yeah, he's angry.
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:15.700]   And of course, you can't, you can't move.
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:16.540]   Why would you move?
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:17.400]   - Look at this, look at this.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:19.160]   This moment right there is gold.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.400]   If you're not watching this on video, you're missing out.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:23.120]   You do, you never get this in Judo.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:25.440]   - No, I don't know if that's ever happened.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.880]   - That little face off.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.160]   - Especially on a stage like this.
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.280]   - The reference.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.200]   - And then he brings us in to like talk to us
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.760]   and he's like, "Hey, we're good, right?
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.880]   Like you guys aren't about to do
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:36.200]   what I think you're about to do."
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.200]   (laughing)
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.040]   - You put up your hands.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:39.920]   - And he's like, "Hey, shake hands again."
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:41.880]   'Cause the first time we did it, that wasn't good enough.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:43.320]   Well, you got to do it again.
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:47.380]   The heartbreaking part about this
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:51.260]   and why the IJF switched it to an unlimited golden score,
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.600]   because we fought five minutes
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.680]   through the entire normal part of the match.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:02.000]   And then we did the entire overtime period of three minutes.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.340]   Not one penalty was given.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:07.080]   No gripping infractions, no false attacks,
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:07.920]   like no stalling.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:08.860]   - That's great.
[02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:10.360]   Nobody was really backing up.
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.200]   - Yep.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.020]   - I mean, it was, you know.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:13.800]   So what was Jimmy telling you here?
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.560]   Or was he talking to you at all?
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.580]   - He's not allowed to talk during medical things
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.940]   and my nose is now broken.
[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:23.940]   - But he's also, oh, the nose is broken.
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.140]   From what?
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.620]   - I cut an elbow from him.
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:29.500]   Glad his face is clean.
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:30.980]   That's fun.
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:32.780]   And right here, like I was pissed.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.860]   I was so angry at the medic because he's fumbling around
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:37.900]   and I'm like, "My whole plan
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:39.660]   is to break the German mentally."
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:40.500]   - Yeah.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:41.580]   - You got to hurry up with the tape, man.
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.460]   Like he's supposed to be tired.
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.300]   Like he's not supposed to be resting.
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.280]   - And is Jimmy yelling here?
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:49.400]   - He can't.
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.600]   - No, not here, but during the match.
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:52.440]   - Yeah.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.840]   And you can see, I just take it from him
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.840]   and I'm like, "Give it to me.
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:55.780]   I'm going to do it myself.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.620]   Get out of here."
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:59.880]   - How scared is the medic?
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.600]   It's like this guy's going to kill me.
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:03.200]   - He can't even tear the tape.
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.540]   - Look how nervous he is.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.600]   (laughing)
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:10.940]   - We made fun of him for this so much throughout the years.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.400]   Still do to this day.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.360]   All right, here we go.
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.240]   - Oh, you look great.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.840]   - Get in here.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.840]   Can't really see, don't care.
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:19.820]   - Was there some outcome in your mind
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:21.340]   that you could possibly beat him on the ground
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.660]   with a submission or a pin?
[02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:24.280]   You knew you're going to have to throw him.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.060]   - I knew I was going to have to,
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:29.940]   if I was going to throw him or armbar him or pin him,
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:31.900]   whatever the case may be,
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:34.960]   it was going to be his mental, like,
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.420]   "I'm just tired of this."
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:37.260]   - Yeah.
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.080]   - Right?
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:38.920]   He's too cagey of a player.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:41.160]   He's too experienced.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:43.360]   You know, he has to mentally make that choice
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:44.860]   to give that inch.
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:47.240]   And then you just have to be ready to take it.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.740]   So I was just waiting for it.
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:53.380]   - And so now this is four minutes in, one minute left.
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:54.220]   - Yeah.
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:57.780]   - Oh, is that in your game plan two potential,
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.360]   like, assuming he sacrificed throws to him?
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:03.460]   - 'Cause the whole point of that technique
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.360]   and the sacrifice throws wasn't because
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.220]   I thought I was going to throw him,
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:11.780]   but it disrupts the pattern enough to, like,
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:13.780]   get him to make a potential mistake.
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.620]   - Yeah.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.760]   - Like, see, he should have gotten a Shido there,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.380]   hands in the face.
[02:10:18.380 --> 02:10:20.300]   But again, that's just part of Judo.
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:21.360]   - Yeah.
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:22.820]   - He poked me in the eyeball.
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:25.400]   - This is a rough match.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.740]   Does he act at all or no?
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:30.100]   Like, was he acting frustrated or anything like that?
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.400]   Or is it all, like, he's acting for the ref,
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:34.240]   you know what I mean?
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.880]   Like, oh, that, all that kind of stuff.
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:38.820]   You're just going in hard, nonstop.
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:39.660]   - Yeah.
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:43.660]   - Like, angry, aggressive, feeling cardio here at all?
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:44.500]   Like-
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.980]   - Nope, I don't, I didn't get tired during this.
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:47.820]   - And then-
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:48.780]   - I'm just always pressing forward.
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:50.260]   - Time runs out.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.860]   - Now we're into golden score.
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:54.620]   12 minutes and 38 seconds later.
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.860]   Yeah, you think about every Judo exchange, right?
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:10:59.340]   Every time we grip up, every time we attack,
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.420]   sometimes it can take longer to get back to the line
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.700]   than the entire exchange.
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:03.740]   - Yeah.
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:06.120]   So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have,
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:09.620]   the longer the time stretches.
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.700]   And then here, the six seconds left in golden score.
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:18.580]   Your tape is now yellow and red.
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.300]   - Yeah.
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:23.240]   - With sweat and blood, literally, and time is out.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:24.380]   Now, what are you thinking here?
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:25.940]   Do you think you won the match?
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.520]   - I thought I won the match a minute ago.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.740]   I remember thinking to myself, like,
[02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:35.700]   if this goes to the flags, I won.
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.640]   No doubt in my mind.
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:42.580]   Because I felt like the whole time,
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:44.860]   like I was going to him.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:45.700]   - Yeah.
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:46.520]   - Right?
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.020]   He was never coming at me.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:49.980]   - Yeah, that's the way it felt.
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:53.020]   I mean, like, that's the way it felt body language wise,
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:55.860]   just the intensity, how fast you're moving towards him.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:57.620]   You're constantly going for throws.
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:02.360]   - Now, if you want to rewind that,
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:03.700]   we can talk about the whole,
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.060]   'cause it's a part of this clip.
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:07.020]   - So wait, wait a minute.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.460]   They all went blue.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:09.300]   - They all did.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:12.180]   - So in judo, there's three referees,
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.820]   two on the side, one in the center,
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:14.660]   and they all vote on--
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.220]   - And now let's pause it right there.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:18.300]   Now, the way this is supposed to work,
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:21.920]   they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count,
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.180]   and then on three, they all raise it together.
[02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:25.020]   - Yeah.
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:28.300]   - Now, as a little pretext to this entire match,
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:32.420]   up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:34.820]   has ever been a split decision.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.620]   Meaning out of three people,
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.400]   not one of them voted against the other group members.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:44.580]   So they were all unified blue or all unified white.
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:45.420]   - Yeah.
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.240]   - Right?
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:49.260]   - Which is statistically difficult to imagine.
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:50.660]   - Yes.
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.940]   It's almost like they had a referee meeting and said,
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:57.060]   "It's better for the Olympics to never have a split."
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:58.340]   - Yeah.
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:12:59.180]   - Okay.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:02.900]   - So the question becomes,
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:05.060]   if you would click that frame by frame,
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.360]   right?
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.820]   So right now we have all the refs with their flags out,
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.020]   and then click that.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:14.180]   - So the middle--
[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.100]   - Middle guy is, he is all the way up.
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:17.940]   - All the way up.
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:20.320]   - The other side judges haven't moved.
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:23.700]   We now have one side ref all the way up.
[02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:26.680]   Then we have a third side ref all the way up.
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:29.460]   - Yeah.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:32.380]   So there's a time point when the middle guy
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:33.780]   has the flag all the way up.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:35.940]   - If not 80, 90% of the way there.
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:36.780]   - Yeah.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.500]   - Then the other one does, and then the third one goes.
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:44.820]   So now the question becomes, who really,
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:47.320]   like did the outside refs really have an opinion?
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:54.260]   Or were they told to wait for the center one to start,
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:59.420]   and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:01.500]   - Yeah, this is very unfortunate.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.340]   - Because--
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:03.700]   - It's very, honestly, it's very possible
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.060]   that they had this meeting.
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:09.940]   This is the problem with the Olympics.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:12.580]   They sometimes, it's also the problem
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:14.220]   in the Soviet Union with communism.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:17.900]   You think the committee knows what's good for the people,
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:20.740]   and so on, so they decide universally,
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:23.180]   as opposed to letting the magic of the Olympics
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:25.380]   be what it is.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:28.540]   But nevertheless, in this case,
[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.240]   the center ref decided blue.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:34.820]   Like what do you think, do you think it's just a shitty call,
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:36.580]   or like--
[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:40.020]   - He has the right to pick, but the problem is,
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:43.540]   is the other two, I don't think did.
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:45.460]   - Yeah, so, and that's the--
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:49.940]   - And so, when you do this frame by frame again, right?
[02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:54.340]   Like I can see from my own perspective two of the refs,
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:57.020]   and I see them both blue, right?
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:14:59.400]   So when you fast forward that a little bit
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.100]   to get to like all the flags, I see the two go blue,
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:06.220]   and I go, I look over, and I look at the other guy,
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:08.500]   and I'm like, really?
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.340]   - Yeah.
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:10.740]   - All three?
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:13.620]   I fought for eight minutes, and I can't even get a vote?
[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:15.860]   I didn't even get a penalty.
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:17.820]   I can't even get a vote?
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.020]   And that's when I broke.
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:24.600]   I like, oh, I couldn't believe it.
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:28.720]   And I'm not gonna lie, he looked shocked.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:34.820]   - And here you're underneath. - I'm just crying.
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:35.660]   - You're crying.
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:36.740]   - Literally crying. - You're crying.
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:38.260]   This is it. - Yeah.
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:39.100]   - But I think it's the end. - That was such
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:39.940]   an amazing match.
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:41.160]   That was such a war.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:45.500]   I mean, both people can't believe what happened.
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:48.220]   - I know, that's the, and like, honestly,
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:50.720]   I wish we had the rules that we do today
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.020]   as far as the unlimited golden score,
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:56.420]   because I would have loved to have seen
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:15:57.580]   what would have happened.
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:15:59.460]   - What was Jimmy saying here to you?
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.420]   I mean, I guess there's nothing to say.
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:06.460]   - Yeah, he was kind of apologizing
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:11.260]   for the way the scores went.
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:13.220]   - 'Cause he knows how badly you want it.
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:14.660]   He saw the match.
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:16.580]   - And he felt I deserve to win it.
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:18.180]   - Yeah. - Based on like,
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:19.240]   you know, what happened.
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:21.060]   - But he probably, with all his experience,
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:24.340]   knows that this is what the Olympics are about.
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:26.060]   The refs sometimes. - Yep.
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:27.800]   - I mean, that's the magic of it, man.
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:29.260]   - Well, and at the same time,
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:34.140]   we're at, we're in the Olympic semi-final
[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:37.860]   in a sport that's dominated by certain continents.
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:40.500]   And when you look at the three refs on the mat,
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:41.600]   they're all European.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.740]   - Yeah.
[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.380]   - You're telling me there couldn't have been one Pan Am,
[02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:49.040]   one African, one Oceania, you know, different,
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.420]   like why'd they all have to be European?
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:55.620]   - But to be fair, it's a back to your sauna story.
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:56.460]   - Correct. - Is that you've dealt
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:57.780]   with this stuff before.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.420]   - And you've won over this stuff before.
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:02.340]   - And that's why like I was broken for life.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.420]   - And you thought you won here, that was.
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:09.300]   - And when I hindered on that for a year and a half,
[02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:11.300]   like I couldn't even stand, I was done.
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:15.880]   But I'm pretty sure there's a slow motion replay on this
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:18.680]   when I watched it, yeah, he's all excited, that fucking guy.
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:20.580]   Yeah, and he's all happy.
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:23.600]   - It's relief, right? - Yeah, hey, hi guys.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:24.440]   I did it.
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:31.020]   - Yeah, so here's like slow motion replay
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:33.940]   of the flag being raised, the heart being broken,
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:35.060]   Travis just bending over.
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:37.060]   - Right here, watch, watch his reaction.
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:41.740]   You could see his mouth like open in awe, like really?
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:42.580]   - Yeah.
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:44.620]   - And he's looking at two refs just like I am.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.940]   He didn't celebrate until he looked at the third one
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:49.100]   and said, "Oh, all three."
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:50.580]   - So you think he knew he lost?
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.360]   - I think in his head, like,
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:55.460]   I don't think he really believed he was winning.
[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:57.180]   - He did enough to win, yeah.
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:00.120]   - Yeah, because when his mouth draw like,
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.900]   "Oh yeah, hey, all three,"
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:07.380]   like that's not really the reaction you would give.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:12.140]   - Yeah, I mean, that was one of the greatest matches
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:12.980]   I've ever seen.
[02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:14.340]   I mean, obviously it's painful for you,
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:19.340]   but that pain, first of all, sets the stage for 2016.
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:24.700]   But even without that, I think it was just a beautiful story
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:25.540]   at the Olympics.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:28.580]   You've still did incredible job at the Olympics.
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:30.300]   You stood toe to toe.
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:35.300]   - I think in hindsight, having lost that match
[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:38.640]   did more for me and more for the sport.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:40.460]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:42.620]   - As a whole, me losing that match.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:46.100]   - Yeah, I mean, stories aren't about winning,
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:48.020]   stories are about the fighting.
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:50.180]   So, and that made one hell of a story.
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:54.380]   But it also has to do with,
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:59.220]   treachery is probably not the right word to use.
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:02.540]   It's probably the wrong word entirely to use.
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:06.660]   But because of the conflict in the match
[02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:09.780]   and because of how the refs handled the match
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:13.100]   there at the end, it created controversy
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:18.020]   that was spoken about for months on world media.
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:21.260]   I remember articles being written about the Olympics
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:24.140]   and the reffing and how it was corrupt.
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:26.980]   And that match was one of them.
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:28.540]   There was another one in fencing
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:30.980]   where something happened with the timer
[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:33.840]   where one of the fencers,
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:35.200]   I guess what happens in fencing,
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:39.820]   the timer resets up a second if it's down.
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:42.620]   So, the fencer got one second played out,
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:47.380]   I think like 27 or 28 times and then one on like 30.
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:51.380]   So, there was like clock fixing for fencing,
[02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:54.500]   there was this match that I think just got publicity,
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:57.420]   good or bad, publicity is publicity for judo.
[02:19:57.420 --> 02:20:01.260]   - And then you came back to,
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.380]   I mean, this is the hard thing after this heartbreak
[02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:06.060]   to step up and continue fighting, right?
[02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:09.100]   - I really, really struggled,
[02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:14.100]   like unbelievably struggled from 2012 to like 2014.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:16.100]   I almost quit numerous times.
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:17.940]   I was so angry.
[02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:21.900]   I mean, at one point I got so mad at the IJF
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:24.820]   feeling like they were fucking me every step of the way.
[02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:28.660]   I threw a water bottle at a referee after a match.
[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:30.660]   I cussed out a referee one time on a mat.
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:32.300]   I got suspended from the sport
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.060]   because I was just so angry at that point in time.
[02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:39.100]   - And IJF is the International Judo Federation
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:41.640]   and they're, are they the people that supply the referees
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:42.480]   basically like the certification?
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:44.620]   - They kind of run the sport, they run the sport.
[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:45.620]   - On a global scale.
[02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:52.620]   - So you sent a few emails, 2014, '15, basically quitting.
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:57.220]   One of them said, "I'm mentally and physically broken."
[02:20:57.220 --> 02:21:00.460]   Another said, with a subject line, "I'm done."
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:01.300]   - Yep.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:02.700]   - The weight cuts didn't break you.
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:03.540]   - No.
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:06.780]   - So if this broke you,
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:09.540]   you were really going through a hard time.
[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:10.980]   - I was like, you know what?
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:13.100]   We're just gonna like dumb it down a little bit
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.500]   and get some wins under our belt.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:16.300]   I'm gonna go to a World Cup,
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:20.100]   which is like three stages down or four stages down
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:22.860]   from like the Olympic games.
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:24.540]   Like this should be like a cakewalk,
[02:21:24.540 --> 02:21:26.100]   like making the final of a World Cup
[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:27.740]   should be a walk in the park.
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:33.700]   I show up, I barely beat a 16 year old kid.
[02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:34.580]   - Yeah.
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:35.860]   - Barely.
[02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:37.820]   Then I got smoked in the second round.
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:39.300]   I got thrown three times.
[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:42.420]   I was like, I'm fucking done.
[02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:44.340]   They changed all the fucking rules.
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:46.100]   They fucked me out of the Olympics.
[02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:48.500]   Like, what am I supposed to do?
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:52.540]   And it was at that moment when I wrote the email,
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:55.580]   where I remember sitting at a bar,
[02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:56.420]   I don't drink by the way,
[02:21:56.420 --> 02:22:00.680]   but I was sitting at a bar at the hotel, sending this email.
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:04.260]   And I got a response back from Jimmy and he goes,
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:08.500]   "Well, just stay for the training camp, go to Germany.
[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:10.560]   "And then whatever happens, don't worry about it.
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.420]   "We'll talk when you get home."
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:16.100]   I was like, fuck that, fuck these people, fuck the rules.
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.300]   I don't fucking care anymore.
[02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:19.580]   I'm just going to do Judo the way I want to do Judo.
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:22.940]   If I fucking get shitoed out, fuck them.
[02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:24.900]   That was my response.
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:26.940]   - Can you become an Olympic champion?
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.480]   Can you become an Olympic medalist?
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:30.100]   Would that kind of thing, can you think or no?
[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:32.260]   Was that, that's counterproductive?
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:33.100]   - Yeah.
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:33.920]   - Okay.
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:37.740]   Just checking because maybe that's also liberating.
[02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:40.100]   - The expectation was no longer that Travis
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:41.260]   is going to win this tournament.
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:43.820]   The expectation was Travis is going to come home
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:44.780]   and be fucking pissed off.
[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:47.220]   We're going to have to figure out how to manage
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:49.220]   a pissed off person that's trying to quit
[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:50.880]   that shouldn't be quitting.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.720]   And--
[02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:54.380]   - Do people still believe that you can be a medalist again?
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:55.220]   - Yeah.
[02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:56.060]   - Like who believed that?
[02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:58.820]   - Jimmy believed it, the team managers believed it.
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:00.860]   Some of my teammates still believed it.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:03.660]   My training partner still did.
[02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:06.880]   But they're not the ones that are cutting the weight,
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:10.680]   flying around, feeling like, you know,
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:12.940]   all of your judo is now null and void, right?
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:17.020]   Because at this point, they took away leg grabs entirely.
[02:23:17.020 --> 02:23:20.100]   You couldn't break a grip with two hands, right?
[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:23.660]   The meta of judo has changed again, right?
[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.060]   So I got fucked out of it.
[02:23:26.060 --> 02:23:28.180]   They took away how I did judo again.
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:30.740]   And now it just got more difficult.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:34.740]   So when I'm sitting in the hotel and I'm sending this email,
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:36.940]   I remember being at the training camp, like,
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:40.300]   I was like, I don't even fucking care what the rules are.
[02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:41.840]   I'm just going to fucking throw people.
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:43.400]   I don't even care if I'm cheating.
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:44.960]   Doesn't matter to me, I'll just play stupid.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:45.880]   - Yeah.
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:46.720]   - Right?
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:48.680]   So I just started going back and doing judo
[02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:50.080]   without the leg grabs,
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:54.440]   but with all the same gripping that I was doing beforehand.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:57.520]   And then when I got to Germany, I was like,
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:58.640]   I don't fucking care.
[02:23:58.640 --> 02:24:00.800]   I was like, if I got to cheat to win,
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:03.060]   then I got to fucking cheat to win.
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:06.240]   If I get cheetoed out, like, then I get cheetoed out.
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.260]   And I won Germany.
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.980]   - Ah, which event in Germany?
[02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:12.420]   - The German Grand Prix, which was--
[02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:13.720]   - The German Grand Prix, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:16.140]   - A week after losing the world cup,
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:20.340]   because I was trying to do judo around the new rule set.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:23.220]   I wasn't just trying to do judo, right?
[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:25.820]   Because when you get to the highest level,
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:28.680]   your game tends to morph around,
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:33.060]   you know, what can you can or cannot get away with.
[02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:35.780]   I was more focused on trying to figure out what I can
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:37.060]   and can't get away with.
[02:24:37.060 --> 02:24:39.200]   And I stopped actively doing judo.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:42.600]   Once I said, fuck whatever the rule changes are,
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:43.840]   I'm just going to keep doing judo
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:45.360]   the way I know how to do judo.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:47.260]   And if I get a penalty, then so be it.
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:51.800]   - And so that win, that started the road back?
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:52.960]   - The road back, yeah.
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:57.600]   'Cause now it's like, I don't care if you penalize me
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:00.880]   or not, because I'm going to throw that guy anyways.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.520]   I'm going to beat him anyways.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.380]   And if I get a cheeto for doing something wrong,
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.680]   then I'll just stop doing that one thing
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:09.680]   and just keep doing all the other things that they told me
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.800]   I probably shouldn't be doing,
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:11.880]   but they're not calling me on it.
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.520]   So I'm just going to keep doing it.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:20.200]   - Well, you found yourself at the 2016 Olympics.
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:23.160]   Was that ever a doubt by the way,
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:27.040]   after this, after 2014 in Germany?
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:30.520]   - I had a lot of doubt after the concussion in 2015.
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:34.820]   I remember when I first came back
[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:37.860]   after four months of nothingness,
[02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:41.540]   that even trying to train,
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:44.700]   the room would start to tilt a whorl on me.
[02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:46.340]   And then when I finally got over that
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.700]   and I could start doing things again,
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:51.260]   I stepped on the mat for the Pan Ams and I was like,
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:54.220]   drowning's not the right word,
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:57.540]   but everything was being done in such a slow motion.
[02:25:57.540 --> 02:26:01.240]   I had sandbags everywhere that I just couldn't keep up.
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:04.460]   - Like mental fog.
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:07.020]   - Yeah, I remember fighting the Brazilian
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:10.620]   for in the semifinal of Pan Ams.
[02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:13.780]   I was halfway through this match and I'm just like,
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:16.380]   eyes roll up, I'm like, I'm just going to fucking wing it.
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:17.220]   And I just fucking winged it
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.980]   and I got countered and thrown free pwn.
[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.940]   And I was like, I don't even know what to do.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:24.420]   And I couldn't even think clearly.
[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:27.540]   And that's when I was like, I may not come back.
[02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:29.260]   - Yeah, you don't have control
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:30.380]   over how to come back from this.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:34.480]   It's just your mind and it's not operating correctly.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:36.780]   - I can like, oh, my right hand's not working
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:37.760]   because it's fractured.
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:39.360]   Let me figure out a way I can not use that.
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:40.960]   Like when your mind's not working,
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.320]   it's the one thing you need.
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:45.760]   Like you gotta have it.
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.520]   So then I can work through anything else.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:49.160]   I needed that though.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:51.480]   - And so how did you come back from that time?
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:52.880]   - That's when I wrote another email
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:55.080]   and I was like, I'm fucking off team USA.
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:57.480]   I'm not fucking, I'm all done with USA judo.
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:58.600]   I'm done with the tour.
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:00.160]   I was like, I quit.
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.900]   I'm gonna go do my own thing.
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.560]   And they were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:04.740]   Can't quit now.
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:06.020]   The Olympics is in like a year.
[02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:07.340]   Like, let's talk about this again
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:08.900]   'cause it's the second time I've tried to quit
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:10.740]   in like two years, right?
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:14.940]   So then we sit down in Jimmy's office and he's like,
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:16.740]   whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't quit.
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:19.300]   You're gonna kick yourself if you don't go to Rio.
[02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:22.180]   I'm telling you right now, don't do that to yourself.
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:23.820]   Let's figure out a way of like doing this.
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:27.060]   And I was like, because when we trained before,
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:29.140]   we did it at a unit, right?
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.560]   We all went to the same tournaments.
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:31.960]   We all went to the same training camps.
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.840]   And I'm like, you guys are treating me
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:36.080]   like I'm the same player I used to be.
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:38.420]   I go, I don't, I'm not operating
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:40.080]   at the level you think I'm operating at.
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:41.480]   I go, I can't do that.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:43.840]   And he goes, well, what do you wanna do?
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.360]   And I go, I'll tell you what, Jimmy,
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:46.500]   you know I'm being serious
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:48.240]   because my answer is something
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:49.680]   you'd never would have expected.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:52.600]   I go, why don't you just send me to Japan for three weeks?
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:54.600]   And he was like, really?
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:55.960]   I hated Japan.
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.300]   I refused to go there up until this point.
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:01.540]   But I was like, I have to get to a point
[02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:05.780]   where I can get so tired and get through it
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.940]   that like my Judo will come back
[02:28:07.940 --> 02:28:09.460]   and my body will learn again.
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:12.500]   - And when you say Japan, you mean the Kodokan?
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:14.060]   Like what's-- - Tokai.
[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:16.700]   - Tokai, is that the highest level of Judo?
[02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:18.820]   - It's one of the top colleges in the world, yeah.
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:21.320]   - And that's so you can go with the best people in the world.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.580]   You can go to war with them, top level, like strong players.
[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:27.220]   - Yeah, there's a lot of very strong players.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:29.540]   There's a lot of middle class players
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:32.100]   and there's a lot of volume of rounds.
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:35.100]   - So you value all of it, the middle class too, like the--
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:35.940]   - Because when you're tired,
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:38.360]   like you can't just train in areas
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:41.700]   where you're battling for every inch.
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:46.020]   At some point you have to be successful, right?
[02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:49.020]   So you still under duress and under strain
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:51.140]   and through exhaustion,
[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:53.780]   you still have to have the ability to score.
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.220]   Well, if you're training with the best people
[02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:56.100]   in the world all the time,
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:58.220]   you're not always going to be able to score.
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:00.340]   So you still need those B-level players
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:02.940]   in order to really develop again.
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:06.140]   - What is it like, if you can comment briefly
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:08.780]   on the training in Japan,
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:11.740]   what's it like to go into a different place?
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:14.100]   You probably don't speak the language that well.
[02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:17.060]   Like, is there an isolation aspect to it?
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:19.980]   Is it like purely about Judo now?
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:22.060]   - I really want it to be isolated,
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:24.740]   no training partners, no coaches.
[02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:27.020]   I wanted to get back to my roots
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.720]   and just learn how to fight again.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:32.500]   I don't want to figure out how to beat the German.
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:33.940]   I don't want to figure out
[02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:38.300]   how I can develop a new entry into my SAO
[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:41.340]   against whoever it may be.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:43.300]   It's not-- - You just want to fight hard.
[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:44.140]   - I just want to fight.
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:45.300]   Let me get back to fighting.
[02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:48.580]   Let me get back to like the root of who I am.
[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:49.940]   - What were those sessions like?
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.020]   What were we talking about?
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:51.980]   Five minute rounds?
[02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:53.300]   Like what, how many?
[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:57.020]   - Six minute rounds, 30 minute breaks, 14 rounds a session.
[02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:00.300]   - Sorry, what's the 30 minute break?
[02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:01.580]   - 30 second break.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:03.480]   - 30 second break. - 30 second break.
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:06.420]   - Sorry, what, 14?
[02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:07.260]   - 14 rounds.
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:08.220]   - 14 rounds.
[02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:09.620]   - Every day.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:10.600]   - Every day.
[02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:13.500]   - Five days a week,
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:17.340]   and then 11 or 12 rounds on Saturday,
[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:19.780]   plus weightlifting, plus running.
[02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:21.560]   - Plus weightlifting, plus running.
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:23.620]   So those are hard rounds.
[02:30:23.620 --> 02:30:25.380]   What's it feel like to go through that?
[02:30:25.380 --> 02:30:29.260]   So you have a bunch of, just a sea of black belts,
[02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:33.740]   Japan, I'm sure they're hunting you a little bit.
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:35.340]   - Depending on who you are.
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:36.540]   I was hunted a little bit.
[02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:39.700]   Like I didn't really struggle because of who I am.
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.820]   Them as college athletes,
[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:44.260]   they want to show to their coaches
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:47.140]   and their higher players like,
[02:30:47.140 --> 02:30:50.160]   oh, look, I can throw the world number whoever.
[02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.260]   But if you're just a guy who shows up,
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:56.060]   like them beating you doesn't provide any value
[02:30:56.060 --> 02:30:57.220]   or raise their status.
[02:30:57.220 --> 02:30:59.820]   - No, but you're status raising.
[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:00.980]   - Yes.
[02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:04.420]   So I was actually like in a situation
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.620]   where nobody was watching me
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:09.260]   and I was free to just battle at my own will.
[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.260]   - Okay.
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:12.580]   - Which is what it was about for me.
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:14.380]   - And you just push yourself.
[02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:15.660]   - 'Cause I knew how to do that.
[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.980]   I know how to push myself.
[02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:19.980]   - Are you, when you're doing these 14 rounds,
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.600]   is every single one a standalone thing for you?
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:24.440]   - Yep.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:25.800]   - So you're not trying to pace yourself?
[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:26.640]   - Nope.
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:29.680]   Each one is to as much exhaustion as I can get.
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:33.280]   - But then there must be ones where like it's like round nine
[02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:35.160]   where you're got nothing left.
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:36.800]   - Better figure out how to score.
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:38.320]   It's all you gotta do.
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.160]   You gotta survive and you gotta score.
[02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:44.400]   - What's your memories of that, of those three weeks?
[02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:46.800]   What's like, what stands out to you?
[02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:47.640]   It seems like,
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.140]   'cause that's the place where you found the silver medal.
[02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:51.980]   - Yeah.
[02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:56.140]   Because it's the place most people don't want to be.
[02:31:56.140 --> 02:31:59.380]   Everybody's comfortable.
[02:31:59.380 --> 02:32:03.940]   I would rather find out who I am and what I'm made of
[02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:06.340]   and find those end points.
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:08.420]   And if I can't find them,
[02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:11.740]   then that means everybody else has given up before me.
[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:17.060]   - Were there a few people that just kind of,
[02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:20.020]   you returned to battle over and over in those times
[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:21.660]   and then it was just.
[02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:22.500]   - Yep.
[02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:25.900]   - No social media.
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:26.720]   - Nope.
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:28.460]   - None of that is just like two men.
[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:30.940]   - You lock yourself in your room, you come back,
[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:32.620]   you've thought about it
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:35.500]   and you come back with a game plan for that day
[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:37.620]   against some players here or there.
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:40.860]   And I would develop a hit list.
[02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:41.800]   Like I would be like,
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:44.620]   oh, that motherfucker grabbed me at like 13
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:46.480]   and I watched him sit fucking four rounds
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:48.300]   and then come try to kick the shit out of me.
[02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:49.580]   I'm gonna fucking grab that guy early
[02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:51.660]   and I'm gonna beat the shit out of him.
[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.260]   And you just develop that list.
[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:55.620]   - There's probably some epic battles in that room, right?
[02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:56.460]   - Yeah.
[02:32:56.460 --> 02:32:58.740]   - What's it look like?
[02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:00.100]   Like how crowded is it?
[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:01.140]   - Very.
[02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:02.700]   - And so you're just like.
[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:04.100]   - Yeah, it's a sea of people.
[02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:05.180]   - Sea of people.
[02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:06.940]   And you're trying to, are you doing groundwork at all?
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:07.780]   Just throws.
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:08.700]   - Just throws.
[02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:10.060]   No transitions, no nothing.
[02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:12.220]   But if I get pissed off and like you keep dropping
[02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:14.060]   or like not letting me do what I want to do,
[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:16.060]   I'll rip a choke right across your face.
[02:33:16.060 --> 02:33:18.140]   Just to let you know that like,
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:18.980]   again, if I wanted to.
[02:33:18.980 --> 02:33:21.980]   - You have a really nice style of just like
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:26.780]   respectfully bullying the shit out of people.
[02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:28.260]   - 'Cause some people call me a bully
[02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:30.300]   and I have to remind them that like
[02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:34.660]   a bully enjoys like beating up the weak.
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:35.500]   - Right.
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:38.060]   - I wanna beat the person that fights back.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:38.900]   - Right, exactly.
[02:33:38.900 --> 02:33:40.980]   - It's not fun for me if you don't fight back.
[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:41.820]   - Right.
[02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:44.620]   Some of the greatest people I've seen like do this,
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:48.620]   they basically, you have this in the Iowa wrestling rooms,
[02:33:48.620 --> 02:33:49.940]   they'll push each other into the wall.
[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:51.720]   Like they get, there's like anger,
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:53.580]   but it's ultimately underneath it all,
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:55.220]   it's like a deep respect.
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:57.420]   - I was training with Colton Brown one time
[02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:58.920]   and I went to San Jose State
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:01.460]   'cause I was in California for something.
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:04.580]   And he kept like, he kept circling to the edge.
[02:34:04.580 --> 02:34:06.580]   They had like a cupboard that had like,
[02:34:06.580 --> 02:34:08.580]   when you opened it, it had like all the tape
[02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:09.500]   and like medical supplies.
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.900]   I was like, we'll fucking put you right through that.
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:13.660]   And he kind of giggled.
[02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:14.580]   And then he went by that edge
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:15.820]   and I fucking ran him right through it.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:19.060]   - Yeah, see, to me, that's an ultimate sign of respect
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:21.860]   that both you and Colton will remember well.
[02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:23.340]   - And we're still friends, we still talk.
[02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:24.820]   It's just, I told him I was gonna do it.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:26.460]   He knew I meant it too.
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:27.840]   He did it anyways.
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.920]   That just tested me.
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:35.980]   - Yeah, listen, that's, and that same attitude was,
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:39.660]   that was in Japan just day after day, after day, after day.
[02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:42.140]   14 rounds, that's rough.
[02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:44.340]   - And you didn't sit out rounds?
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.240]   - And I did it all with a broken hand.
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:48.860]   - How?
[02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:52.500]   How did you do it with a broken hand?
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:53.780]   - You show up every day.
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:54.940]   - You show up, okay.
[02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:56.340]   - I actually did. - Which one, left or right?
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:57.660]   - My right.
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:58.620]   - Okay, so that's okay.
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:01.580]   So you can then focus on gripping with your left.
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:02.820]   - It's always a way.
[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:04.100]   - It's always a way.
[02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:04.980]   But that means you can't,
[02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.100]   I guess you don't have to grip with your right sometimes.
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:08.900]   - I would palm it with my thumb,
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:11.540]   just like hanging out like this, just like this.
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:12.740]   So you can do something.
[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:15.040]   So you can do like a goshi, 'cause you have a,
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:16.940]   'cause I--
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:17.820]   - What were your main throws?
[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:19.100]   It was Seinagi.
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:20.540]   - Koshigeruma.
[02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:21.380]   - Okay.
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:23.020]   - Sumi, Uchimata.
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:24.720]   - Uchimata, but you have this big,
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:28.460]   like a goshi type of thing, like a--
[02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:30.740]   - Yeah, but not from like around the waist.
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:32.220]   It's from over the shoulder.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:33.060]   - Over the shoulder.
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:35.500]   - And I can do it with just the one hand.
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:36.980]   - Oh, sorry, which one hand?
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:38.180]   - The right one.
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:39.740]   I don't need the sleeve hand.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:40.680]   - You don't need the sleeve hand,
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:42.860]   but you couldn't do it with the broken hand.
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:45.900]   - I could, 'cause I can just put my hand in the gi
[02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:47.160]   so it can't come off.
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:52.020]   And then you just, 'cause what happened was
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:54.100]   three days before I was leaving for Japan,
[02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:57.140]   a guy, my hand was rested like this on a mat
[02:35:57.140 --> 02:35:59.820]   and the guy, boom, took my whole thumb off
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.460]   and tore all the tendons in the palm.
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.560]   So when I went to the doctor, he was like,
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:06.620]   "We have to put a cast on it."
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:08.420]   And I go, "I'm leaving in three days.
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:10.260]   You're not putting a cast on it."
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:11.900]   And I go, "This is what I want you to do."
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:12.820]   Just like this, I said,
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:16.300]   "I want you to build a cast that holds it,
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:19.900]   that Velcros around so that when I'm not training,
[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:21.260]   I can wear it.
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:23.820]   But then when I'm training, I'll take it off
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:25.220]   and then I'll put the tape on it
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:27.100]   and then whatever happens, happens."
[02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:31.420]   - Whatever happens, happens.
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:33.340]   All right, so that's epic.
[02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:37.300]   And that led you to the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
[02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:39.740]   - Well, that led me to winning Pan Am gold
[02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:41.300]   when I got back from Japan
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:44.360]   and then almost getting my leg cut off in 2015.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:49.420]   That was like, I don't know, maybe a month or two later.
[02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:51.700]   I was hospitalized for seven days.
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:53.600]   - The leg being cut off for what?
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:56.160]   - I had three different types of bacterial infections
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:57.340]   in my right leg.
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:01.740]   My whole leg swelled and it was in my blood,
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:05.040]   skin and in my bone, in my right leg.
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:11.940]   So I got stuck at MGH in a hospital for seven days
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:15.940]   until they figured out what the bacteria source was.
[02:37:15.940 --> 02:37:17.780]   - Where was the source of the infection?
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:19.660]   As in in the knee?
[02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:20.500]   - Yeah.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:23.420]   - Okay, so obviously there's a danger of like,
[02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:24.620]   that's life threatening.
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:26.940]   - Yep, so when I went into the emergency room,
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:28.700]   when I got back from the Worlds,
[02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:30.900]   the lady was like, "Hey, you need to call,
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.180]   you're gonna call 'cause you may lose your leg tonight."
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:36.020]   And then they put me in the hospital.
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:38.260]   - What do you think in this whole time?
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:40.460]   Are you still thinking about Olympics?
[02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:42.020]   - They put me into the room,
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.740]   like four hours later, the doctor came in.
[02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:49.460]   I was at MGH in Boston.
[02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:53.100]   And he was like, "You have a serious infection in your leg."
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:56.100]   I go, he's like, "We have to keep you hospitalized
[02:37:56.100 --> 02:37:57.380]   until we can figure out what it is."
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:00.420]   And I was like, "Buddy, I have the Olympic games
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:01.380]   in less than a year."
[02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:03.620]   I go, "I don't give a fuck what it is."
[02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.700]   I go, "Just fucking take it out
[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:06.860]   and let me get on with my day."
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:08.980]   And he goes, "We can't do that."
[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:10.620]   Like, I don't understand.
[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:12.300]   I go, "You told me it's infected,
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.620]   just cut away that part of the tissue,
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:16.060]   drain it, do whatever you gotta do,
[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:17.380]   and then send me on my way."
[02:38:17.380 --> 02:38:18.980]   He's like, "It doesn't work like that."
[02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:20.700]   He said, "Until we figure out what it is,
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:22.900]   we can't figure out how to stop it from growing
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:24.420]   or how far it spread."
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:27.700]   So it took him seven days to figure out what it was.
[02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:29.500]   Then once they figured out what it was,
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.540]   I went in for surgery to remove it.
[02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:35.620]   Then I spent, I think it was eight weeks
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:38.460]   in in-home care with a PICC line.
[02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:41.580]   And then I came back from that,
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:43.380]   on the first week and a half of judo,
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:46.860]   I tore my SI joint trying to throw a guy.
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:49.940]   And then I came back from that about a month later,
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:52.460]   and then fifth at the Cono Cup.
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:54.300]   And then the games six months later.
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:56.220]   - How quickly do doctors understand
[02:38:56.220 --> 02:38:57.940]   who they're dealing with?
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:38:59.940]   Like, is that difficult for you to explain
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:02.780]   who Travis Stevens is when you go to visit a doctor?
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:07.140]   - I don't think they understand, you know,
[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:10.620]   their role is to get me to do my job
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:13.900]   to the best of their ability as a doctor.
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:16.260]   Meaning it's gonna be less than what they want.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:22.400]   And they struggle conceptually with like,
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:26.300]   but the textbook tells me this.
[02:39:26.300 --> 02:39:28.420]   And I go, "But I'm not a textbook."
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:30.460]   Right, like when you go to physical therapy,
[02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:32.620]   the first thing they do is they pull out that binder
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:35.500]   that says, "Day one, we do this exercise."
[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:38.660]   I go, "But I have my own goals.
[02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:41.240]   "Your job is to help me meet my goal.
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:43.080]   "Let's work a plan to do that,
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:45.300]   "or I gotta go find somebody else."
[02:39:45.300 --> 02:39:47.140]   - Did the doctors in general,
[02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:50.140]   people outside of your close-knit group step up?
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:52.900]   - If they didn't, I found somebody else.
[02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:55.780]   And typically I could find a person
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:57.420]   who knew the right person.
[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:00.220]   - I always wonder with people,
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:02.820]   'cause I'm constantly surrounded by,
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:04.820]   one of the biggest problems in my life has been,
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:07.980]   there's a lot of people in my life who love me very much,
[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:11.280]   but who want me to the equivalent of that situation.
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:14.580]   You know, definitely don't go to the Olympics.
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:16.100]   And definitely like,
[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:18.080]   it seems like the world is full of people
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:21.340]   that want you to be average and happy.
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:22.220]   - Yes. - Which is great.
[02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:23.060]   Which is fine.
[02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:25.620]   I mean, perhaps that's the way it should be.
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:27.360]   Like, you know, my parents, people close to you,
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.780]   that's how love manifests itself often in people.
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:35.220]   But then like, I think the ultimate manifestation of love
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:37.220]   is understanding who this person is.
[02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:40.380]   Here's a madman who's driven towards a particular thing.
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:43.640]   And the best thing for you to do is not to say,
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:48.500]   like, rest, it's to say, work harder.
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:52.740]   Like, fuck your infection.
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:54.060]   You should be training.
[02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:57.300]   Have you ever met anybody as crazy as you
[02:40:57.300 --> 02:40:58.460]   that can help you?
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:02.080]   - Most of us who get to this point get there
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:05.360]   because we're all a little unstable.
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:06.200]   - Yeah.
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.440]   - Even my wife, Kalita, right?
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:11.020]   Like when she was getting ready for 2016,
[02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:13.920]   or when she was getting ready for 2020,
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:16.960]   'cause she moved to Boston to be a coach,
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:21.960]   she had a neck problem, right?
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:26.960]   And at some point in time, it's like,
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:31.860]   what's really important, day-to-day life or judo?
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:35.800]   And believe it or not, the doctor in Canada was like,
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:39.520]   I am never under any circumstances
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:41.160]   doing an MRI of your neck again.
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:44.120]   That's what she told her.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.160]   She goes, if you have me do an MRI,
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:47.440]   you're not doing judo again.
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:51.200]   So just know, if you hurt your neck and it requires an MRI,
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.580]   you're done with judo forever.
[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:54.420]   - Yeah.
[02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:56.360]   - So decide if you wanna do judo or not.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:59.040]   That was a conversation we actually had to have.
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:01.820]   - That's a cool thing for a doctor to say.
[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:05.320]   I mean, it depends how bad ass they sound when they say it.
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:08.080]   So that's a tough conversation, judo one.
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.920]   What's this with your wife?
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:11.160]   What's that relationship like?
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:13.240]   So you're both a little crazy.
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.080]   - A little bit.
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.040]   - In a good sense, or from my perspective, in a good sense.
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.560]   - Yeah, it's just, we understand that when it,
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:26.200]   when you set a goal to do something,
[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:28.160]   you're not signing on for the good.
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:31.440]   You're signing on for the bad.
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:34.160]   And I don't think a lot of people understand that.
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:37.200]   - That's like a Valentine's Day card from Travis Stevens.
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:40.800]   - You have to like accept everything negative
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:42.480]   that could possibly happen.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.560]   And until you do, you're never gonna make it
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.920]   'cause you'll always sell yourself short.
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:48.280]   You'll never go far enough.
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:50.760]   - And if you sign up for the whole thing,
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:53.240]   then the negative is just like, oh, great.
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:54.560]   - I expected that.
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:56.240]   - If you're experiencing the negative,
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:58.200]   they're also experiencing the negative.
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:01.000]   And if you overcome it, maybe they'll get knocked out.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.760]   - Yep, maybe they won't deal with it.
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:05.200]   Maybe they won't train through it.
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:06.960]   Right, when I had my five herniated disc
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:07.960]   and I was in a neck brace,
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:09.560]   I was still in the gym at 7 a.m.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:12.320]   Doing whatever it is I could do
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:15.040]   because my job is to be at the gym.
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:17.200]   - David Goggins, I don't know if you know the guy,
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.640]   he's gone, he's damaged lots of parts of his body like you,
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:23.160]   trying to achieve things.
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:28.080]   So, unlike you, his achievements are like,
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:29.880]   your achievements come with the medal.
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:32.480]   He's just running in the darkness
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.400]   in the middle of nowhere by himself.
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:36.960]   It's like, I mean, it's the same probably as with you
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:39.340]   if you're able to be introspective about it,
[02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:41.920]   is he's just battling his own inner demons
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:44.080]   and working through those
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:47.680]   and is breaking his body doing so.
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.280]   Are you cognizant of the trade-off of the fact
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.880]   that you're damaging your body
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:57.880]   to get to these levels of achievements,
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:00.760]   of this level of excellence, of this level of greatness?
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.560]   - I mean, I guess that depends
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:04.360]   on what you consider damage really
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:08.160]   'cause I don't really see that I have damaged my body.
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:10.560]   If anything, I think I've strengthened it.
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:12.680]   My body can go through more than yours can.
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:13.720]   Whose is weaker?
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:14.560]   - Yeah.
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:20.000]   - Right, it's just like the Thai boxers, right?
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.280]   In order to strengthen their shins,
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:22.720]   they got to break it a few times.
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:23.560]   - Yeah.
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:24.600]   - It's just nature of the beast.
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:26.800]   - You just had to break a bunch of stuff
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:28.240]   to find where the weak points are
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:29.600]   and then made them stronger.
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:30.440]   - Yeah.
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:32.600]   - Or strengthen the areas around it to strengthen it
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.120]   by the sheer relation to it.
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:38.920]   - But the problem is like you may not be able to do judo
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:43.520]   like for until you're 70.
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:45.700]   - Why not?
[02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:48.000]   I may not be able to do judo to the level I used to.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.020]   - Yeah. - Don't get me wrong,
[02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:50.400]   but I can still do judo.
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:51.240]   - You can still do judo.
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:53.980]   - And I think a lot of people struggle with,
[02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:57.280]   they wanna keep doing it like they used to be able to do it.
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:59.000]   I don't try to do judo like I used to,
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.480]   like you're seeing here.
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:02.660]   I'm not that guy anymore.
[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:03.680]   I accept that.
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:05.720]   I don't even try to be that guy anymore.
[02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:08.760]   I'm a completely different player today
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:11.340]   than I am when I was winning Olympic medals.
[02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:18.920]   And so I guess when you're looking at like my journey
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:22.900]   and the trade-off is I never sacrificed anything.
[02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:26.560]   The people around me sacrificed for me.
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.880]   And I never had a downturn after the Olympics
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:33.420]   because I never identified as an Olympian.
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:38.280]   - You know, a lot of Olympians suffer from depression
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:40.280]   after World Cup and stuff. - Because they identify as it.
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:42.460]   Now they don't have who they are.
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:46.920]   - Where was your personal moment of greatness?
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:49.760]   Like, or do you not experience life that way?
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:52.120]   Where you were truly proud to be yourself?
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:53.680]   Like- - Every day I wake up.
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:56.680]   - You're, uh- - You wake up
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:57.840]   and you're not proud of who you are,
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:01.440]   then you've really got to seek out some like help.
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:03.920]   - So that's, first of all, okay, I'll do that
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.320]   because I definitely am not proud of who I am.
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:11.200]   I just wonder if you didn't identify with the Olympics,
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:14.040]   was there times maybe in the training room,
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.080]   maybe in Japan, like where you were,
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:22.080]   you just kind of felt like- - I get more of an emotional,
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.280]   I guess, trigger, right?
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:27.480]   Where like I feel proud of what I've done
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:32.400]   when I've set to a task and I've done it.
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:35.120]   - So almost any task.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.620]   - And the more challenging the task, the more reward.
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:44.880]   You fought a lot of amazing battles in 2016 Olympics.
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:48.000]   So you got, you beat the, let's see,
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:51.680]   the world number four in the quarterfinals.
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:53.720]   It's like a replay, every single Olympics,
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:56.800]   all the people- - I got terrible draws.
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:58.280]   - It's insane. - Terrible draws.
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:46:59.360]   - And then you're facing,
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:00.640]   this is where I was like watching this,
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:02.080]   I'm like, yeah, he's screwed.
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.480]   You faced the world number one, the Georgian.
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:07.360]   - By the way, for people who don't know,
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:11.640]   he beat me five times to my beating him once.
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:13.920]   And the one time I beat him was in London.
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.640]   And all other times he beat me, he beat me by a pwn.
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:19.800]   And not by like a little throw,
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:22.020]   like he threw me on my head.
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:25.460]   At one point we were in Georgia,
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:27.080]   I'm fighting him in the final.
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:29.280]   I go to my teammate and I go, guess what?
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:30.560]   Make sure you watch this fight.
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.360]   Somebody's getting thrown free pwn.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:34.760]   This match ain't, this ain't match going to distance.
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:37.680]   And about a minute in, I tried to take his head off
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:40.540]   with a big Koshi Guruma, which is like a head and arm.
[02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:42.920]   He caught me and then threw me on my head
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.080]   and ended the match.
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.400]   - So first of all, we're watching the video of you,
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.600]   again, standing next to the guy
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:52.680]   leading up to your semifinal match.
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.600]   So here, if you win this, you're guaranteed a medal.
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:59.440]   But the chances of you winning from my fan perspective,
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:00.540]   I was like, goddammit.
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:03.680]   - You and the rest of the world except for me.
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:04.520]   - Except for you.
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:05.360]   - What are you saying?
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:07.080]   You're talking to yourself here.
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.120]   What are you saying?
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:09.760]   - My name is Travis Stevens.
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:10.960]   I'm Olympic champion.
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.240]   I will not be denied.
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:15.560]   - The Georgia is probably like,
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.800]   what the hell is this guy saying?
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:19.300]   What is he talking to himself?
[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:22.380]   So he was probably ultra confident.
[02:48:22.380 --> 02:48:24.400]   - Yeah, had to be.
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:26.960]   The difference is, is I understood
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:29.240]   the last five times he beat me,
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:32.420]   I was purposely trying to throw him, not beat him.
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:35.080]   I wanted to find out if I could.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:36.900]   Turns out I can't.
[02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:40.680]   But I don't need to throw him to beat him.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:42.520]   I need to know how to not lose.
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:47.880]   - But you were still going for stuff here.
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:51.320]   - But all of my attacks drag him to the ground.
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:53.080]   They're never standing on my feet,
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:57.640]   which is a distinction that we talked about
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:48:59.040]   at the very beginning, right?
[02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:00.260]   You have throws where you're standing
[02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:01.680]   and throws where you're dropping.
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:04.280]   Every time I try to throw him standing,
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:05.400]   he throws me free pony,
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:08.480]   picks me up and he throws me on my head, literally.
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:10.320]   So what I did is I just needed to get
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.000]   to that last one minute mark,
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.720]   which is what he does mentally in his own judo,
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:16.840]   where he changes into a panic
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.540]   and just tries to do things that are uncharacteristic.
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:23.600]   - So you knew he's gonna start panicking here
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.240]   as the match draws to a close
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:29.640]   and you both have a shido or penalty.
[02:49:29.640 --> 02:49:31.640]   - Did we pass the point where I went for broke
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:32.680]   and I broke my rule?
[02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:34.920]   - Which one?
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.400]   - I went for a crazy foot sweep,
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:42.480]   like Ippon switch thing.
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:43.800]   I can't even remember what it's called
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:45.480]   'cause it's not used that often.
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:47.660]   And he actually landed on top of me
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:50.480]   and some people wanted it to be called Ippon,
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:53.240]   but he had actually let go of the gi
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:54.400]   and was looking for the mat.
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:55.640]   So he didn't have any control.
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:57.280]   So they didn't award him a point.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:49:59.960]   - Yeah, and here we go.
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:00.960]   Now we're getting down into the,
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:02.440]   see, like he's getting frustrated.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:03.280]   Great.
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:04.100]   I love it.
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:06.100]   Perfect.
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:07.360]   Second penalty, no big deal.
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.440]   We just got to get to the one minute mark.
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:10.640]   That's all we got to do.
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.520]   - So there's no panic here for you.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:18.040]   - No, I'm right where I need to be and look at,
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:21.640]   now, if you go back into this match,
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:25.440]   I would love for somebody to go back
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:27.720]   and see how many times he did a drop,
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:29.880]   right Ippon Seinagi.
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:32.320]   Probably never.
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:33.160]   - Yeah.
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:34.320]   - So why is he doing it now?
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.320]   'Cause he panics and he changes his judo
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:39.520]   at that one minute mark.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:43.200]   Look how much I kept that grip.
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:46.760]   - Yeah, you have that grip this whole time.
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:48.080]   You have your left hand--
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:49.000]   - Walking him down.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.040]   - Walking him down.
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:54.840]   You keep the grip as he's throwing.
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:50:58.800]   Were you thinking choke as he drops or no?
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.440]   It's just kind of natural instinct.
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.120]   - Yeah, 'cause we drilled it.
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:04.320]   I spent two years drilling this transition.
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.360]   - And then very, so for people that don't do judo,
[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:10.120]   jiu-jitsu, it's like really nice.
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:12.560]   Everything is nicely controlled
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:15.080]   to where you're keeping that gi under his chin.
[02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:16.640]   Like it's really tight control.
[02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:19.240]   I guess it's drilling,
[02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:20.840]   but you're cognizant of the position
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:21.920]   of your wrist the whole time.
[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:25.760]   - And you can tell based on just years of doing it,
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:27.880]   whether it's under or it's not.
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:29.720]   You can just feel the difference.
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:32.200]   - And it's probably, even if you wanted to stop that,
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.800]   it's very difficult 'cause your whole time, it's like--
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:37.300]   - Once it's under, it's almost impossible to stop.
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:41.200]   - For people who practice jiu-jitsu, don't practice judo,
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:44.600]   one of the very annoying things about judo
[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:47.440]   is in order to do gi chokes,
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:48.840]   they have to be under the chin.
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:50.220]   - Yes.
[02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:52.480]   - Even though the kind of intense chokes you do
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:54.360]   work just fine over the chin.
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:55.860]   But--
[02:51:55.860 --> 02:51:59.400]   - And the kicker here and why we practice this choke
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:00.760]   was because when you go back
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:02.720]   and watch all of the other matches,
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:06.220]   he always does this tripod when I try to do arm locks,
[02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:08.040]   which is typically what I would do.
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:10.360]   And when I do that, he ends up sliding out
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:12.360]   and I end up falling off.
[02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:14.840]   - So you step up here with the choke.
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:18.160]   He does a tripod where he sticks his button to the air
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:23.160]   and you, dude, what's the name of this choke?
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:24.800]   - Bow and arrow.
[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:25.880]   - No, but okay.
[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:29.120]   But I mean, when you do from like from that position,
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:32.720]   is there a way this entry into the bow and arrow, I guess?
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:33.560]   'Cause you're doing--
[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:35.880]   - We refer to judo as a British triangle.
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:36.720]   - British triangle.
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:38.240]   - When they're in that turtle position
[02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:39.920]   and you do that rolling motion.
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:41.480]   - Cool.
[02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:43.880]   And here, when you go into that,
[02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:45.600]   you can fall off of him, like you said,
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:47.240]   if you're going for an arm bar.
[02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:49.120]   But here, literally,
[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:51.360]   because you have it under the chin really well,
[02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.300]   there's just a nice control.
[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:56.720]   And I've already planned on it being on his chin.
[02:52:56.720 --> 02:52:58.240]   That's why I've hooked the arm.
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:52:59.080]   - Yeah.
[02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:00.320]   - Right, it's already starting to go straight.
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:03.620]   - Probably this choke in the early stages,
[02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:04.840]   like a few frames before,
[02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:09.680]   feels like you're safe.
[02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:11.400]   It's fine.
[02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:13.800]   Like the head will slip out or something like that.
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:16.960]   - Yeah, and that's why my left knee is up by his shoulder
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:20.740]   to keep that pressure down so that he can't posture it up.
[02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:25.960]   - When did you know you have this?
[02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:27.160]   - Oh, it was right here.
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:29.120]   (laughing)
[02:53:29.120 --> 02:53:34.120]   I actually panicked right about here.
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:39.040]   - Was maybe his head could come out?
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:42.080]   - My hand, I tore the muscle in my palm
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:44.520]   because I was pulling so hard that I'm like,
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:47.360]   he may not tap.
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:48.200]   - Yeah.
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:52.180]   - Is my hand just going to give out beforehand?
[02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:53.020]   - And there he is.
[02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:54.820]   - And we're right on this edge, right?
[02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:55.660]   - Yeah.
[02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:57.060]   - So if we roll a little bit outside
[02:53:57.060 --> 02:53:59.740]   and I still don't have it, that ref could stop it.
[02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:00.580]   - Yeah.
[02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:01.900]   - And then I felt him tapping.
[02:54:01.900 --> 02:54:08.140]   - Oh, he's heartbroken.
[02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:08.980]   - I felt--
[02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:10.260]   - Surprised.
[02:54:10.260 --> 02:54:11.340]   There it is.
[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:14.180]   The relief.
[02:54:14.180 --> 02:54:15.100]   - Olympic final.
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:22.040]   And he knew, he knew he lost an Olympic medal right there
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:24.920]   because he already knew that the Japanese guy
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:27.740]   was going to be his bronze, that he never beats.
[02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:34.640]   - See the, but also he probably in his head
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:37.520]   was confident that he would be in the final.
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:38.600]   - Correct.
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:41.760]   - And so like this, he almost is surprised.
[02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:42.880]   - Yeah.
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:45.120]   - It's not supposed to happen this way.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:47.120]   - And it's the second time it's happened.
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:51.180]   (inhales deeply)
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:54.820]   - And that's how you became an Olympic medalist.
[02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:56.520]   Man, that must be a great feeling.
[02:54:56.520 --> 02:54:59.460]   That must be a great feeling right here.
[02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:04.340]   Just like all the years of injuries, all of it.
[02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:10.620]   As fans that watch this too, it's like,
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:11.980]   holy shit, he actually did it.
[02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:13.980]   - It's a packed stadium too.
[02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:15.200]   Not one empty seat.
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:18.100]   - Oh man.
[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:21.420]   So, what were you thinking here?
[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:23.620]   - I was--
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:24.440]   - You just focused on the next match?
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:25.620]   - Yeah.
[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:30.620]   It took me maybe like a minute or so to like decompress
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:35.960]   and then like get back to like my normal state
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:36.800]   for the final.
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:44.340]   - So the final is against the Russian here.
[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:47.340]   What can you say about your mindset?
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.260]   (laughs)
[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:50.420]   You're saying the exact same thing.
[02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:51.740]   - Same thing.
[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:54.380]   Travis Stevens, Olympic champion.
[02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:55.620]   I will not be denied.
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:59.420]   Because I had felt like in London and throughout the years,
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:02.580]   I felt like I kept getting robbed.
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:04.780]   So I made sure in my mantra to add that little bit
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:07.800]   at the end to reassure myself that like,
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:10.660]   they are not gonna control the outcome of today.
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.360]   I'm gonna control the outcome.
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:14.280]   - What did you know about the Russian?
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:15.120]   - Everything.
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:20.480]   And I honestly, I thought I had won the Olympics right now.
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:22.560]   And I still do think that today.
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:26.200]   Just like mentally when you think about it,
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:31.200]   that I've won like, yeah, he threw me.
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:35.640]   But it was like a one in a million chance
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:37.640]   that that worked for him.
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:38.600]   Like, come on.
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:42.480]   - So it's not like you feel lucky to be in the final.
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:43.400]   It's like--
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:47.880]   - Again, remember I'm anticipating the goal.
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:49.500]   Like I'm past that.
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:52.160]   - There's a confidence in the way you're moving
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:53.000]   and the way you're--
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.460]   - Yeah, like I have his sleeve.
[02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:55.440]   He's not breaking it.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.880]   Like still walking him down, still going forward.
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:02.540]   Like I knew exactly how I was gonna beat him.
[02:57:02.540 --> 02:57:06.500]   And I developed a plan because when I was getting ready
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:10.920]   for Rio, we brought in a lot of the top Japanese players
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:13.960]   that weren't invited to the camp for the national team
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:14.800]   to Boston.
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:17.040]   So I had four people, three of them were on the national
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:20.880]   team, one of them had won the universities in Japan,
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:22.180]   all at 81 kilos.
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:25.520]   I only got thrown once during camp for a month.
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:26.480]   - Wow.
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:29.120]   - Like I was ready.
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:33.920]   I just, I fucking slipped.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:36.720]   - Where does it happen?
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:37.820]   - Right when he threw me.
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:39.820]   So if you let this play out really quick,
[02:57:39.820 --> 02:57:42.400]   there's a point right here where I'm gonna come around
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:46.840]   his back and I'm kind of gonna just yoko suteme,
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:48.480]   which means like a lateral drop.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:50.400]   And I'm just gonna bring him down to the floor,
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]   which isn't a throw right here.
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.520]   It's more of like a takedown, right?
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:55.880]   I'm trying to get him to the ground
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:57.180]   'cause I wanna burn him.
[02:57:57.180 --> 02:57:58.960]   He doesn't do any waza.
[02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:00.240]   So I'm just gonna keep burning him.
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:04.140]   And you can see that like, I get really close here.
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:08.320]   He just went a little too far to his side
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:09.680]   during this exchange.
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:12.400]   And like, he's running.
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:13.240]   I'm like, ah.
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:20.120]   He's very wiry for an 81 kg player.
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:22.500]   Yeah, there's not much like muscle on him,
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:26.080]   but he uses his length and his leverage very well.
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:28.160]   And you can see like, I'm really burning the clock here.
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:31.400]   Like I'm owning these exchanges more than I'm owning
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:33.600]   the tachi waza ones, the ones in our feet.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:36.320]   So you weren't trying to necessarily like submit him here
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:40.840]   or like really hard or like pin him.
[02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:43.240]   You were trying to break him a bit.
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:44.880]   I'm doing both.
[02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.600]   I'm being overly physical.
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:51.240]   And to a lot of the BJJ people who are watching this,
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:54.120]   like, they're like, oh, I would have done this.
[02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:55.020]   I would have done that.
[02:58:55.020 --> 02:58:58.800]   You've got to think like, if that referee
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:00.200]   who's reffing the judo side of it
[02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:02.600]   looks at it for a couple of seconds and is like,
[02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:05.120]   he's not really moving.
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:06.220]   They'll stop it.
[02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:07.060]   - Yeah.
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:09.960]   So you're like, you understand judo.
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:10.800]   - Yeah.
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:12.040]   - What's called nae waza groundwork.
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:14.920]   Like what you, 'cause you're really showing it to the ref.
[02:59:14.920 --> 02:59:15.760]   - Yes.
[02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:17.960]   You have to show movement and progression.
[02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:20.600]   I hurt the forehead.
[02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:23.440]   Like, see, I threw that hand in there kind of hard,
[02:59:23.440 --> 02:59:25.840]   ripping it across his face just because.
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:32.440]   - I gotta tell you, there's a calm, well, no,
[02:59:32.440 --> 02:59:35.120]   he does look a little broken,
[02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:38.340]   but the Russians have like this calmness
[02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:40.860]   they're pretty good at.
[02:59:40.860 --> 02:59:42.940]   - Well, don't forget, they've competed like this
[02:59:42.940 --> 02:59:44.300]   for a long time.
[02:59:44.300 --> 02:59:45.620]   Yeah, it's all he knows.
[02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:48.700]   And this is where I lose it.
[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:50.220]   See how my knee hit the ground?
[02:59:50.220 --> 02:59:51.060]   - Yeah.
[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:52.020]   - My knee wasn't supposed to touch the ground.
[02:59:52.020 --> 02:59:53.100]   - Yeah.
[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:55.860]   - I was supposed to sit to my hip to bring him down.
[02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:58.140]   Something happened where my knee touched
[02:59:58.140 --> 03:00:00.420]   and it didn't happen in the first one.
[03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:01.580]   It just happened there.
[03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:04.540]   So like that, we never should have been
[03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:05.800]   in that predicament.
[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:07.160]   - Yeah.
[03:00:07.160 --> 03:00:10.060]   - And that's one of the things where
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:13.520]   when you're looking at sports for anybody
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:15.500]   who's trying to improve,
[03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:19.700]   you have to, when you're trying to improve,
[03:00:19.700 --> 03:00:23.780]   you've really got to ignore the ends of the spectrums.
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:24.620]   Right?
[03:00:24.620 --> 03:00:28.300]   The oopsies and the they got lucky.
[03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:29.820]   And you only focus on the middle.
[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:33.080]   Like the technique I was doing was perfectly sound.
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:36.180]   It just happened that the one oopsie happened
[03:00:36.180 --> 03:00:38.340]   on the stage it shouldn't have happened on.
[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:43.260]   And there's no amount of drilling
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:47.900]   that will ever prevent that from happening.
[03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:49.380]   - And that's just the--
[03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:50.260]   - That's sports.
[03:00:50.260 --> 03:00:52.060]   - That's sports, especially the Olympics,
[03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:54.060]   especially Judo when it's like one--
[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:54.900]   - You get one mistake.
[03:00:54.900 --> 03:00:56.860]   - Quote unquote oopsie can just be your--
[03:00:56.860 --> 03:00:57.940]   - That's it.
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:00:58.780]   - That's it.
[03:00:58.780 --> 03:01:00.220]   - You know, it really requires
[03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.760]   and you have to wrap your head around the idea of like,
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:04.820]   if you want the ability to beat these people
[03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:05.740]   and throw these people,
[03:01:05.740 --> 03:01:08.180]   like you got to be willing to get thrown yourself.
[03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:09.020]   - Yeah.
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:11.660]   - Like this isn't boxing.
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:13.580]   There's no like, I'm going to stand in a place
[03:01:13.580 --> 03:01:16.180]   where he can't hit me and I can hit him
[03:01:16.180 --> 03:01:18.860]   because we have the gi and because they can grab it,
[03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:21.660]   they have just as much ability to throw you as you them.
[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:24.340]   - So how'd you feel here?
[03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:26.620]   How long was the duration of you feeling upset
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:28.260]   that you didn't get the gold versus--
[03:01:28.260 --> 03:01:29.180]   - Never felt it.
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:30.020]   - Never felt it.
[03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:32.380]   Just--
[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:34.120]   - Because he didn't beat me.
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:34.960]   - Right.
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:36.020]   - Right, it's an important distinction
[03:01:36.020 --> 03:01:40.100]   because when I'm training and when I'm competing,
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:43.660]   like I understand that I take risk
[03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:46.660]   and I accept those consequences, that's why I take them.
[03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:48.540]   That's a consequence.
[03:01:48.540 --> 03:01:51.100]   That's not him being the better Judo player
[03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:54.660]   that dominated a match and I didn't have an answer
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:56.140]   and then he threw me.
[03:01:56.140 --> 03:01:58.280]   Then I would be a little upset.
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:00.420]   Like when you're tired and somebody's coming at you
[03:02:00.420 --> 03:02:02.900]   and like you can't do anything about it,
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:04.100]   that's a shitty feeling.
[03:02:04.100 --> 03:02:04.940]   - Yeah.
[03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:05.780]   - You know?
[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:06.620]   - And that wasn't this.
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:08.860]   - And that wasn't this.
[03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:13.000]   Like I accept losing when it's my fault.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:16.100]   - Well, that was a hell of a story, man.
[03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:21.100]   So from 2008, 2012, just the sheer number of injuries,
[03:02:21.100 --> 03:02:26.100]   the weight cuts, all of that, the wanting to quit,
[03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:31.020]   the doubts, I'm sure you did not get,
[03:02:31.020 --> 03:02:33.540]   like the fans probably started disappearing
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:35.740]   somewhere between the second and the third Olympics,
[03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:37.900]   like the support from--
[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:38.740]   - It did.
[03:02:38.740 --> 03:02:42.580]   - Judo within the United States and just everybody, you know.
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:46.060]   - Just like USOC tried to cut all my funding in 2015
[03:02:46.060 --> 03:02:48.640]   and said, "No, you're too old."
[03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:49.700]   - Yeah.
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:52.220]   So through all of that to win the medal,
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:55.140]   I mean, that's what the Olympics is about.
[03:02:55.140 --> 03:02:57.860]   Is there some, like when you look back,
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.620]   does that seem like another person?
[03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:01.420]   Is this like another lifetime ago?
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.540]   Or like that's a hell of an accomplishment.
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:05.440]   How do you feel about the whole thing?
[03:03:05.440 --> 03:03:11.260]   - It's an interesting kind of predicament
[03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:13.460]   because there's like those cookie cutter answers
[03:03:13.460 --> 03:03:15.780]   about how proud you are and how grateful you are,
[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:20.260]   but at the end of the day, it's not who you are.
[03:03:20.260 --> 03:03:23.660]   So that skill set and that mentality
[03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:28.660]   that it took to accomplish that, that's who you are.
[03:03:28.660 --> 03:03:34.220]   And so this was just a stepping stone in who I am.
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:37.260]   So it's in the past to me.
[03:03:37.260 --> 03:03:39.600]   Like there's no shrine in my house
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:41.780]   that has like an Olympic medal in it.
[03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:44.740]   I can't remember the last time I looked at it.
[03:03:44.740 --> 03:03:47.780]   - So you're saying like all the stories,
[03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:49.740]   the skills along the way,
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:53.100]   that's like you right now sitting here is the shrine.
[03:03:53.100 --> 03:03:56.340]   - Yeah, the who you become along the journey
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:59.380]   is really what the prize is, right?
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:02.900]   Like when you think about any of them,
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:06.740]   most of the people that go through that depression
[03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:10.940]   after the games, it's because that is their shrine.
[03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:13.100]   Like that is who they've identified as.
[03:04:13.100 --> 03:04:15.540]   That is who they've told the world,
[03:04:15.540 --> 03:04:18.180]   the community, their friends, their family.
[03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:19.680]   That's how they've identified.
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:23.220]   I've identified as a person who perseveres,
[03:04:23.220 --> 03:04:26.140]   overcomes and accepts challenges.
[03:04:26.140 --> 03:04:31.260]   So like all those things are just like,
[03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:33.900]   putting a suitcase off to the side
[03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:36.620]   and I'm onto the next great chapter thing
[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:37.720]   that I'm trying to do.
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:43.740]   - And it's both sad and cool that very few people
[03:04:43.740 --> 03:04:47.060]   in the world get to experience what it's like to be you.
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:50.420]   I mean, this level of having gone through that.
[03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:51.420]   - Yeah. - Journey.
[03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:54.260]   - Everyone has the opportunity to.
[03:04:54.260 --> 03:04:58.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:58.700 --> 03:05:03.460]   I mean, I've done a few difficult things in my life,
[03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:06.140]   but I gotta tell you, weight cuts and sauna.
[03:05:06.140 --> 03:05:09.900]   - And I would tell people right now who are listening,
[03:05:09.900 --> 03:05:12.120]   like don't go through that.
[03:05:12.120 --> 03:05:13.740]   And I think a lot of wrestlers,
[03:05:13.740 --> 03:05:16.340]   a lot of young judo players,
[03:05:16.340 --> 03:05:19.600]   a lot of long, young, like just combat sports people
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:22.180]   where weight classes are a thing.
[03:05:22.180 --> 03:05:25.620]   They almost take a sense of pride.
[03:05:25.620 --> 03:05:27.420]   Like when I hear them talking about like,
[03:05:27.420 --> 03:05:29.380]   oh, how much weight do you have to cut?
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:30.660]   If you have to cut a pound more,
[03:05:30.660 --> 03:05:33.060]   it's like you've accomplished more, like you're tougher.
[03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:35.100]   - Yeah. - Like you're not.
[03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:37.460]   Like there's no trophies for that.
[03:05:37.460 --> 03:05:41.180]   - You, whatever the reason, had a job to do
[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:42.060]   and you got it done.
[03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:46.340]   And that is truly inspiring, no matter how hard.
[03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:49.960]   That there's a big, deep lesson to learn from that.
[03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:51.600]   Then you start getting to the specifics
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:53.320]   of whether you should weight cut or not.
[03:05:53.320 --> 03:05:56.720]   But if we don't, then most of the great things
[03:05:56.720 --> 03:05:58.820]   we have in this world, we wouldn't have.
[03:05:58.820 --> 03:06:00.680]   The reason we have many of the great things
[03:06:00.680 --> 03:06:02.920]   is because people did that weight cut.
[03:06:02.920 --> 03:06:04.500]   The equivalent of the weight cut
[03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:06.500]   for whatever the discipline, man.
[03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:10.040]   - There's a difference between having to do it
[03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:12.600]   because you have to and you get through it,
[03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:15.800]   then setting yourself up to do that
[03:06:15.800 --> 03:06:18.640]   because you think it's the cool thing
[03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:20.240]   or the thing you're supposed to be doing
[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:22.280]   in order to be successful.
[03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:25.640]   There are plenty of like two-time Olympic medalist.
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:28.280]   I probably could have been a two-time Olympic medalist
[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:30.520]   had I not cut that much weight.
[03:06:30.520 --> 03:06:32.740]   I probably would have multiple world medals
[03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:33.960]   had I not cut that much weight
[03:06:33.960 --> 03:06:36.800]   'cause my body wouldn't have been that broken.
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:38.120]   There's always the other side of it.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:40.320]   So just when you're looking at it,
[03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:43.720]   like I just hear it in like young kids,
[03:06:43.720 --> 03:06:44.720]   even some of my own,
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:46.360]   like when you hear them talk about like
[03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:47.920]   where their weight's at,
[03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:49.480]   they almost take a sense of pride
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:51.200]   on how much they have to lose
[03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:53.560]   because they hear stories like this.
[03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:56.000]   And it's like, that's not the takeaway.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:59.040]   I did it because I had to.
[03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:01.580]   I was put in a situation where like,
[03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:03.040]   I may not have gone to this game
[03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:04.440]   had I moved up to 90 kilos
[03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:07.800]   'cause I wouldn't have had time to grow into the division.
[03:07:07.800 --> 03:07:09.080]   - And then you get the job done.
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:10.160]   - And then you get the job done.
[03:07:10.160 --> 03:07:11.000]   - You're right.
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:14.240]   It's just a very important difference.
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:16.840]   And that's also with sleep.
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:18.560]   That's what people talk to me about.
[03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:21.740]   There should not be any glorification of not sleeping.
[03:07:21.740 --> 03:07:24.840]   There should not be a glorification of cutting weight.
[03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:28.800]   But if that's on the way to your,
[03:07:28.800 --> 03:07:31.560]   whatever is that fire inside you
[03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:33.460]   that you know needs to get done,
[03:07:33.460 --> 03:07:35.160]   like the job at hand,
[03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.960]   if you need to sacrifice in some of those ways,
[03:07:37.960 --> 03:07:39.560]   you get the job done.
[03:07:39.560 --> 03:07:42.760]   Yeah, and the weight cut is an interesting one
[03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:43.800]   because it's different.
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:46.280]   I mean, you could speak to this.
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:48.920]   There's different sports in which the weight
[03:07:48.920 --> 03:07:50.360]   is more important than others.
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:52.840]   And there's different levels to this game.
[03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:54.960]   I think at the level you operated in,
[03:07:54.960 --> 03:07:57.160]   that was probably essential.
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:59.560]   Like there's huge games change completely
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:01.520]   from 81 kg to 90 kg.
[03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:02.840]   - It's a huge weight jump.
[03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:04.680]   - First of all, it's weight,
[03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:05.800]   but then the strategy,
[03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:07.600]   it's like so much changes the height
[03:08:07.600 --> 03:08:08.560]   and all those kinds of things.
[03:08:08.560 --> 03:08:11.060]   - The physical, like people don't understand it,
[03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:14.040]   but the physical size of a 90 kg Judo player
[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:17.320]   versus the physical size of an 81 kg Judo player,
[03:08:17.320 --> 03:08:19.160]   it's like putting a human in a human.
[03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:20.680]   Like there's enough space.
[03:08:20.680 --> 03:08:23.820]   It's not like, you could stand next to your friend
[03:08:23.820 --> 03:08:25.800]   who's 180 pounds and you could be 160
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:27.920]   and you guys could look identical.
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:31.280]   It is different when both the 90 kg, 100 kg and 81 kg
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:35.920]   both have 6% body fat and they're cutting into the class.
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:38.680]   - And it always feels like there's more variety at 90 kg
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:40.400]   'cause some of them are lanky and tall.
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:42.040]   - Yeah, some are short and stocky.
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:44.640]   - Stocky, it's like 81 is more uniform,
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:48.040]   which I, but then the flip side of that is the,
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:50.040]   this is why I like in Jiu Jitsu, again,
[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:53.320]   amateur competing against bigger guys.
[03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:54.280]   Like I love that more.
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:56.720]   I like cutting weight just so I'm slim.
[03:08:56.720 --> 03:08:57.760]   Like that's when I feel the best
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:08:59.480]   with the same thing that you mentioned.
[03:08:59.480 --> 03:09:03.560]   But like, I love going against 200, 220 that-
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:05.300]   - Because in Jiu Jitsu,
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:08.440]   the weight doesn't get amplified in the sport.
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:10.840]   Like the weight is just the weight, right?
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.840]   If you can leg press 220 and you can bench 220,
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:19.720]   then yeah, you can train with a guy who's 220.
[03:09:19.720 --> 03:09:20.660]   That's easy.
[03:09:20.660 --> 03:09:22.040]   They're not gonna hurt you.
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:25.040]   - And I mean, there is a truth that,
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:27.520]   lightweights and middleweights in Jiu Jitsu
[03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:29.580]   and the same is true for Judo.
[03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:31.200]   It's just like a lot more of them.
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:32.800]   That means if you wanna be,
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:37.240]   is you're just competing at a higher level.
[03:09:37.240 --> 03:09:40.400]   So like there's much more variety of games.
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:41.680]   The level is much higher.
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:43.860]   So you're taking on a bigger challenge,
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:47.400]   even if you're like have a weight advantage.
[03:09:47.400 --> 03:09:49.820]   So those are all decisions you have to kind of make.
[03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:51.240]   And certainly in Jiu Jitsu,
[03:09:51.240 --> 03:09:52.720]   people that are weight cutting are silly.
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:55.200]   I mean, that's the natural beginner thing to do
[03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:58.840]   is to feel the way the nervousness
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:01.120]   about competition expresses itself
[03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:04.920]   is through the desire to be as light as possible,
[03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:07.840]   which is the totally wrong desire to have.
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:11.600]   - Right, like when you look at me now,
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:15.400]   I'm probably like 230, right?
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:20.780]   But I probably have the strength of a 70 kilo Judo player.
[03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:24.420]   Right, the weight doesn't really do much.
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:27.200]   - I mean, you have the same thing with wrestling.
[03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:30.200]   The skinny guys, the skinny you
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:31.620]   that we're looking at there,
[03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:34.900]   just the amount of power in that person is fascinating.
[03:10:34.900 --> 03:10:36.920]   - It doesn't look like you have some muscle,
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:38.240]   but it doesn't look,
[03:10:38.240 --> 03:10:40.480]   but I've felt the power of some of those people.
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:41.500]   - Yeah.
[03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:42.340]   - It's scary.
[03:10:42.340 --> 03:10:43.160]   - Yeah.
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:44.000]   (laughing)
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:44.840]   It's different.
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:46.840]   - That's the best way I can describe it is like scary.
[03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:47.840]   It's like, oh shit.
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:49.640]   Again, it's the food chain.
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.240]   You're not at the top of the food chain.
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:52.080]   - Yeah.
[03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:54.040]   - Well, that's the natural feeling
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:10:56.480]   when you go with some Judo people.
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:58.900]   What's your sense about this recent Olympics?
[03:10:58.900 --> 03:11:02.000]   What stands out to you as,
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:03.460]   so like Teddy Renner,
[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:05.980]   who was on a big run for a long time,
[03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:08.260]   many consider him to be one of the greatest Judo players
[03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:09.060]   of all time,
[03:11:09.060 --> 03:11:12.900]   two-time Olympic gold medalist,
[03:11:12.900 --> 03:11:16.180]   and two-time Olympic bronze medalist,
[03:11:16.180 --> 03:11:17.020]   so four Olympics.
[03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:18.300]   - Two closed, yeah.
[03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:21.580]   - Not counting like team stuff, just doing individual.
[03:11:21.580 --> 03:11:24.620]   And then like 10 time world champ.
[03:11:24.620 --> 03:11:26.340]   - Yeah, I'm not sure how they're gonna catalog
[03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:27.860]   that team event.
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:29.860]   Like, are they all technically Olympic champions
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:32.040]   or is France an Olympic champion?
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:33.860]   - No, they're all technically Olympic champions,
[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:35.740]   but I'm gonna ignore that.
[03:11:35.740 --> 03:11:37.500]   - Is that how they're gonna classify it now?
[03:11:37.500 --> 03:11:38.980]   - According, oh, sorry.
[03:11:38.980 --> 03:11:40.140]   According to Wikipedia,
[03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:41.940]   like according to the internet.
[03:11:41.940 --> 03:11:43.980]   I don't know, according to IGF or whatever.
[03:11:43.980 --> 03:11:46.260]   - 'Cause you know, some of those players never,
[03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:47.640]   you know, won a match.
[03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:49.660]   They just filled a spot.
[03:11:49.660 --> 03:11:52.140]   - Oh, that's even a starker example.
[03:11:52.140 --> 03:11:53.900]   Oh, that's sad.
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:55.620]   - You know, they lost in the individual
[03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:57.900]   and then they also lost in the team.
[03:11:57.900 --> 03:11:59.740]   And so.
[03:11:59.740 --> 03:12:03.320]   - Well, it's interesting because in the case of Teddy,
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:08.700]   he was important to the win against Japan in this Olympic.
[03:12:08.700 --> 03:12:11.220]   So like in the team event.
[03:12:11.220 --> 03:12:14.980]   So like, I feel like you should put that in the equation
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:16.860]   and say who won gold, right?
[03:12:16.860 --> 03:12:20.300]   It does feel like he won gold in the team
[03:12:20.300 --> 03:12:21.860]   because he carried the team.
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:25.480]   - Well, you have like Nomura at 60 kilos from Japan,
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:28.200]   three time Olympic gold medalist, no team event.
[03:12:29.140 --> 03:12:29.980]   - Yeah.
[03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:33.780]   - Are you gonna weigh Teddy's team event?
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:35.820]   - No, no, we're not arguing this, of course not.
[03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:37.940]   - No, I'm just wondering how like the IJF,
[03:12:37.940 --> 03:12:40.340]   like when you look at a player's stat,
[03:12:40.340 --> 03:12:44.260]   is it gonna be like team gold medal for the Olympics
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:47.020]   versus like their own personal gold medal?
[03:12:47.020 --> 03:12:51.580]   - Yeah, I think in sports we have to be brutally honest.
[03:12:51.580 --> 03:12:55.420]   And I think, hopefully this doesn't piss off people.
[03:12:55.420 --> 03:12:56.260]   - I hope it does.
[03:12:56.260 --> 03:12:58.620]   - But judo is an individual sport.
[03:12:59.140 --> 03:13:01.600]   It's honestly just that one athlete,
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:04.160]   maybe the athlete and coach, right?
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:06.100]   If you look at the big, big picture,
[03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:08.940]   but there's no team in judo.
[03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:10.820]   That's the beauty of combat sports.
[03:13:10.820 --> 03:13:12.580]   That's the honesty of it.
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:16.160]   That's the brutality of losing to another human being
[03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:17.420]   in a combat sport.
[03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:20.500]   That's why it's so damn embarrassing when you get slammed
[03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:23.020]   is because it's like, there's no team
[03:13:23.020 --> 03:13:26.860]   to like carry some of that responsibility.
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:29.020]   It's all on you and you suck.
[03:13:29.020 --> 03:13:30.280]   That's what you lost.
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:31.420]   There's that weight.
[03:13:31.420 --> 03:13:32.980]   And that's why it's like magical.
[03:13:32.980 --> 03:13:34.820]   It's not like soccer.
[03:13:34.820 --> 03:13:37.500]   It's not like basketball.
[03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:38.820]   - Yeah, I couldn't play team sports
[03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:42.020]   'cause if one of my teammates wasn't doing their job
[03:13:42.020 --> 03:13:44.260]   correctly, I would go play their position.
[03:13:44.260 --> 03:13:45.640]   Like I'm gonna do it better than you.
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:48.440]   - Yeah, but that, some of the greatest leaders of teams
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:49.280]   also do that.
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:50.400]   Michael Jordan is like that, right?
[03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:54.360]   I mean, it's like with your actions,
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:57.880]   you raise the level for everybody.
[03:13:57.880 --> 03:13:59.400]   Like excellence is expected
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:01.000]   and therefore everybody needs to step up.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:04.940]   So some of the greatest, I would say team leaders
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:07.360]   are individualists at heart.
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:10.080]   But so, okay, so Teddy, I think 10 time world champion,
[03:14:10.080 --> 03:14:12.440]   non-team, regular.
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:15.320]   - It's a big number, but I think he has some like
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:16.640]   open weight categories in there.
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:17.800]   - Open weight, right, right.
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:19.600]   I mean, you can count those, right?
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:20.840]   I mean, that's interesting.
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:22.920]   - It's the same division twice.
[03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:24.000]   - It's the same division twice.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:24.840]   - That's right.
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:25.660]   - One day after another.
[03:14:25.660 --> 03:14:26.500]   - Yeah, that's right.
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:28.880]   - I don't know if I wanna count that, yeah.
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:30.880]   - Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons
[03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:35.200]   people don't usually put heavyweights in judo
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:37.860]   as like the greatest of all time,
[03:14:37.860 --> 03:14:40.120]   because the level of competition is lower.
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:40.960]   - Yes.
[03:14:40.960 --> 03:14:44.680]   - But anyway, he did lose in this match
[03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:49.680]   to a young Russian, Tamerlan Barsheev.
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:53.840]   Match also not on the internet.
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:55.200]   Thank you, Olympics.
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:58.200]   I am definitely going to go on some rants on the internet.
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:01.480]   Because as a fan of Olympics,
[03:15:01.480 --> 03:15:04.920]   I feel like this definitely needs to change moving forward.
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:07.440]   The like every single major Olympic event,
[03:15:07.440 --> 03:15:09.400]   I'm also like, I also like random sports,
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:10.240]   like weightlifting,
[03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:11.800]   even though I don't do Olympic weightlifting.
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:12.840]   - It's fun just to watch.
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:16.840]   - Fun to watch such high level of excellence.
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:20.620]   And the fact that we can't just fricking watch the full,
[03:15:20.620 --> 03:15:23.920]   like each nicely categorized event is really heartbreaking
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:26.280]   in judo, in Olympic weightlifting,
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.640]   in track and gymnastics, all of that.
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:32.360]   Anyway, so Teddy lost.
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:34.000]   I mean, does that stand out to you?
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:35.840]   If you were to like recap the things
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:37.560]   that you remember from this Olympics.
[03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:41.240]   - I picked him losing already, like in my predictions.
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:42.600]   - Lose which where?
[03:15:42.600 --> 03:15:44.780]   That match or just in general somewhere?
[03:15:44.780 --> 03:15:45.620]   - In the final.
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:46.640]   - In the final, you thought?
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:48.480]   - Yeah, final or was it semi?
[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:50.740]   When I looked at his draw because he decided
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:52.820]   not to compete throughout the quad
[03:15:52.820 --> 03:15:54.820]   and do like the bare minimum to go,
[03:15:54.820 --> 03:15:57.600]   because of his age,
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:01.400]   I didn't think he would have enough energy
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:04.860]   to battle his way through the draw that he had.
[03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:06.420]   And sure enough, he didn't.
[03:16:06.420 --> 03:16:07.860]   He fell earlier than I thought,
[03:16:07.860 --> 03:16:12.860]   but he's not the young athletic person he used to be.
[03:16:12.860 --> 03:16:16.460]   And when they changed the rules to judo,
[03:16:16.460 --> 03:16:19.200]   they allowed people to take people into really,
[03:16:19.200 --> 03:16:22.820]   really deep waters, which you saw at this Olympics,
[03:16:22.820 --> 03:16:27.820]   which, you know, did it ruin the sport or did it not?
[03:16:27.820 --> 03:16:30.220]   Like, I'm not sure,
[03:16:30.220 --> 03:16:32.300]   but it was definitely difficult to watch.
[03:16:32.300 --> 03:16:35.500]   - Would you put him at the greatest of all time
[03:16:35.500 --> 03:16:36.740]   or ask another way,
[03:16:36.740 --> 03:16:38.500]   like who do you think is the greatest judo player
[03:16:38.500 --> 03:16:39.860]   of all time?
[03:16:39.860 --> 03:16:42.900]   - He's definitely not the greatest judo player,
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:45.620]   but he's definitely the best competitor.
[03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:48.180]   - What's the difference in judo player and competitor?
[03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:49.680]   - There's an ability to like,
[03:16:49.680 --> 03:16:56.020]   do the act of judo of like throwing, pinning, arm locking
[03:16:56.020 --> 03:16:58.760]   versus can you win a judo match?
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:02.660]   Right, like when you look at somebody like Nomura,
[03:17:02.660 --> 03:17:05.500]   who like through everyone he fought,
[03:17:05.500 --> 03:17:09.060]   through three Olympics, multiple world championships,
[03:17:09.060 --> 03:17:12.980]   multiple things, like that's a pure judo player.
[03:17:12.980 --> 03:17:16.540]   In the essence of judo, he can throw, pin or arm lock
[03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:19.540]   just about anybody he steps on the mat with during his time.
[03:17:19.540 --> 03:17:25.460]   Teddy tended to, when you look at his judo,
[03:17:25.460 --> 03:17:27.380]   because of his size,
[03:17:27.380 --> 03:17:30.300]   again, it's just because he's in the heavyweight category,
[03:17:30.300 --> 03:17:33.320]   he was so much bigger, so much stronger,
[03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:35.960]   people just couldn't handle it.
[03:17:35.960 --> 03:17:39.180]   And you would see really good judo players just break.
[03:17:39.180 --> 03:17:40.020]   - Yeah.
[03:17:40.020 --> 03:17:41.980]   - Like they could hang in there for a little bit,
[03:17:41.980 --> 03:17:45.180]   but eventually his size, like you can't control that weight.
[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:46.140]   Weight moves weight.
[03:17:46.140 --> 03:17:48.060]   And when you have to use all your strength
[03:17:48.060 --> 03:17:51.620]   to keep him upright and off of you,
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:52.780]   your muscles just give out
[03:17:52.780 --> 03:17:55.820]   'cause you don't have somebody of that stature
[03:17:55.820 --> 03:17:59.060]   and that skill like to train with, to train those muscles.
[03:17:59.060 --> 03:18:04.060]   - So what you're thinking more like those 73, 81, 90 kg people
[03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:08.180]   that just stand in the pocket and just give everything.
[03:18:08.180 --> 03:18:11.140]   - Like what comes to my mind is like a Koga.
[03:18:11.140 --> 03:18:11.980]   - Koga.
[03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:14.220]   - You know, a Nomura who's a 60 kilo guy,
[03:18:14.220 --> 03:18:16.580]   but again, like his dynamics
[03:18:16.580 --> 03:18:20.640]   and how long he was dominant for, like it just.
[03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:24.860]   - Do you put value to like epic throws,
[03:18:24.860 --> 03:18:28.060]   like singular moments of greatness?
[03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:31.780]   - If it's against a noteworthy player
[03:18:31.780 --> 03:18:34.180]   in a noteworthy position.
[03:18:34.180 --> 03:18:36.900]   There are a lot of highlights of people
[03:18:36.900 --> 03:18:38.480]   that are good judo players,
[03:18:38.480 --> 03:18:43.480]   but their highlights are of scrubs on the IJF circuit.
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:47.260]   It's like, great, the Japanese guy threw the guy
[03:18:47.260 --> 03:18:51.740]   from Senegal free poem.
[03:18:51.740 --> 03:18:53.860]   Great, we kind of expected that.
[03:18:53.860 --> 03:18:54.940]   You took the world number one
[03:18:54.940 --> 03:18:57.900]   against the 330th person in the world.
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:18:59.420]   What'd you think was gonna happen?
[03:18:59.420 --> 03:19:01.020]   Like when I see those highlights
[03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:02.820]   like thrown around like social media,
[03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:05.840]   I'm like, that's not a highlight.
[03:19:05.840 --> 03:19:07.780]   They might as well have just been at the dojo
[03:19:07.780 --> 03:19:09.460]   like practice and throws.
[03:19:09.460 --> 03:19:12.540]   - If you look at the like top 10 list for judo,
[03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:15.600]   Kano always comes up, you know, as.
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:18.260]   - But he's not somebody that I don't think
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:19.880]   his results are there,
[03:19:19.880 --> 03:19:23.660]   but you don't really know how he got there.
[03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:27.380]   So it's hard for me to like, I can't see his judo.
[03:19:27.380 --> 03:19:28.380]   So I'm not sure.
[03:19:28.380 --> 03:19:29.940]   - Kano, by the way, is the founder of judo
[03:19:29.940 --> 03:19:30.780]   for people who don't,
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:32.520]   or considered to be the founder of judo.
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:35.140]   - Yeah, the sport evolves.
[03:19:35.140 --> 03:19:36.260]   The players that are like,
[03:19:36.260 --> 03:19:37.980]   if you took champions from the past
[03:19:37.980 --> 03:19:40.580]   and you fought them against the players of today,
[03:19:40.580 --> 03:19:43.020]   they're, it's not happening.
[03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:44.900]   And that goes with anything, right?
[03:19:44.900 --> 03:19:46.240]   So every time you think of like,
[03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:48.060]   who's the best of all time,
[03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:52.060]   it's probably somebody within a generation or two of today.
[03:19:52.060 --> 03:19:56.140]   If I'm gonna pick my top three, let's say top three,
[03:19:56.140 --> 03:19:59.580]   and I would go generationally speaking,
[03:19:59.580 --> 03:20:01.300]   I would pick Ono for today,
[03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:06.200]   probably Iliad is for like my timeframe,
[03:20:06.200 --> 03:20:09.840]   like the, from a developmental standpoint,
[03:20:09.840 --> 03:20:11.760]   and then I'd probably go Koga.
[03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:14.400]   And then before Koga, I'd probably go Nomura.
[03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:15.240]   - Nomura.
[03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:18.640]   - As like the person of that generation that people like,
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:23.240]   as a whole in judo respected.
[03:20:23.240 --> 03:20:25.200]   - Yeah, well, in the case of,
[03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:27.360]   I wonder if people feared Koga.
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:28.320]   - Yeah.
[03:20:28.320 --> 03:20:32.360]   - Yeah, I hear that little guy's gonna get under you.
[03:20:32.360 --> 03:20:33.800]   - And you're gonna go for a ride.
[03:20:33.800 --> 03:20:36.360]   - You know, he was 78 kilos when he took second
[03:20:36.360 --> 03:20:39.000]   at the All Japan's, which is an open weight class.
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:39.880]   - Yeah.
[03:20:39.880 --> 03:20:43.080]   - You know, like he could throw down with anybody,
[03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:45.320]   any weight class and still win.
[03:20:45.320 --> 03:20:48.800]   - He was one of the early people that planted the seed
[03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:50.480]   of judo, love of judo in you.
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:52.800]   - Yeah, and when I looked at him,
[03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:57.560]   like that was how like I wanted my judo to be portrayed,
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:20:59.000]   that style.
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:00.040]   - Yeah.
[03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:02.400]   And then Ilias Iliadis, you just like,
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:04.600]   I mean, you have a similar attitude as him.
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:05.440]   So you just like the way he carries himself.
[03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:06.800]   - That's why we get along.
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:12.200]   - You guys hang out, I'd love to see that conversation.
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:15.200]   - I remember when we were talking about like his coaching,
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:17.920]   I was like, why didn't you take this team?
[03:21:17.920 --> 03:21:19.320]   Or like, why'd you pick this team?
[03:21:19.320 --> 03:21:21.520]   And he's like, I can't work with those people.
[03:21:21.520 --> 03:21:23.960]   Like those people are weak, they're children.
[03:21:23.960 --> 03:21:25.720]   Like they don't know how to train hard.
[03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:27.720]   - I love that guy.
[03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:28.560]   What about Ono?
[03:21:28.560 --> 03:21:30.080]   I think he was competing in this Olympics.
[03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:32.000]   He got gold in this Olympics, right?
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.400]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:36.080]   - He lost in the team tournament though.
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:37.240]   I think he just didn't care.
[03:21:37.240 --> 03:21:38.080]   - Yeah.
[03:21:38.080 --> 03:21:39.240]   - He just really wanted to throw that guy.
[03:21:39.240 --> 03:21:41.000]   - He like throws everybody.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:41.840]   - Yeah.
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:44.960]   - So he represents the thing you're mentioning.
[03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:49.200]   I signed up to the judo fanatics, best of Ono.
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:51.480]   Is there something that stands out to you about him
[03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:53.720]   that's especially you find beautiful,
[03:21:53.720 --> 03:21:56.200]   like or powerful about his technique?
[03:21:57.880 --> 03:22:00.440]   - His adaptability to the situations
[03:22:00.440 --> 03:22:05.080]   and understanding of like what needs to happen
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:07.200]   in order to throw these people.
[03:22:07.200 --> 03:22:10.360]   I specifically watched a match with his
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:12.440]   and I was going to do a breakdown video on it
[03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:13.560]   because-
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:15.160]   - Is there a match, do you remember what it is?
[03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:20.160]   - It's him versus Garvey of Hungary.
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:21.880]   - Is he good at gripping?
[03:22:21.880 --> 03:22:24.080]   So we're watching the match against Hungary.
[03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:26.400]   So at the one minute,
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:28.240]   so right here coming up,
[03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:29.960]   I've heard he's freakishly strong.
[03:22:29.960 --> 03:22:32.640]   I've never had the ability to train with him.
[03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:33.800]   So I'm not-
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:35.480]   - Obviously he looks super skinny.
[03:22:35.480 --> 03:22:39.040]   - But when you see him without his gi jacket on,
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:40.880]   like he's a jack dude,
[03:22:40.880 --> 03:22:44.820]   which is uncharacteristic of a Japanese player
[03:22:44.820 --> 03:22:46.640]   from back in the day,
[03:22:46.640 --> 03:22:47.740]   in a way changed all that.
[03:22:47.740 --> 03:22:48.580]   He was like,
[03:22:48.580 --> 03:22:50.600]   we're going to get physical to compete with the Europeans.
[03:22:50.600 --> 03:22:52.080]   - That's another one of the greats, right?
[03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:52.920]   - Yeah.
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:54.560]   - He doesn't get mentioned enough.
[03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:56.720]   (silence)
[03:22:56.720 --> 03:23:03.440]   - And he's a righty here, yeah.
[03:23:03.440 --> 03:23:04.360]   Okay.
[03:23:04.360 --> 03:23:06.320]   - And this is where he started setting it up.
[03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:07.800]   It's like, you can see he was standing
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:09.920]   in like a left-handed stance and then he changes.
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:11.920]   (laughing)
[03:23:11.920 --> 03:23:14.680]   - So he grips almost like a double,
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:17.560]   double sleeve, not a double sleeve,
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:18.400]   but the tricep.
[03:23:18.400 --> 03:23:19.320]   - The tricep.
[03:23:19.320 --> 03:23:23.120]   - And the front sleeve standing like a lefty.
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:27.160]   - No body grip, just tricep and sleeve.
[03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:30.240]   And that was like the biggest whip
[03:23:30.240 --> 03:23:32.840]   and twist of a Nuchimada.
[03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:35.480]   - Yeah, he doesn't actually lift him off the floor.
[03:23:35.480 --> 03:23:39.500]   And if you look at it in like slow motion, almost,
[03:23:39.500 --> 03:23:44.040]   yeah, let's, yeah, there we go.
[03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:48.980]   The Hungarian player was like a hundred percent defense
[03:23:48.980 --> 03:23:50.160]   and he still did this.
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:55.040]   Right, so right here, like press pause.
[03:23:55.040 --> 03:24:00.040]   This is like an identifier if you're trying to like learn
[03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:02.360]   Judo and figure out how to set it up
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:05.080]   because knowing how to get to the point
[03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:06.400]   right before you pull the trigger
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.600]   is probably the most important.
[03:24:08.600 --> 03:24:10.800]   So when we watch this play out,
[03:24:10.800 --> 03:24:12.960]   what Ono's gonna do is he's gonna pivot off
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:14.600]   his right leg right here.
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:16.280]   He's gonna backstep with his left
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:19.120]   and it's gonna pull Ungarvy's front leg
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:20.840]   all the way forward into what we would call
[03:24:20.840 --> 03:24:23.160]   like a neutral square stance.
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:25.640]   So he plants hard and look at-
[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:27.240]   - Oh, there's an interesting pull with the tri,
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:28.320]   oh no, it's not tricep.
[03:24:28.320 --> 03:24:30.960]   He almost like, it starts with the tricep
[03:24:30.960 --> 03:24:32.680]   and he like collects the gear or something like that.
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:34.160]   - But it's still above the elbow
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:36.320]   'cause you can see the bend, right?
[03:24:36.320 --> 03:24:38.600]   And right here, see how he never put,
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:39.800]   back it up a little bit.
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:43.760]   This is kind of like one of those things,
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:45.440]   yeah, pause it right there.
[03:24:45.440 --> 03:24:47.440]   So when he puts his right foot down,
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:50.600]   he's pulling so hard with his back
[03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:53.080]   that when Ono goes to put his left foot down,
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:55.040]   it never touches the mat.
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:57.400]   But by putting his left foot back,
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:24:59.680]   it actually pulls Ungarvy's foot forward.
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:02.440]   And so he's able to speed up his throw
[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:04.880]   by just continuing that motion back,
[03:25:04.880 --> 03:25:07.920]   which what was supposed to have been a step
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:11.800]   turned out to just, in the middle of the action,
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:13.440]   he makes a split second decision
[03:25:13.440 --> 03:25:16.040]   before putting the foot down to just continue
[03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:18.240]   'cause he recognizes that feel in his hands.
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:20.960]   - Yeah, and so it's like, it never, it's a swing.
[03:25:20.960 --> 03:25:22.880]   Like he never touches the ground with his left foot.
[03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:26.080]   - It never started as like a big swing to a back step.
[03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:28.080]   He changed his mind partway through.
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:30.680]   So right there, he wants to take a step.
[03:25:30.680 --> 03:25:32.760]   And then he goes, nope, he's bringing that foot forward.
[03:25:32.760 --> 03:25:34.200]   I'm just gonna go for it.
[03:25:34.200 --> 03:25:36.280]   - Wait, is he full?
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:37.800]   - Full air.
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:39.600]   - Look at that, boom, boom.
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:42.400]   - And look at, if you go a few more steps forward,
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:45.800]   right there, his hip is the same height
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.000]   as Ungarvy's shoulder.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:48.240]   - Yeah, that's crazy.
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:51.280]   - Because he's leaning so far into the throw
[03:25:51.280 --> 03:25:53.040]   with his body weight.
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:56.280]   And he's allowing that tricep grip to rotate.
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:58.840]   That's gonna draw Ungarvy forward.
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:01.200]   And now when you pause it right here,
[03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:03.480]   you think about the sheer physics
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:07.080]   to like get your body into this position.
[03:26:07.080 --> 03:26:09.200]   Jimmy and I were so like,
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:10.840]   when we saw this for the first time,
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:13.680]   we tried to just stand like that and we couldn't do it.
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.200]   His left foot is pointing straight ahead.
[03:26:17.200 --> 03:26:19.800]   His chest is perpendicular to that foot
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:21.360]   or parallel with it, right?
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:22.800]   And his head is by his foot.
[03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:25.560]   - Yeah, is that only possible in the midst of a throw?
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:27.560]   Do you think he works on making like?
[03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:30.400]   - I think he's done this particular throw,
[03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:33.600]   not this style of it, but Uchimata so much
[03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:37.480]   that his body has adapted to be able to do this.
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:38.960]   So when people are trying to learn
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:41.040]   and like break down videos,
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:45.080]   they don't understand like the power he has
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:47.860]   and what we call end range motion.
[03:26:47.860 --> 03:26:52.400]   - So like, look at the full range of motion he takes, right?
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:53.240]   - Yeah.
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:56.440]   - That left foot swings all the way around
[03:26:56.440 --> 03:27:00.120]   and the torso starts like at three o'clock
[03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:02.640]   and it goes all the way around,
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:04.760]   like almost back to the three o'clock.
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:05.600]   - Yeah.
[03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:10.240]   - And he never lifts his leg above his hip.
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:16.440]   And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it.
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:17.600]   - Yeah, look at that.
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:19.160]   - Stayed on his feet.
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:20.080]   - What's he doing?
[03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:24.520]   Is that a matter of pride or just?
[03:27:24.520 --> 03:27:25.440]   - I think that's just--
[03:27:25.440 --> 03:27:26.560]   - Habit?
[03:27:26.560 --> 03:27:29.820]   - The way the forces work, like he can just stay up.
[03:27:29.820 --> 03:27:34.640]   - That's one of the most beautiful throws I've ever seen.
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:39.680]   There's so much wrong with it, but it worked.
[03:27:39.680 --> 03:27:40.520]   - It worked.
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:41.340]   - Because when you think about,
[03:27:41.340 --> 03:27:42.680]   remember what we talked about at the very beginning,
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:45.640]   like he's got to get his center of gravity under his.
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.240]   Well, here's one of the top players in the world
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:48.960]   throwing another top player in the world
[03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:51.280]   with his hip at that guy's shoulder height
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:52.540]   and it's still working.
[03:27:52.540 --> 03:27:54.520]   It's--
[03:27:54.520 --> 03:27:58.480]   - Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great.
[03:27:58.480 --> 03:27:59.320]   - Yeah.
[03:27:59.320 --> 03:28:02.480]   - And like he switched a lot of those details
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:03.960]   of the throw in the middle.
[03:28:03.960 --> 03:28:04.800]   - In the middle.
[03:28:04.800 --> 03:28:07.160]   - Yeah, that only is, that means he's probably what,
[03:28:07.160 --> 03:28:09.600]   like 100,000 times that throw has happened?
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:11.280]   - Yeah.
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:12.880]   - I saw you were into chess recently.
[03:28:12.880 --> 03:28:16.640]   So you're, like me, a bit of a beginner in chess.
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:20.440]   You're part of launching the website Effective Chess.
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:23.000]   So I got to ask, maybe it's a personal question,
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:26.400]   but do you have advice to yourself and to other beginners
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:29.600]   in exploring chess of how to one, have fun
[03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:31.660]   and two, to start getting good?
[03:28:31.660 --> 03:28:35.360]   It's nice to see like Olympic caliber athlete
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:40.360]   take on a difficult task with a beginner's mind.
[03:28:40.360 --> 03:28:42.760]   So like, what's that process like?
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:47.760]   - I'm a huge fan of just learning new things in general.
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:51.920]   Right, like when I left Judo, like I took a job as,
[03:28:51.920 --> 03:28:55.560]   you know, marketing for Fuji Sports
[03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:58.280]   and I was getting frustrated with designers.
[03:28:58.280 --> 03:29:00.760]   So I learned Photoshop.
[03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:02.680]   I also got angry with the photographers.
[03:29:02.680 --> 03:29:05.040]   So now I take all the photos too,
[03:29:05.040 --> 03:29:06.920]   just because I don't mind learning.
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:11.220]   You know, I've spent my entire Judo career learning
[03:29:11.220 --> 03:29:13.160]   all the time, like adding new techniques,
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:16.600]   finding new ways, practicing, developing.
[03:29:16.600 --> 03:29:18.600]   And so when it comes to chess,
[03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:20.880]   I treat it just like I do anything else.
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:25.060]   I just stick to one plan and I learn all the ins and outs
[03:29:25.060 --> 03:29:26.640]   of that one plan.
[03:29:26.640 --> 03:29:29.540]   And then I develop another plan, right?
[03:29:29.540 --> 03:29:33.260]   Like all my practice, like a London opening, for example,
[03:29:33.260 --> 03:29:35.840]   and just, I don't even care if I win or lose.
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:39.000]   I just wanna figure out how I'm gonna lose
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:40.560]   and then figure out how I'm gonna win.
[03:29:40.560 --> 03:29:43.820]   And once I know, that position is now done.
[03:29:43.820 --> 03:29:46.360]   Then I start with another position.
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:48.440]   And then once I figured out how I'm gonna lose
[03:29:48.440 --> 03:29:49.720]   and how I'm gonna win,
[03:29:49.720 --> 03:29:52.100]   the next thing I do is I don't go to a third.
[03:29:52.100 --> 03:29:54.340]   I figure out the bridge between the two.
[03:29:54.340 --> 03:29:57.080]   Like at what point during my openings
[03:29:57.080 --> 03:29:59.500]   can I transition back into this opening?
[03:29:59.500 --> 03:30:00.340]   - Right.
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:02.940]   So like you have like some basic openings
[03:30:02.940 --> 03:30:05.260]   and you wanna see how they go wrong, how they go right,
[03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:06.100]   all the different ways.
[03:30:06.100 --> 03:30:09.420]   And then that starts to solidify a higher level concept
[03:30:09.420 --> 03:30:10.460]   of that particular opening.
[03:30:10.460 --> 03:30:12.300]   And you start to stitch together the concepts.
[03:30:12.300 --> 03:30:13.420]   - The concepts together.
[03:30:13.420 --> 03:30:15.560]   'Cause being able to go from one to another
[03:30:15.560 --> 03:30:19.580]   and then back and forth is part of the reasons
[03:30:19.580 --> 03:30:21.380]   why like I was successful at Judo
[03:30:21.380 --> 03:30:25.220]   is just because everything I do,
[03:30:25.220 --> 03:30:27.640]   at some point it touches that spider web
[03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:30.700]   of like being able to get from one area to another.
[03:30:30.700 --> 03:30:32.460]   We refer to it as like a toolbox, right?
[03:30:32.460 --> 03:30:34.580]   You need more tools in your toolbox.
[03:30:34.580 --> 03:30:36.220]   But if you're always grabbing the wrong tool
[03:30:36.220 --> 03:30:39.460]   for that job, then you're just not gonna have success.
[03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:41.380]   - I actually forgot to ask you,
[03:30:41.380 --> 03:30:44.280]   you mentioned a few greatest chess players of all time.
[03:30:44.280 --> 03:30:46.980]   And I noticed you didn't mention Vladimir Putin.
[03:30:46.980 --> 03:30:50.800]   I gotta ask you about his Judo.
[03:30:50.800 --> 03:30:53.800]   Do you by chance know much about his Judo?
[03:30:53.800 --> 03:30:58.340]   What do you think about a president of a major nation
[03:30:58.340 --> 03:30:59.680]   being a Judo black belt?
[03:30:59.680 --> 03:31:03.080]   And I think from what I've seen, pretty good at it.
[03:31:03.080 --> 03:31:09.060]   - I think it shows if he actually got it,
[03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:12.040]   like let's go with that premise of like he earned it.
[03:31:12.040 --> 03:31:14.340]   Right?
[03:31:14.340 --> 03:31:19.260]   That just shows like a level of like physical persistence
[03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:22.780]   and mental fortitude to be able to like
[03:31:23.600 --> 03:31:27.280]   take those beatings and just keep showing up
[03:31:27.280 --> 03:31:31.280]   until you've overcome and can now give those beatings.
[03:31:31.280 --> 03:31:32.740]   - As you know, in Japan and Russia,
[03:31:32.740 --> 03:31:35.260]   you get it by just like when you're young,
[03:31:35.260 --> 03:31:37.200]   it's easier to get a black belt when you're like
[03:31:37.200 --> 03:31:39.520]   just go through a bunch of beatings
[03:31:39.520 --> 03:31:42.840]   for like 10 years in your teenage years.
[03:31:42.840 --> 03:31:47.840]   But there's also from it springs like a camaraderie.
[03:31:47.840 --> 03:31:50.200]   There's a definitely a brotherhood
[03:31:50.200 --> 03:31:53.180]   and sisterhood in terms of Judo
[03:31:53.180 --> 03:31:57.540]   to where you're connected forever because of that.
[03:31:57.540 --> 03:31:59.380]   For many people, it's their childhood connection.
[03:31:59.380 --> 03:32:03.300]   You sort of leave Judo in your twenties and your thirties,
[03:32:03.300 --> 03:32:04.260]   but that's always there.
[03:32:04.260 --> 03:32:05.480]   And the same is true with wrestling.
[03:32:05.480 --> 03:32:10.480]   So it's interesting to see him pay respect to that,
[03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:15.700]   like by going with the Russian national Judo team.
[03:32:15.700 --> 03:32:17.180]   And I think he did, obviously,
[03:32:17.180 --> 03:32:18.940]   they have to get thrown, right?
[03:32:18.940 --> 03:32:20.780]   But just, you can tell,
[03:32:20.780 --> 03:32:22.300]   and you probably could tell even better,
[03:32:22.300 --> 03:32:24.500]   but you can tell when a person moves
[03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:26.140]   in a way where you're like, okay,
[03:32:26.140 --> 03:32:30.780]   you've had like 10 years of beatings and you can tell
[03:32:30.780 --> 03:32:32.520]   the way they pull, the way they move.
[03:32:32.520 --> 03:32:36.700]   But I also like in contrast to the US national team,
[03:32:36.700 --> 03:32:40.860]   or I don't even think there's a national team for US, right?
[03:32:40.860 --> 03:32:42.660]   It's the Patriot Judo Center, right?
[03:32:42.660 --> 03:32:47.540]   That there is some, it's really cool
[03:32:47.540 --> 03:32:49.100]   when there's a camaraderie like that
[03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:52.600]   amongst the highest level Olympic caliber athletes in Russia.
[03:32:52.600 --> 03:32:54.820]   I suppose Japan might have similar kind of thing.
[03:32:54.820 --> 03:32:56.580]   And then you have,
[03:32:56.580 --> 03:33:00.660]   then you can have the system of people together
[03:33:00.660 --> 03:33:03.020]   and then you can have a strong coaching staff,
[03:33:03.020 --> 03:33:05.180]   not just like a coach, but a coaching staff.
[03:33:05.180 --> 03:33:07.180]   And then you can have the nation backing that staff.
[03:33:07.180 --> 03:33:09.060]   I mean, and then the result is like,
[03:33:09.060 --> 03:33:12.220]   you have some incredible level of Judo emerge.
[03:33:12.220 --> 03:33:15.380]   Is there something you could say,
[03:33:15.380 --> 03:33:17.540]   we didn't talk much about Jimmy.
[03:33:17.540 --> 03:33:20.480]   I mean, he was a critical part of your just,
[03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:25.420]   like of your perseverance through all the,
[03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:27.220]   all that you had to go through.
[03:33:27.220 --> 03:33:28.820]   What did you learn from Jimmy?
[03:33:28.820 --> 03:33:32.660]   What are some impacts that he had on your life,
[03:33:32.660 --> 03:33:34.260]   both on the mat and off the mat?
[03:33:34.260 --> 03:33:39.660]   - You know, if we had to like put it down
[03:33:39.660 --> 03:33:42.980]   to like a very simple thing, he taught me how to win.
[03:33:44.900 --> 03:33:47.420]   Right, it wasn't necessarily like
[03:33:47.420 --> 03:33:49.380]   the technical side of Judo.
[03:33:49.380 --> 03:33:51.820]   Like we went over gripping, we went over this,
[03:33:51.820 --> 03:33:53.700]   we adapted that.
[03:33:53.700 --> 03:33:56.420]   But the real strength to Jimmy was like,
[03:33:56.420 --> 03:33:58.420]   he knows how to win.
[03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:00.700]   And most people think,
[03:34:00.700 --> 03:34:03.060]   well, if I get really good at this technique,
[03:34:03.060 --> 03:34:05.700]   I'll be able to throw people with it and I'll win.
[03:34:05.700 --> 03:34:09.500]   That is not how the world of sports works, right?
[03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:13.300]   Like I remember in one of my YouTube videos,
[03:34:13.300 --> 03:34:17.540]   I was doing a breakdown of a match from the Cuba Grand Prix
[03:34:17.540 --> 03:34:19.820]   where I was fighting a Mongolian guy.
[03:34:19.820 --> 03:34:22.220]   He's kicking the shit out of me, not gonna lie.
[03:34:22.220 --> 03:34:26.900]   Four minutes in, like he just throwing me like left
[03:34:26.900 --> 03:34:28.780]   and right, he was so fast.
[03:34:28.780 --> 03:34:31.180]   I felt like I just couldn't get to him.
[03:34:31.180 --> 03:34:34.580]   In the last 30 seconds, he changed.
[03:34:34.580 --> 03:34:37.580]   He started protecting his lead
[03:34:37.580 --> 03:34:38.980]   instead of continuing the fight
[03:34:38.980 --> 03:34:41.900]   the way the entire match was going in his favor.
[03:34:41.900 --> 03:34:43.020]   He made a mental shift.
[03:34:43.020 --> 03:34:45.460]   And when he made that mental shift, I beat him.
[03:34:45.460 --> 03:34:46.300]   - Yeah.
[03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:49.280]   - 'Cause he didn't know how to win the fight.
[03:34:49.280 --> 03:34:54.260]   He can win exchanges, but he can't win the fight.
[03:34:54.260 --> 03:34:56.660]   So the last thing you wanna do is have to
[03:34:56.660 --> 03:34:59.900]   win every exchange in a match.
[03:34:59.900 --> 03:35:03.900]   You wanna know how to kick it into sixth gear.
[03:35:03.900 --> 03:35:06.140]   Like when to step off the gas,
[03:35:06.140 --> 03:35:08.020]   when to focus on gripping,
[03:35:08.020 --> 03:35:10.500]   when to attack, how often to attack,
[03:35:10.500 --> 03:35:12.700]   all those things like-
[03:35:12.700 --> 03:35:14.540]   - And you've had those conversations with Jimmy,
[03:35:14.540 --> 03:35:16.460]   like this is not like how to stop
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.460]   trying to win every exchange, that kind of thing.
[03:35:18.460 --> 03:35:19.300]   - Yeah.
[03:35:19.300 --> 03:35:20.120]   - And instead-
[03:35:20.120 --> 03:35:21.040]   - 'Cause I was a brawler before.
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:23.620]   I was like, if I threw you once, I'm throwing you again.
[03:35:23.620 --> 03:35:24.460]   - Yeah.
[03:35:24.460 --> 03:35:25.280]   - And sometimes you get caught.
[03:35:25.280 --> 03:35:26.120]   - Yeah.
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:27.120]   - Why would I do that?
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:28.900]   I'm already winning.
[03:35:28.900 --> 03:35:30.680]   - What about like the mental side of the game,
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:32.860]   the preparation, all those things?
[03:35:32.860 --> 03:35:35.900]   - One of the biggest things Jimmy brought to the forefront
[03:35:35.900 --> 03:35:37.640]   when it came to like the mental side
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:41.140]   was the visualization, right?
[03:35:41.140 --> 03:35:44.380]   And when I started visualizing myself winning,
[03:35:44.380 --> 03:35:46.700]   I started seeing more success.
[03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:49.380]   But once I started seeing more success
[03:35:49.380 --> 03:35:52.780]   with the visualization also came self-doubt.
[03:35:52.780 --> 03:35:57.780]   Because as I'm starting to picture myself like,
[03:35:57.780 --> 03:36:02.220]   I would picture myself before fighting Church's Villi,
[03:36:02.220 --> 03:36:05.260]   I'm gonna throw him with Koshi Guruma and I can see it.
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:08.280]   And if I stand in the chute for too long,
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:11.580]   you start to like, but what if he counters?
[03:36:11.580 --> 03:36:14.640]   Then you go, well, if he counters with this,
[03:36:14.640 --> 03:36:15.760]   I'm gonna counter with that.
[03:36:15.760 --> 03:36:18.040]   But you already let that doubt in.
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:20.620]   And then you start playing this like five-step scenario,
[03:36:20.620 --> 03:36:22.200]   but you still come out on top.
[03:36:22.200 --> 03:36:26.400]   But all that doubt has like seeped into your mind, right?
[03:36:26.400 --> 03:36:31.400]   And a lot of people don't understand that that's a bad thing.
[03:36:31.400 --> 03:36:33.720]   You're still winning in your mind,
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:35.840]   but you're also doubting yourself in your mind.
[03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:38.920]   - Yeah, once you let the, like that little slip in,
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:40.600]   it's destructive.
[03:36:40.600 --> 03:36:44.680]   - Yeah, and so I remember I was at the world championships.
[03:36:44.680 --> 03:36:47.500]   I can't remember what year it was, but I was ready.
[03:36:47.500 --> 03:36:50.440]   Like I was healthy, I was ready to go.
[03:36:50.440 --> 03:36:52.380]   And we all thought like,
[03:36:52.380 --> 03:36:55.360]   this is the year Travis wins the worlds.
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:36:57.900]   I go out there in the first round,
[03:36:57.900 --> 03:37:00.180]   I'm in the chute for like 45 minutes.
[03:37:00.180 --> 03:37:03.080]   Like the match went into golden score,
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:05.120]   then the next match went into golden score,
[03:37:05.120 --> 03:37:07.440]   and the fucking next match went into golden score.
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:09.040]   Then the referee came and told me,
[03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:10.620]   "You can't wear your gi."
[03:37:10.620 --> 03:37:12.800]   Then big Jim goes, "Why can't he wear his gi?"
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:14.380]   Any gi that has his name on it,
[03:37:14.380 --> 03:37:15.520]   we're not gonna let him wear.
[03:37:15.520 --> 03:37:17.280]   He has to wear a different gi.
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:18.800]   So then I go, "Fuck you, I'm leaving."
[03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:20.520]   And I walked out there and I fought.
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:22.480]   I lost in golden score 'cause I did a Kochi
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:23.880]   and they called it a false attack.
[03:37:23.880 --> 03:37:27.360]   And I went, "Great, I'm out of the fucking worlds."
[03:37:27.360 --> 03:37:29.240]   But when I was in the chute,
[03:37:29.240 --> 03:37:33.200]   I struggled because I started allowing the like,
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:37.480]   Hungarian guy that I was gonna face to do things to me
[03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:40.260]   that I would have to play defense to and then counter.
[03:37:40.260 --> 03:37:44.360]   It's like, great, but now I'm doubting my own ability.
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:46.680]   So I went to a sports psychologist
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:49.920]   and the big game changer for me was,
[03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:54.320]   I focused more on the emotional, physical response
[03:37:54.320 --> 03:37:56.160]   that happens in matches,
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:37:59.720]   rather than the actual quote unquote,
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:02.920]   like Instagram picture that would have happened.
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:05.480]   So when I was getting ready for 2016,
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:08.360]   you think about like,
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:10.420]   how do you feel like standing in the chute?
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:11.520]   Like, what does your body feel like?
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:12.560]   Is your heart racing?
[03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:13.400]   How's your breath?
[03:38:13.400 --> 03:38:15.160]   Is your mouth dry?
[03:38:15.160 --> 03:38:16.280]   And then you think about like,
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:18.280]   okay, the ref just started the match, what happens?
[03:38:18.280 --> 03:38:20.240]   Like, what's the atmosphere like?
[03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:23.120]   How do you emotionally respond to these things?
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:28.060]   More so than me trying to beat a specific judo player.
[03:38:28.060 --> 03:38:30.500]   Right, like, oh, the ref just gave you a penalty
[03:38:30.500 --> 03:38:32.440]   at a minute 30, like, how do you feel?
[03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:35.840]   And then you start thinking about the physical responses.
[03:38:35.840 --> 03:38:37.720]   And when you do that really well,
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:39.560]   you can actually get the pins and needles
[03:38:39.560 --> 03:38:41.000]   and your body will start to sweat
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:44.720]   and your heart will start to race as if you're in it.
[03:38:44.720 --> 03:38:47.340]   'Cause it's not about the technique,
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:49.120]   it's more about the physical,
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:50.520]   like, what does it feel like
[03:38:50.520 --> 03:38:52.520]   to have your fingers ripped out of a gi
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:54.200]   in the first exchange?
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:56.240]   Now my hands can feel that.
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:38:57.080]   - That's fascinating.
[03:38:57.080 --> 03:38:59.240]   - And then on a cellular level,
[03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:02.200]   like I fought the Olympic game so many times
[03:39:02.200 --> 03:39:05.160]   to the point where like, it is no longer a goal,
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:06.640]   it's an anticipation.
[03:39:06.640 --> 03:39:09.600]   - Right, so down to the experience of the grip break,
[03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:13.560]   the just the sweat, the heart beating, the yeah.
[03:39:13.560 --> 03:39:15.680]   - What does it feel to have your head smashed into a mat
[03:39:15.680 --> 03:39:17.680]   and driven across the mat with a mat burn?
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:19.640]   - Yeah, and then getting back up.
[03:39:19.640 --> 03:39:21.160]   - And getting back up.
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:24.000]   - Yeah, like with a bit of a burn, all that kind of stuff,
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:25.440]   the actual sensations on the skin.
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:27.880]   - The actual sensation of what it takes
[03:39:27.880 --> 03:39:28.720]   to fight a judo match.
[03:39:28.720 --> 03:39:30.200]   - It's not a strategy, like,
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:32.480]   but the actual sensations, the experience,
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:34.280]   that's fascinating.
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:36.520]   - 'Cause then your body's gonna fight hundreds of matches
[03:39:36.520 --> 03:39:38.520]   without the physical damage.
[03:39:38.520 --> 03:39:41.200]   - And you could probably get really far with that
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:44.320]   and not also in just judo, but basically anything.
[03:39:44.320 --> 03:39:49.380]   You can simulate if you learn how to simulate well.
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:55.680]   - You've lived a very, a hell of a life.
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:39:58.840]   Is there advice you can give to young people?
[03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:01.540]   Sort of a high school, college,
[03:40:01.540 --> 03:40:05.280]   thinking about their career, thinking about life,
[03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:06.940]   how to live one they're proud of?
[03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:15.760]   - I think the number one thing I can tell people is,
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:18.560]   and how I've lived my life is,
[03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:21.920]   you've really gotta forget everybody in your life right now,
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:24.040]   your mother, your father, your grandparents,
[03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:26.520]   your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whoever it is,
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:30.800]   and really decide what is gonna make you happy.
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:34.020]   At some point in my career,
[03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:38.280]   the act of pushing my body to the limit
[03:40:38.280 --> 03:40:42.180]   made me happier than winning a Grand Slam medal.
[03:40:42.180 --> 03:40:47.120]   Pushing my body to the limit didn't make me happier
[03:40:47.120 --> 03:40:48.720]   than winning an Olympic medal.
[03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:52.920]   There's a balance there.
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:56.400]   And I think a lot of people struggle with living their life
[03:40:56.400 --> 03:41:00.480]   where they're happy and they make other people happy
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:04.680]   or take in their feelings into the considerations
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:06.560]   of what they need to do in their life.
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.760]   And I think if they can cut those strings sooner,
[03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:13.880]   it'll allow you to get over it quicker
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:16.200]   and get to a happier place sooner.
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:17.640]   And then as long as you're focusing
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:19.120]   on what's making you happy,
[03:41:19.120 --> 03:41:22.120]   the things you do that make you happy
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:25.040]   will attract other people who do those things
[03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:29.400]   that will in turn build stronger, better relationships.
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:34.400]   - And then you will also realize the best form of yourself
[03:41:34.400 --> 03:41:35.960]   and inspire many others.
[03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:40.960]   Like you've inspired me to, for whatever the hell I've done,
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:44.800]   at least to do a slightly better job
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:47.440]   than I otherwise would have by doing martial arts,
[03:41:47.440 --> 03:41:49.280]   by taking that journey.
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:51.280]   And I think becoming a better person because of it.
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:53.640]   So Travis, I have been,
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:56.880]   I continue to be one of your biggest fans.
[03:41:56.880 --> 03:42:01.240]   I love your whole career in the way you pursued happiness.
[03:42:01.240 --> 03:42:03.120]   I love what you and Jimmy have done.
[03:42:03.120 --> 03:42:06.240]   I love the sport of judo as represented by you.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:08.920]   So I deeply appreciate what you've done, man.
[03:42:08.920 --> 03:42:09.760]   - Thank you.
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:11.200]   - And I'm honored that you would spend your time
[03:42:11.200 --> 03:42:12.040]   with me today.
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:13.040]   Thanks for talking, man.
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:13.880]   - Thank you.
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:17.000]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:18.440]   with Travis Stevens.
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:19.760]   To support this podcast,

[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:24.800]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:27.080]   from Napoleon Bonaparte.
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:30.360]   Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake.
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:34.240]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:36.840]   (upbeat music)
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:39.440]   (upbeat music)
