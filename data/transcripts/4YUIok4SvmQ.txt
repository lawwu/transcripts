[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   I should like to call your attention this morning to this great prayer offered by the
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.240]   Apostle Paul for the Church at Ephesus, which is recorded in the third chapter of the Epistle
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.560]   to the Ephesians, and I shall read from verse 14 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.100]   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.040]   family in heaven and earth is named; that he would grant you, according to the riches
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.880]   of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner men; that Christ
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.240]   may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.240]   able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and depth and height,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.920]   and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge; that ye might be filled with all
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.440]   the fullness of God.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.000]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.640]   according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church, in Christ
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.000]   Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Amen.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.220]   Now I want this morning to call your attention particularly to the last two verses, verses
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.840]   20 and 21, the great doxology.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:39.400]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.580]   according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church, in Christ
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.320]   Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.760]   Amen.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.120]   Thus the Apostle, you see, ends this amazing prayer that he has been offering for these
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.760]   Ephesians with this great and grand doxology.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.000]   Nothing could be more fitting after the prayer than this; indeed, nothing else would be fitting
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.960]   at all apart from this.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   We have seen how the Apostle has risen from petition to petition and from height to height,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.680]   and at last he has reached the climax, the acme, beyond which nothing is possible.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.600]   Nothing can ever happen to us greater than the answer to and the satisfaction of that
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   petition that we may be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.200]   Having asked for that, having prayed for that, there is nothing more that one can do.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.600]   There is no further prayer.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.500]   There is nothing, I say, but to praise God.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:10.120]   And so the Apostle ends with this doxology.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:21.460]   The Apostle, I say, was anxious, having thus produced his petitions, to praise God.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.560]   And it is not surprising that he should have felt this desire to praise God.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.960]   Undoubtedly, it worked in his mind like this.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.240]   Here he is, he has been praying that these Ephesians may be strengthened with all might
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.400]   according to his glorious power by the Spirit in the inner man.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   That is a tremendous thing in and of itself.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.320]   He has gone on to pray that they might have Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.560]   And then this prayer that they might know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   and indeed be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.760]   And then, as it were, he stops and asks himself, "What is it that makes all this possible?"
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.800]   And there is only one answer.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.560]   It is the grace of God.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.600]   He has already been celebrating it in the second chapter.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.320]   He has been reminding these Ephesians that it is God who in his great love, wherewith
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.160]   he loved us, who has done all this.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   It is because of the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us in Christ
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.320]   Jesus.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   And here, having offered the petitions, he realizes that this staggering thing which
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.160]   he has just been expressing in his prayer has been made possible only in that way because
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.440]   of the grace of God.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.640]   It is all of grace.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.920]   It is entirely given.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.500]   There is nothing in man to deserve it, nothing in man to recommend himself.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.480]   He finds himself asking for these immensities.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   And he realizes that it is a practical possibility because of this way of salvation that God
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:21.240]   himself has provided in and through his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.920]   He has prayed that they might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.280]   And because that is something that can happen and can become true, his soul and heart are
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.920]   bursting with a desire to praise and to thank and to glorify the God who has made such things
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.000]   possible for men.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.640]   I am arguing, in other words, that the apostle ended with this doxology because he could
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   not do anything else.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.760]   He could not help himself.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.120]   The thing had so gripped him and moved him, the thing was so staggering to him that he
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.280]   just involuntarily almost bursts forth into this great hymn of praise and of worship and
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   of adoration.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.680]   He wants all the glory to be ascribed unto him who is the giver and the author of the
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.280]   salvation and who alone deserves the glory and the honor and the praise.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   Very well, that is why the apostle, I say, uttered this doxology.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   But now the question arises, do we feel impelled to join him?
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.200]   Are we animated by the same feelings and the same thoughts?
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.760]   Having read these various petitions in the prayer and having gone on to the climax, do
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.560]   we feel the inevitability of the doxology?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.320]   Are we conscious, as the apostle was, of this almost unrestrainable desire to praise God
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.080]   and to magnify his grace?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.600]   Have we, as the apostle was, been moved and thrilled as we have realized these tremendous
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   possibilities for us in this present life, the things we have been going through and
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.040]   considering in detail?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.360]   We cannot read this doxology without facing that question.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.400]   Have we got the inevitability of it?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.080]   Are we in it with the apostle?
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   Do we feel there is nothing else to do and nothing else to say?
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.960]   Or are we perhaps rather feeling that the apostle has said too much?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:45.080]   That after all we believe the gospel and we are Christians and we believe that all this
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:53.680]   is by faith, but that when he begins to talk about Christ dwelling in our hearts and our
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.500]   knowing this love of Christ and of being filled with all the fullness of God, that surely
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.200]   he has just gone a little beyond himself, that he is beside himself, he is the victim
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.560]   of his own eloquence, he has been carried on by the rhythm of his own language.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.600]   I wonder whether we are feeling that, and feeling that perhaps the things that the apostle
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.560]   has been praying for here are not really possible for us in this life and in this world, or
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.320]   perhaps possible only to some very exceptional people like the apostle Paul, or those who
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.960]   are called saints who have segregated themselves from the world and have gone off into monasteries
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   and/or have become hermits and have just lived for the Christian life and have taken it up
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.400]   as their one vocation.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.120]   Do we feel that this is beyond the reach of the ordinary Christian so-called, and that
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.240]   this kind of thing is certainly not possible for us?
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   Now, which is it?
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.840]   It's one or the other.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.180]   We have either, I say, caught the glimpse of these things and seen their possibility,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.600]   and if we have, well then, we must offer the doxology and join the apostle in it.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.320]   But of course, if we are doubtful and hesitant, well, we will be just debating and arguing
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.520]   with ourselves and saying, "Isn't this some strange sort of mysticism, or as I say,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.440]   hasn't the apostle rather been carried away by his own eloquence?"
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.240]   Which is it, my friends?
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   This doxology tests us this morning.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.320]   It isn't something we are going to look at objectively.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.640]   The question is, are we in it?
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.320]   Do we join the apostle?
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.840]   Do we feel it welling up within us as something inevitable?
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:50.200]   Oh, I have a fear within me that far too many of us merit the rebuke that God administered
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:57.720]   to the children of old in that 81st psalm which we read together just now.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:04.840]   Where is God looking at these people for whom he would have done so much?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.000]   But they didn't believe, they staggered in unbelief, and he says, "O Israel, if thou
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.080]   wilt hearken unto me, there is no end to what he'll do for them.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.880]   Open thy mouth wide," he says, "and I will fill it."
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.800]   "Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways."
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.400]   But they hadn't.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.720]   They were frightened of the enemy.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.960]   They couldn't receive these promises.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.400]   They felt they were too great.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.000]   They staggered in unbelief.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.360]   They felt these things were not really possible.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.040]   They argued, "Look at the enemy," they said, "Look at their power.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.480]   Look at our weakness."
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.560]   They didn't believe the word of God.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.360]   They didn't believe the promises.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:01.200]   And they wandered and meandered, as the record tells us, doubtful and hesitant and fearful,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.080]   and sitting in their tents so often and commiserating with themselves.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.760]   What a sorry figure they cut.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.120]   And it was all due to the fact that they couldn't believe the promises.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.260]   They felt they were too great, too good to be true.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.040]   I ask, what is the position with respect to us?
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.960]   What is our reaction to the petitions that the apostle has been offering, one after another,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.120]   leading to the great and the glorious climax about our being filled with all the fullness
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.440]   of God?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:44.200]   Now, I wonder whether the apostle had some feeling within him that some of these Ephesians
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.420]   might very well be like that.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.300]   I raise that possibility for this reason.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:59.380]   You notice that he couches his expression in this doxology in such a way as to answer
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.580]   such a possible difficulty.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.820]   He can't forget that he is still the teacher.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.260]   Even in the doxology and in ascribing praise and glory to God, there is an exhortation.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.220]   He is meeting this possible lack of faith, this possible staggering in unbelief.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:26.380]   So he puts it like this, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:32.220]   that we ask or think according to the power that is in us, unto him be glory."
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.940]   He might have said, you see, "Now unto him, the God who promises so much beyond glory
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:45.220]   in the church by Christ Jesus," but he deliberately adds that other portion.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:54.580]   And I am suggesting to you that he does that because he had this feeling within him, that
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:01.300]   perhaps some of these Ephesians were feeling as I have been suggesting.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:10.740]   So you see, as the apostle praises God, he at the same time encourages us to pray, and
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.540]   in a sense teaches us to pray.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:19.900]   Very well, let me put it as a deliberate and a blunt question.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.940]   Are you doubtful about these things?
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.320]   Do you really believe that Christ can dwell in your heart by faith?
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.540]   Is he dwelling in your heart by faith?
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.900]   Have you been able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.340]   and the depth and the height?
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.740]   And have you known the love of Christ which passeth knowledge?
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:52.460]   I mean by that, have you felt it, have you experienced it, have you known it in an experimental
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   manner?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.980]   I know you believe it, you have accepted it by faith, you say, "Yes, it is, I see it,
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.980]   I believe it."
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.980]   That's not what I'm asking.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.660]   We've seen that this word "know" carries the experimental emphasis.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.420]   It is a knowledge of experience.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:15.100]   The love of Jesus, what it is, none but his loved ones know.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.420]   Do we know it in that sense?
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.220]   And do we know something about being filled with all the fullness of God, the satisfaction
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:31.060]   of which we were considering together last Sunday morning?
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:39.780]   Now I am suggesting that if we do not know these things, it is because finally we are
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   ignorant of God, and ignorant of the glory of God.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:53.700]   We are ignorant of what he has really purposed for us in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.260]   We are ignorant of what he really has treasured and stored up for us in the person of his
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.220]   only begotten Son.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.020]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.100]   In him God has treasured up all his stores of grace and of wisdom and of knowledge, and
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.900]   we are complete in him.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.780]   It's all there.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.160]   Now I say if we don't know these things, if we haven't experienced them and felt their
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.120]   power, it is because we are lacking in that knowledge.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.920]   We haven't really grasped it.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.040]   We haven't taken it in.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.980]   We are fundamentally ignorant of the power and the glory of God.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:39.620]   Very well then, let us hearken unto the exhortation that is contained in the doxology.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.180]   The apostle here, I say, comes and helps us.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.180]   He stoops to our weakness.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.300]   He meets us in the place of our ignorance and unbelief.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.060]   And so he seems to me to put it to us like this.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:01.500]   The thing you need, he says, above everything is to know the greatness of God's power.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.100]   Well how can we know that power?
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:11.780]   Well he says, first of all, look at this great power of God objectively.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.980]   Look at it as it were in and of itself.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.720]   Then he will ask us to look at it subjectively.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.540]   And then he'll ask us to look at it in terms of the church.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:29.780]   But now start first of all with this idea, the greatness of God's power as seen objectively.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.980]   Now I need scarcely to remind those who attend here regularly that this in a sense has been
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:41.420]   the greater theme of the apostle from the end of the first chapter right until this
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.380]   point at which we have arrived.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.300]   You remember that a way back in the first chapter the apostle writes to these Ephesians
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300]   and he says that he's praying for them.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.660]   He's praying without ceasing for them.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.100]   And he's praying that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.400]   These people have already believed the gospel, they're already saved, they've already been
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.660]   sealed by the Spirit.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.420]   Oh yes, they're quite all right, they're perfectly orthodox, and they're truly Christian,
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.980]   and they know that their sins are forgiven, yes, but says Paul, I am praying for you that
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.620]   the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.620]   Why?
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:26.900]   Well, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.780]   of his inheritance in the saints.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:40.500]   And thirdly, what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe?
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.900]   That's the thing he wants them to know.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.880]   And he at once begins to describe it in terms of the power that was exerted by God when
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.420]   he brought his own son from the grave back again into the world in life, the resurrection
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   power.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   That's it.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.420]   He wants them to know that.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.580]   He says that's the power that's working in you.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.700]   And then in the second chapter he's worked it all out experimentally and in detail.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.740]   And here he comes back to it again.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.900]   He wants them to know this.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:18.880]   The exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.880]   If only we knew that, we'd never stagger in unbelief at anything.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.180]   So the apostle wants them again to look at this power.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.520]   He's already, I say, defined it and described it and illustrated it in the power of the
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.860]   resurrection.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.420]   But now he comes and puts it in a different form here.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.060]   And he puts it in most extraordinary language.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.100]   If ever language was strained, it's strained in this doxology.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.580]   And of course he strains language because language is inadequate.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.380]   He is now trying to define the indefinable.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.520]   He's trying to measure the immeasurable.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.540]   He is trying to put in terms that we can grasp the illimitable and the absolute.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.140]   And this is, you see, how he puts it.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.940]   Watch him as he piles his words one on top of another, unless the authorized version
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.660]   here is really inadequate, it doesn't bring it out.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:17.060]   It reads, "Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think."
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.380]   But you know what the apostle really wrote was this.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.840]   Listen to him.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.420]   He takes a superlative, then he adds a superlative to it.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:30.340]   He first of all says, "Unto him that is able above or beyond all things."
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.940]   Well, you would have thought that that was enough.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.940]   What is God able to do?
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:41.740]   Well, he's able to do above or beyond everything, all things.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.220]   But he wasn't satisfied.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.180]   He added even to that.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:54.420]   He adds to that, "exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think."
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.700]   So let me read the entire sentence to you, "Now unto him who is able above all things
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:07.140]   to do exceeding abundantly beyond."
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.340]   I say that's straining language.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.500]   Even that is inadequate.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.020]   It shows the total inadequacy of language.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.460]   And of course, the apostle is absolutely right.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.780]   You use your greatest superlative.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.540]   It doesn't describe the power of God.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.620]   Add another to it, and multiply them, and add them together, and multiply again, and
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.580]   go on and on and on, beyond all things, exceeding abundantly beyond.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:43.500]   Well, it's nonsense in a sense, and yet, of course, it's absolute truth.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.300]   Is there anything beyond all things?
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   Yes, the power of God is.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.260]   It's exceeding abundantly beyond all things.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.900]   That's precisely what he wrote.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:01.980]   And he does it, I say, in order that they might have some conception of this power.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.220]   Are you doubting my prayer, says Paul?
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.900]   Do you think I've gone too far?
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.300]   Do you think I've just been carried away by my own rhetoric or eloquence?
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.140]   Do you think I'm just lost, as it were, in some mystical state where logic and reason
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.700]   have been left behind?
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.700]   Listen to me, he says.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.180]   I've been praying to a God whose power is eternal and absolute, beyond all things, exceeding
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.060]   abundantly beyond.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.340]   That's the power about which I'm thinking, and it's in terms of that power that I've
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.860]   been praying.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.140]   And then, of course, he comes down to our level and helps us a bit.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.940]   This power of God, he says, is beyond all things and exceeding abundantly beyond in
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:52.260]   its ability to do above and beyond what we ask or even think.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:22:02.060]   Now, sometimes in our prayers, we may think that we've been a little bit daring.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:08.040]   We've asked for something that seems quite impossible.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:15.260]   But moved by the spirit in our prayer, we've asked for something that seemed to us to be
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.260]   quite impossible.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.940]   It's all right, says Paul.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:29.920]   He's able to do beyond all things, exceeding abundantly beyond all that you can ask.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.700]   John Newton understood it, and that is why he said in the second verse of that hymn that
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.340]   we've just been singing, "Look here," he says, "are you going to pray?
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.460]   Well, before you utter a sound, stop, think.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.660]   Ask yourself what you're doing.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.660]   Don't rush with your petitions to God.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.300]   Wait for a moment and ask yourself, to whom am I praying?
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.320]   Who is the being and what is the being that I'm about to address?"
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:05.020]   And he answers his own question by saying, "Thou art coming to a king.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:13.140]   Large petitions with thee bring, for his grace and power are such.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.120]   You can never ask too much, never.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.460]   Bring your most daring petitions, bring your most impossible requests, add others to them.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.380]   Let the whole church join together in their wildest desires and demands.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:37.560]   Go on, it's all right, for his grace and power are such.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.100]   You can never ask too much."
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:48.340]   It's beyond all that we can ever ask, but not only that, it is beyond even that which
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.960]   we can think of.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:58.220]   And this is not a division without a distinction.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.240]   There is this difference, isn't there, between what we ask and what we think?
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:10.120]   We are constantly drawing this distinction in daily life.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.640]   We talk about the realm of the possible.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.120]   Politics we are told is the art of the possible, concentration upon the possible.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.160]   Ah, men may say, "Yes, it would be very wonderful if we could."
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.880]   Ah, but it isn't possible.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.120]   He can think of something very wonderful, and men can think of an ideal and a perfect
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.400]   state, but he says, "In a world like this you can't, so you don't ask for that.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.920]   You ask for that which is possible."
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.120]   There is this distinction between what we ask and what we think.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:49.680]   There is this limit which we tend to put upon our requests and upon our actual petitions,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   because we are always hemmed in and bound, as it were, by this idea of the possible.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.440]   But then we like to soar in the mind and in the imagination, and to think of possibilities,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.360]   and we say, "Oh, how wonderful it would be if only that were possible."
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.200]   We've risen to a higher level altogether.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.080]   It can't happen in this world, but we can conceive of it, we can think of it.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.600]   Ah, the apostle covers that also.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:27.460]   He is not only able to do exceedingly beyond, exceeding abundantly beyond, all things and
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:33.880]   all that we can ask, but also all that we can conceive of, all that we can think of,
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.360]   all that we can imagine, all that we can spend with the highest flights of an inspired thought
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:48.800]   and imagination, he's altogether beyond it.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.000]   Isn't this our trouble, my friends?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.920]   God is not man, and the greatest sin of every Christian and of the Christian church is to
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:09.440]   limit the eternal, absolute God according to the measures of our own minds, and our
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.840]   concepts and understandings.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.920]   Oh, the Bible is full of it.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.440]   God's people have always been guilty of this.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.760]   They have limited the Holy One of Israel.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:28.000]   "If only," says God to them.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.600]   And it was the same, you remember, when our Lord was here in the days of the flesh.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.760]   He said the same thing to the people of Jerusalem, "If only."
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.600]   But I say it is, alas, the record of God's people.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.320]   They've all tended to stagger, Sarah did.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.520]   They've gone on doing it through the Old Testament.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:56.200]   It happens in the New, when the angel went to announce to Mary that she was to give birth
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.280]   to the Son of God.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.400]   Mary staggered in her unbelief, and the angel had to reprimand her, saying, "With God, nothing
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.800]   shall be impossible."
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.680]   Why do you say, "How shall these things be?
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.760]   How can these things be?"
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.880]   You're staggering because you're thinking as a human being, you're limiting God.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.520]   I'm talking about what God's going to do, and with God, nothing shall be impossible.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:34.000]   Do you remember how one afternoon the disciples, having watched our Lord dealing with a so-called
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.440]   rich young ruler, and having heard what he said to him, this good young man who'd kept
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:50.800]   the law in his sense of keeping the law, handsome probably to look upon, a man well known for
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.120]   his benefactions, and for all his goodness, he goes away sorrowful.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.160]   And these apostles come to our Lord and they say, "Who then can be saved?"
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:09.360]   And our Lord looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.240]   with God all things are possible."
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.560]   Oh, how constantly we are guilty of this.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:24.040]   We are guilty of limiting God in our petitions and requests for ourselves.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.120]   We say, "I'm a busy man of affairs.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.120]   I haven't got the time.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.480]   How can I be filled with the fullness of God?
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.960]   These things are not possible."
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.700]   So we limit his power.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.400]   We limit our petitions with respect to others.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.680]   We say, "The man is so steeped in sin, nothing can save him."
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   You're concerned about some loved one and dear one who's antagonistic to Christ and
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.160]   blaspheming his name.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.800]   You've prayed for years, you say, "There's no point in it.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.200]   I believe psychology is right after all.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.400]   It's a matter of temperament."
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.760]   And you give up praying, "It's impossible," you say.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.880]   And the answer is, "With God nothing shall be impossible."
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:07.640]   He is able to do beyond all things, exceeding abundantly above and beyond all that we can
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   ask or think, "Israel, open thy mouth wide, and he will fill it."
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:29.680]   We are praying to God the Omnipotent, the Everlasting and the Eternal.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:38.480]   There the Apostle has invited us to look at the greatness of God's power objectively.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.120]   But come, let's come to the second way in which he asks us to consider it.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.560]   He asks us to look also at the greatness of God's power considered subjectively and in
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.800]   the realm of experience.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.080]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:07.760]   come, according to the power that worketh in us, come unto him, be glory in the church.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.800]   According to the power that worketh in us.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.280]   Ah, he's come down to the subjective.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.160]   He is now meeting us on our own ground.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.600]   You say, "Ah, yes, I've listened to your description of the power of God.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.960]   I've read it in the Bible before myself.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.240]   I see it there away in the distance somewhere, but there's all the difference between believing
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.840]   that and my life and my experience.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.560]   Can that come into this?"
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.560]   That's the question.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.040]   "Well," says Paul, "it not only can, but it has, according to the power that worketh
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   in us."
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.720]   "I'm not speaking in a purely academic and theoretical manner," says the Apostle.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.440]   "I'm appealing to your own experience.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.140]   The power that I'm talking about is the power that is already working in us."
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.920]   He brings it right down to that.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   And therefore this is, in a sense, a still greater proof because it answers all our objections
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.200]   that may arise from our subjective feelings.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.800]   Now the Apostle here is, in a sense, summing up most of what he's been saying in this
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.720]   great epistle in these first three chapters.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.840]   Is there anybody in Ephesus, he seems to ask, who is doubting the power of God?
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.200]   Is there anybody still tempted to say that I've gone too far and that I'm asking for
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   the impossible?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.680]   "Very well," he says, "I've already described the power of God to you.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.440]   But look here, you've got a proof, a better proof.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.440]   Listen to this.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.600]   What about this power that is working in us?"
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.060]   And first of all, he thinks of himself, "I have no doubt at all."
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.680]   You remember how we saw him referring to this at the beginning of this third chapter.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.080]   He says, "If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.680]   you, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery."
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:01.240]   There, he's taken them back to his own experience.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.600]   Does anybody doubt the power of God?
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.080]   Well, if so, says the Apostle, "Look at me.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:17.400]   I was before a blasphemer, a hateful and an injurious person.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:22.880]   I hated Christ with all the intensity of my being.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.960]   I did my best to massacre the Church and to destroy it out of sight.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.800]   There I was, and I was going down to Damascus, breathing out threatenings and slaughter.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.720]   Never was a man so opposed to Christianity.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:44.280]   Never was a man so held by prejudices, national prejudices, prejudice of training, prejudice
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.760]   of religion and of learning, prejudice of self-conceit and of self-righteousness.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:56.200]   Oh, the impossibility of a man such as Saul of Tarsus ever becoming a Christian.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.880]   But I am a Christian.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.740]   I am the man who preached the gospel to you.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   And how has it come about?
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.060]   There's only one explanation.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.800]   It's the power of God.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:16.040]   Nothing but this eternal power of God could have turned the blaspheming, persecuting Pharisee
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:23.060]   into the Apostle of Christ, yea, the Apostle of the Gentiles.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.160]   But this is a power that has not only been working in Paul, it is a power that has been
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.440]   working also in these Ephesians.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   Listen to it.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   Here it is.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.640]   "Ye were he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins."
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.400]   There's nothing more impossible than death.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's the end of all things.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.100]   "Wherein in time past ye walked according to the cause of this world, according to the
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.520]   prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.000]   among whom we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.560]   the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath even
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560]   as others."
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:12.580]   And there they were, absolutely hopeless.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:21.200]   But he adds to the description, "Wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:27.160]   in the flesh, that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:32.080]   of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.680]   in the world, barred out of the temple by the middle wall of partition, utterly hopeless,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.820]   lost, horned pagans."
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.920]   How can such people ever be Christians?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.800]   How can such people ever become inheritors of God?
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.640]   How can such people ever be joint heirs with the Jews?
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:03.360]   Oh, the thing is a sheer impossibility, and yet, says the apostle, you know it has happened.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.640]   You are in the church, and it has all happened because of this self-same power.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.320]   I want you to know that it is that power that alone has enabled you to believe the gospel.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.400]   You could not believe without it.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   You were dead.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.200]   A man cannot believe the gospel in and of himself.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.580]   He needs the power of the spirit.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.240]   It leads to belief.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.040]   Without it, a man is dead and lost and hopeless and damned and ruined and under the wrath
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.560]   of God.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.720]   But God can quicken the very dead, and he had quickened these Ephesians.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.760]   He had put life into them.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.440]   He had raised them together with Christ.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   He had caused them to be seated, even in the heavenly places, with Christ.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:56.280]   These, I say, who were so far off and so utterly and absolutely hopeless, the power of God
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:02.040]   had entered into them and had dealt with them and had delivered them, and they were there
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.000]   with Christ, seated in the heavenly places.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.280]   The logic, you see, is this.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:16.320]   The God who can do that can do anything, can do everything.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.400]   There is no limit to such power.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:24.560]   But very well, my friends, let us ask ourselves the questions.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.520]   Have you known this power?
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.720]   Does this particular argument here, between the commas, help you?
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:39.760]   According to the power that worketh in us, have you felt it?
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.960]   Do you know it?
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.540]   Do you know the change?
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.320]   Do you know the imparting of life?
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.520]   Are you aware of a new life thrilling in your being at this very moment as I am speaking
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.760]   to you?
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:57.080]   Do you know the power of the Spirit sanctifying you, revealing sin to you, bringing to light
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.820]   the hidden things of darkness, explaining the Word to you, creating desires after holiness
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.600]   and righteousness within you?
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.520]   Are you aware of being dealt with by God?
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.200]   Is He moving in you?
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:16.920]   Do you feel and know that He can keep you from falling?
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:23.080]   This argument is valueless to all who have never known the power.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:29.000]   But if you know this power of God working in you, well then, I say, you must go on,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.640]   you must be logical and say, "The God who has done this for me is a God who will do
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.200]   all the rest, and there is no end and no limit to it.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:43.280]   It is God's power and it is endless and eternal."
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.920]   I therefore argue with the Apostle, "If you know the power, well then, you can't
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.620]   stagger at what He has been offering.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.000]   If you have already felt this power, well then, it isn't too much to pray that you
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.540]   may be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.920]   And you must, you must go on, follow your own logic.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:06.000]   The power that has brought you hitherto will bring you to that.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.280]   And you can know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge."
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.360]   So he makes them look at the power objectively and then makes them look at it subjectively
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.480]   and thirdly and lastly, he asks them to look at the greatness of this power as it is seen
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.680]   and manifested in the church.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.840]   And to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:37.400]   the power that worketh in us, and to him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   all ages, world without end.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   Amen.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.160]   Again, you see, the Apostle is summarizing what he's already been saying.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.600]   There is the description of the power.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.940]   We know something about it experimentally.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.040]   We have felt the power.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.400]   We know the power.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.040]   It is still working in us.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:03.640]   Yes, but I suppose that another powerful argument and one of the most powerful arguments of
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:14.400]   all to bring us to a realization of this power of God is just to look at the Christian church.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   What a miracle.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:21.240]   There it is, the Apostle, as I've told you, has just been telling them about it.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.000]   They were Gentiles, aliens outside the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.280]   of promise.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.240]   There they were, and here were the Jews, self-righteous, proud, nationalistic, and the middle wall
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:40.200]   of partition between them, reconciliation between Jew and Gentile, madness, not within
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.080]   the realm of practical politics, the sort of thing that can't happen, nonsense, this
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:56.920]   wild imagination, this fevered imagination of this man, this epileptic, impossible.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   But it had happened.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:08.460]   You that sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.720]   He has made of both one.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.440]   He has broken down the middle wall of partition between them.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.960]   For here no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.640]   the household of God, and are being built up together on the foundation of the Apostles
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.000]   and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.740]   It had happened.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:35.520]   Nothing but the power of God could ever have brought about this reconciliation, could have
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.800]   produced the church, the one body by whom we both have access, by one body and by one
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.160]   spirit unto the Father.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.200]   Oh, you see the argument.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.600]   There is nothing in a sense that so shows the power and the glory of God as the Christian
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   church.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.840]   The Apostle has been reminding them of that in the 10th verse of this third chapter.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.340]   This, he says, is the intent, to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:12.120]   in the heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, and not
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.800]   only the wisdom but the power by the church.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.080]   You see it works like this.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.520]   He had already mentioned it all at the beginning of that first chapter when he asks them, when
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.800]   he prays that they might know the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.900]   He says it is the power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.640]   set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:41.480]   Far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named,
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.760]   not only in this world but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:53.200]   his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.640]   the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   There it is, you see.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.760]   That is what he is saying here again.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:11.740]   The church is the body of Christ and he is the head, and there is nothing that gives
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:19.400]   such glory to God as the Christian church.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.720]   God manifested his power when he created the world out of nothing.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.360]   He said let there be light and there was light.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.480]   The mountains and the rivers and the raging sea, the lightning and the thunder, they all
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:38.000]   proclaim, the heavens proclaim the glory of God.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.200]   But there is nothing that so proclaims the glory of God as the Christian church, the
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:53.920]   body of Christ, and Christ himself the head, and men and women such as you and I are, men
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:43:01.160]   and women that were steeped and lost and dead in sin, members of the body, the body of Christ
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.220]   here is the glory of God.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:08.920]   So it is not surprising that he says unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.680]   It is all in Christ and all through Christ.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   We are in him.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.440]   We are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones, as he is going on to say in
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.960]   chapter 5.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.600]   You see it works like this.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.080]   The Son glorifies the Father and the Son is glorified in us.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   He says so.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:32.880]   If you read the 17th chapter of John's Gospel, he says, I am glorified in them and he has
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.680]   glorified the Father and thus we minister to the glory of the Father in the church by
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.720]   Christ Jesus.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.800]   What a wonderful picture.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   There is the measure and the manifestation of this great power but I must introduce you
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:59.240]   again to this last phrase of his, another one again where he seems to be beside himself
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.800]   and piles on his adjectives upon his adjectives and his superlatives upon his superlatives.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.840]   Again our authorised is inadequate.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:12.320]   Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, it says, throughout all ages, world
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.520]   without end.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:26.280]   But this is what the apostle wrote, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, to
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:40.560]   all the generations of the age of the ages, you can't add to that, all the generations
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   of what?
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.500]   Well, of the age of the ages.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.840]   What is the age of the ages?
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:50.920]   There is no age to the ages, it is the age of the ages, age upon age upon age, forever
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:56.360]   and forever, infinite number of ages, everlasting eternity.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.720]   And do you notice what he says?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.440]   The church is going to be there.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:12.920]   Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all the generations of the
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:20.320]   age of the ages, you and I are going to be there.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:27.160]   Unto all the generations of the age of the ages, the principalities and powers in the
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:33.680]   heavenly places will look at us in astonishment and amazement and they will ascribe unto God
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:39.600]   all the honour and the glory and the majesty and the might and the dominion and the power.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.720]   It is here they see the glory and the wisdom of God as they see it nowhere else and you
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:51.800]   and I will thus be manifesting this glory forever and forever and to all the generations
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:58.160]   of the age of the ages.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.120]   That is the power of God.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:13.380]   While we are still in this world it is a power that is great enough to keep us from falling.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.860]   You remember Jude's doxology in benediction.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:26.720]   Now unto him that he is able to keep us from falling, oh, but he is not only able to do
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:38.560]   that, he is also able to present us faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.960]   joy.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   Unto him be glory and power and unto him alone the only wise God, our Saviour, beloved people.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.520]   Are you in this?
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.000]   Are you thrilling with the doxology?
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.240]   Having looked at the possibilities that are here open for you even now in Christ Jesus,
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.520]   having offered the petitions for yourself, have you said, "Oh, let all the glory on earth
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:25.120]   and heaven and sea and wherever citizens and beings are, let it all be ascribed unto the
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:37.080]   blessed God, the Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, our God, the God of salvation."
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:45.520]   Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus and to all the generations of the age
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   of the ages.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.680]   Are you in it?
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.120]   Amen.
