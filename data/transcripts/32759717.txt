[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.140]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.920]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.880]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.560]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.280]   But don't forget,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.780]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.780]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.480]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.860]   Well, listeners, I'm excited today to tell you
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.860]   that I have somebody who can answer all your questions
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.000]   about how to get started with foundations.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.320]   And so, okay, automatic disclaimer,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320]   nobody can answer all of your questions probably,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.560]   but I do have with me Courtney Bradshaw
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920]   who serves as an academic advisor
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.960]   with Classical Conversations,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.680]   and she helps foundations and essentials
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.600]   and even scribblers parents all the time
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.900]   figure out which end is up and how to walk forward.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.120]   She is a great encourager,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.640]   a homeschooling mama with lots of experience.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.140]   And so we are gonna talk today about,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.880]   oh my gosh, I've registered for this program,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920]   now what do I do?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.980]   What does it look like at home?
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.800]   How am I certain that I've got everything I need
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.420]   and that I'm doing it right?
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.580]   And I want everybody listening right now
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.240]   to take a deep cleansing breath
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   and realize that if God has called you to do this,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.240]   you are enough, you will find your people
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.840]   and there are resources to help you.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.960]   It is going to be, like I said in the intro blurb,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.540]   And I'll be perfectly honest,
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.540]   the homeschooling journey for me and my husband
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.960]   was one of the hardest jobs we've ever loved.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.900]   It has been a blessing beyond all measure to our family,
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.180]   but it hasn't always been easy.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.280]   But then again, nothing worth pursuing is easy.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.840]   So all that aside, Courtney,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.760]   - Thank you for having me, Lisa.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.240]   - I am really excited.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.440]   Now I've told everybody that you have all the answers
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.840]   and I gave the disclaimer,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080]   but that's probably not exactly true,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.460]   but you do have lots of years of experience.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.960]   How many years of experience does your family
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.240]   have with foundations
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.580]   and how old were your children when you started?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   - Well, we are beginning our 11th year in foundations.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.840]   - That is great.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.480]   - Yes, my oldest daughter was seven years old
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   and she just began challenge four.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   - Wow, oh my gosh, you are going to have,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   you are going to have a child that has the whole program.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.560]   That is super exciting, Courtney.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   - It is exciting.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.480]   So I will have a child where she's already began
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.200]   the program that she is in challenge for,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.440]   and then I have an infant.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   So we still plan all of the ages.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   - Oh wow, that's awesome.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.240]   That is so cool.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   So your oldest was seven when y'all started.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   So do you still have foundation students?
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280]   - I do, I still have four foundation students
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.120]   and then one who's not yet old enough.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.680]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.200]   - We're starting our 11th year
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.000]   and we still have about 10 more years to go in foundations.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.720]   - Girlfriend, you are going to be so good at memory work
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.920]   by the time your children graduate.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.960]   - I should be.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.640]   - You need to sign up for Jeopardy now.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.200]   You're going to know all the things, that is so cool.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.040]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   How much did you know about CC
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   or about classical education
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   or even about the foundations program when you started?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.960]   - Basically nothing.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.840]   - Oh my goodness, this is going to be a good story.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   - We had moved to a new town.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.720]   It was a really small town with very few homeschoolers.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.560]   And I was looking for community
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   and we did a co-op for one year
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.160]   and it was not really what we were looking for
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   because they were all older than my kids age at the time.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   And so I found, or the director in the next town over
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.720]   found me, I guess we found each other
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.320]   and she told me about CC.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.120]   And so we just jumped in
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.920]   with no knowledge of the classical model
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.680]   of classical conversations,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   just community is what I understood and was looking for.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.520]   - That is so cool.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.120]   Now, did you go and visit a foundations class
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.800]   before you jumped in as the director of a new community?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.960]   - I did not.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.920]   I tutored the first year.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   I found CC about a month before
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.760]   community began, it was during the summer.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   Practicum had already happened.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.120]   So I had not seen it at all.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.800]   And my very first experience
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.920]   outside of the really wonderful
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.680]   online academic orientation that we had 11 years ago.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.480]   - Yes, yes, very brief at that point.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.560]   - Yes, it was wonderful to have it.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.960]   But it has definitely come a long way.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   But outside of that, I had no experience
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.560]   and my director led my community day
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.200]   for my foundations group on our first day
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   so that I could see what it looked like that week.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.640]   And so we just, we went on from there.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.240]   - That is so inspiring, okay.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.840]   I know, I look back and think the things that I did
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.360]   in the early days of being involved with CC and the fact,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.240]   okay, here's a story too.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   I jumped in in 2004 at the Challenge B tutor level.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.760]   And I did not realize that I was accepted as a director
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.320]   because nobody else wanted to do that at the time.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.800]   We taught Greek and physical science
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   and mock trial and formal logic to eighth graders.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   And my tutor training in 2004 was one half day.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.680]   - Wow.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.880]   - And so I look back and think,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.520]   well, that was some kind of crazy,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.320]   but you know what it was?
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.200]   It was some kind of belief
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.960]   that the Lord had led me to this, just like you,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.560]   that the Lord had led me to a community
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.800]   and that He was gonna show me what to do
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.760]   and that there were other families
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.400]   that were willing to practice on our kids along with me.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.480]   And I look back and I think, wow,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.720]   I guess that took either a lot of trust
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.240]   or a lot of faith or a lot of stupidity.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.560]   And I'm not, some days I'm not sure which it was,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.400]   but I think that's really cool.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.480]   And that's really inspiring, Courtney,
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.360]   to people who are thinking,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.040]   I am tutoring for the first year
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   and I don't know what in the world I'm doing.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   Surely I'm not good at this yet.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   And here's the truth, y'all,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.520]   probably none of us are really good at it the first year.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.000]   We are learning alongside our children,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.840]   but God is good and God is gracious.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   And there's always a mentor out there who we can follow
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.520]   and who will answer our questions.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.320]   And so I think that's cool.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.240]   Your director is to be congratulated
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   and at bringing you along like that.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.120]   So was it community?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.760]   'Cause you said you didn't know a lot
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.920]   about classical education.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.040]   You didn't really know a lot about what CC
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.720]   was gonna give your kids beyond community.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.000]   So was that what drew you in?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.240]   - It is, community and accountability
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.360]   was what drew me in to CC.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.320]   What kept me there was that
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   and wanting and hoping that my children
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.720]   would receive an education that did not need to be redeemed.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.320]   I know at the time I heard a lot
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.720]   about I'm redeeming my own education through CC.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.000]   And I did, but I was hoping maybe to give them
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.040]   a better start than what I had experienced.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   And I'm so grateful.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   I remember on the way to community in our first year
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.000]   and just being overwhelmed emotionally,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.680]   listening to the timeline song
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.600]   and thinking just like what you said, Lisa,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.160]   that this was it.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.120]   I had found what we needed
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.520]   and I didn't even know I was looking for it.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.720]   I didn't know, I wouldn't have known how to look for it,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.800]   but I was so grateful that we found it.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.720]   - That is really, I think that is probably the testimony
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.480]   of a lot of us that whole,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.400]   and I'll be perfectly honest, Courtney,
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.280]   I didn't really think that when we started,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.880]   I didn't really think my education
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.400]   needed a lot of redeeming.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.320]   I mean, I had a public school education,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   but I love to read and I love to learn.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.120]   And I went to a very well-respected liberal arts college.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.080]   So I knew a lot.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.360]   I felt like I knew a lot about a lot of stuff,
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.680]   but man, were my eyes opened
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.160]   to all the connections I had missed
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   as my children began to gather pegs of information
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.760]   and then connect them as they matured.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.160]   I realized how badly my own education
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.200]   did need to be redeemed.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.760]   And I will tell you,
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.800]   one of the most exciting things to me
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   about raising children
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.400]   whose educations do not need to be redeemed
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.800]   is the realization that I came to,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   y'all have all probably experienced this,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.040]   when things get really hard
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.320]   or when you are really anxious or fearful,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.280]   you come upon a subject or an assignment even
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.400]   that you don't feel equal to.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.440]   What most people do when they get scared
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.760]   is revert back to what they know.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.560]   And so I reverted back
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.640]   to my public school education practices.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.080]   It was the teacher's fault
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.160]   or somehow the book had misled me
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.720]   or I didn't have what I needed.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.360]   Somebody should have helped me know how to do this.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   And I realized that what my children were learning
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.440]   was I'm responsible for my education
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.960]   and I have the tools
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.000]   to learn anything I want to know in the world.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And if there's something I don't know now,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.560]   I know how to find out what's missing
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.400]   and then know how to replace that piece of information
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.440]   so that I can move ahead.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.400]   That's what my girls got.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.800]   That's the classical model.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.200]   And so when they get scared
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.680]   or they come up on an assignment
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   or a class in college
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.080]   that they don't know what to do with,
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   they do have the skills.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.960]   So when they revert back to what they know,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.160]   it's classical.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.720]   - And it is so beautiful.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.840]   And so I agree with you.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.560]   That's what our hope for our kids
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.720]   is to receive the education
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.840]   that doesn't need to be redeemed.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.800]   All right.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.000]   So when you were getting ready for foundations,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.840]   getting ready to tutor foundations
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.160]   and getting ready to do it at home
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.280]   with your seven-year-old,
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.080]   what did you do to get ready?
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   - Well, I trusted my director when she said,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.120]   "All I needed was the foundations curriculum
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.680]   and a tin whistle."
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.840]   - All right, right.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.960]   - So I got that.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:56.000]   And we really have not changed very much
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.520]   in the past 11 years
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.240]   as to what I needed.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.960]   So for foundations specifically,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.880]   I got the curriculum
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.760]   and I prepared weekly.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.480]   I just, I looked at it.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.280]   As a tutor, I looked ahead,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.160]   but as a parent,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.200]   I probably would have just waited
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.240]   and let the tutor introduce it to me.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.360]   But we really did the very basics
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.760]   that we needed to do in that first year
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.200]   and did not add very much for foundations.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.040]   - Yeah.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.400]   So I guess you were doing
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.880]   what everybody does.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.440]   You had a teach them to read
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.400]   or a reading program
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.080]   and some kind of math computation program.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.440]   But as far as everything else went,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.000]   did you mostly just work on memory work?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.840]   - I did.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.200]   We worked on memory work.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.560]   We would go to the library
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.440]   and find some books about some of the things
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.480]   that went along with memory work.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.800]   And there were times
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.560]   that I would try to add in something different,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.880]   another history or a science curriculum.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.120]   And I never finished any of those
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.280]   because I didn't,
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.040]   I would just, we wouldn't need it.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.320]   We would take the memory work
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.480]   and we would go,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.080]   we would learn about what we wanted to.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.400]   We would take from it
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.960]   what we would wanted to learn more about.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.400]   And on this side of it
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.680]   with the Challenge 4 student,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.720]   I'm so glad that we gave up anything extra
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.680]   along the way,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.920]   because everything we did in foundations,
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.240]   we've repeated in challenge
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.600]   and they were ready for it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.640]   They were ready to take it further
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.880]   once they moved on to the challenge level.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.560]   And so we still in my home,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.960]   I have set aside any extra curriculum
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.440]   outside of a language arts and a math.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.640]   We just use what we have from the library.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.320]   I do have the Scribblers at Home curriculum
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.480]   and I love that so that I can open it up
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.000]   and say, hey, we're gonna,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.720]   we're talking about this today.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.120]   Maybe I can find something that's open and go
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.240]   from the Scribblers at Home,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.520]   or I've learned how to use those recipes,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.920]   make it my own and that helps as well.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.680]   But I have, I think the longer we've been in CC,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.840]   the less I try to do
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.480]   outside of the grammar of foundations.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.400]   - Wow, that is so encouraging.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.800]   Okay, all you moms and dads out there
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.520]   who are listening here thinking,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   oh, I've got to get a unit study on this
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   and we've got to have a field trip for that.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.400]   And I've got to find another curriculum
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   to teach this little niche.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.200]   Take a deep breath and listen to what Courtney said.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.160]   The memory work is a spine.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.640]   It is a skeleton,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.400]   but it is a complete spine and skeleton.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   And if you stay right there connected to that memory work
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.280]   in all of those areas,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.480]   your child is gonna be well-prepared
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.120]   when they hit the challenge years
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.200]   and start fleshing out all of the memory pegs
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.000]   that they have hammered in over the years.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.240]   It is beautiful to see.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.760]   And I think it's really freeing
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.680]   and energizing, Courtney, to parents
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.280]   for us to be able to say, yeah,
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.080]   chase your child's interest,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.760]   especially within that memory work.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.240]   If they are really into knights and castles,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.120]   read more of that stuff.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.960]   If they like to build forts in the backyard
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.360]   or out in the woods, do that.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   You know, if dinosaurs and fossils are their thing,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.200]   then go to the library or go find a history museum.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.800]   I love that, I love that.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   So you didn't worry about buying a lot of extra supplies
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.200]   or stocking up on extra curriculum,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.600]   at least after you realized you didn't need it.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.320]   No, I didn't.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.520]   I don't now.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.760]   Anyway, I've learned to set it aside.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   I tried it.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   I tried several things a few different times,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.120]   but we never finished.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   We never, it was a waste of,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.640]   it was a waste of my resources, honestly.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.600]   For me, it may not be for others, but for me,
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.480]   it was not something that I utilized often.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   Yeah, everything looks like a good idea,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.440]   and I have a lot of stuff on my shelf
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.040]   that looks like a good idea.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.840]   That, like you said, it wasn't necessary.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.000]   There was enough for us to chew on,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and we learned enough with what we had, with the basics.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.360]   Okay, so you jumped in to foundations,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.720]   'cause I suspect we have a lot of families
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.200]   who maybe are joining a foundations community
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.680]   for the very first time this year.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.760]   So how did you learn what to expect
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.200]   from the foundations day?
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   Were you surprised by anything?
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:44.080]   I was surprised that in the beginning
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.360]   that we just did memory work for the new,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   we just learned and memorized from those strands
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.560]   for the new grammar section.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.800]   I thought maybe we would talk a little bit about it
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.000]   during the community day,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.560]   but then after that first day
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.920]   where my director modeled it for me,
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.680]   I realized we really are chanting and singing,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   and I was also surprised at how fun it was,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.440]   how fun it could be to do that in a day,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   and really surprised at how much my children retained.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   Yes, yes.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.480]   That's really true.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.600]   There are lots of people that I've talked to at practicums,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.680]   and they come up and they say,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.480]   "Well, I know that on the foundations day,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.400]   "it's just about these crisp components,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.560]   "and we're just going to go through the memory work,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.120]   "but tell me the truth,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.680]   "that's not really all we're gonna do, is it?"
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.520]   And you have to say,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.400]   well, I mean, it's not that long of a time.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.560]   It really, you won't have time to do a lot
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.600]   because you will do hands-on arts,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   and you will do hands-on science,
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.360]   but yeah, pretty much what you're gonna be doing
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.200]   is memory work.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.440]   And people think, like you said,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.400]   that that's gonna be boring,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.200]   but your kids don't find it.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.000]   Why is it not boring?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.440]   Well, children love repetition.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.680]   They thrive on it, especially when they're young.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.280]   And so that's really,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.240]   I think that it's not boring for them,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.000]   but we're doing hand motions,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.920]   and we're moving our bodies,
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.880]   and doing exercises,
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.720]   or the hands-on science and the hands-on art
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.200]   are very much fun for my children
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.640]   because I'm not the most fun parent at home
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.360]   with things like that.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.480]   There's a lot of them,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.440]   and so it gets very messy in my house.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.320]   - Yes, oh my word.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.440]   - I love being able to leave that for community days.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.200]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   - And blow up somebody else's kitchen or do that.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.400]   I mean, can you imagine wanting to like finger paint
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.440]   or clay or use lots of glue
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.480]   with six or eight little children at home?
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.640]   - Well, I have seven.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.320]   - Foundations, it's fun.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.000]   That's right, Courtney, oh my word.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.600]   I can't even.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.720]   - So I can imagine, Lisa, I can imagine.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.640]   - Oh, and that's why you love foundations,
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.720]   and that we do art and science in class.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.840]   - That is so great.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.680]   That is so great.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   Now, listen, the moms and dads come to foundations,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.640]   mom and/or dad or grandma,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.560]   somebody comes with the foundation student into class.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.280]   Are the parents not bored?
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.600]   What are they supposed to be doing?
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.640]   Are we supposed to be chanting and finger playing
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.120]   along with our kids?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.400]   - Oh, cool.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.600]   - We are, we are to help,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.360]   and really the foundations day
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.200]   is a time for the tutor to model what we can do at home.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.400]   And so as a parent,
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.640]   we come and we learn new ways to introduce the concepts,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.640]   to introduce the memory work.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.920]   I take notes, I write it down
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.280]   right into my foundation curriculum,
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.600]   and I say, "Oh, she did this, I really enjoyed that,"
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.400]   or I have notes, I'm tutoring again.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.800]   I have not tutored in a few years,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   and I'm tutoring foundations again this year,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.840]   and I have all of my notes from the last time
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.440]   we went through cycle one, which is wonderful.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.280]   Very helpful this year as we're going back,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.960]   but parents are very involved on community day.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.160]   We are chanting and singing right along.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.960]   We're also just being helpful.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.000]   Someone needs to help little ones to erase maps,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.160]   or sometimes they help them open their snacks
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.720]   if they're really little.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.160]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.640]   - They're there to support the tutor.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.400]   So the day flies by for parents
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.480]   just like it does for the children.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.520]   - That's so cool.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   I know the first weeks in foundations,
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.200]   a lot of times are very eye-opening for parents
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.880]   who were not educated classically,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.200]   and that's most of us, still, that's most of us.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:32.120]   And just that whole idea that drilling memory work,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.680]   I mean, nothing sounds more horrific to say,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.880]   you're gonna spend hours drilling memory work
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.440]   with five and six and eight-year-olds,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.720]   but the practice of it is delightful.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.120]   The doing of it is actually delightful
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.920]   because tutors have learned from each other.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.320]   They've shared ideas about finger plays and body motions
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.880]   and changing your voice and different ways
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.720]   to get that memory work into these little minds.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.840]   And I can remember, I still remember way back
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.920]   when my girls were in foundations,
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.600]   I was determined that I was gonna learn
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.440]   all the things that they learned.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.720]   And so I was pretty good at keeping up
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   with all the timeline stuff for about the first six weeks.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.360]   And then, man, they outstripped me.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   Their little minds memorized so easily.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.000]   I mean, it sounds like when people outside say,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.080]   you just memorize like hundreds of pieces of information
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.640]   with little children, don't they hate it?
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.920]   No, they love it.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.360]   And they're so stinking good at it.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.560]   And they are so much faster to retain information
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.600]   than we are that it's amazing.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.400]   And so I think I'm glad that you brought that out,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   that parents, listen, parents, you need to sing those songs.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.320]   Let them become an earworm for your soul
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   because that way you can redeem your own education as well.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.720]   All right, I wanna ask you this, Courtney.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.360]   I think we've convinced everybody
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.040]   that the Foundations Day is super fun
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.240]   and super profitable, both for kids and parents.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.160]   But how can families incorporate Foundation's memory work
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.680]   into their at-home days or into their weeks at home?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.560]   How do most families use the memory work?
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.440]   I think the quick answer is that most families
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:48.440]   practice the memory work together at some point each day.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   So the great thing about it is for,
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.400]   I have a six-year-old and I have an 11-year-old
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.880]   and I have a couple in between,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.040]   but we can all do this at the same time.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.080]   'Cause all the classes, no matter how old the children are,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   all the classes are learning the same things every week,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   even if their tutor might use a different song
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.960]   or chant or finger play, right?
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.840]   Right, yes, it's all the same information
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.960]   no matter their age.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.840]   And so most families will get together at some point
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.640]   and practice that together.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.120]   We, in my home, do a morning time.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.320]   I love that from where we get together,
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.400]   we do a morning meeting.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.840]   Even my challenge age children join us for that,
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.240]   as we get together and spend some time praying
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.760]   and doing devotion together.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   But then my challenge girls go off about their business
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.400]   and then we practice memory work at the table together.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.880]   It takes about 30 minutes or less a day.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.480]   And if we do that every day,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.480]   we're pretty well equipped for at CC the next week.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.200]   Many families will take the memory work with them
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.840]   in the car, as they go to appointments,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.560]   that's something we do in the waiting room.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.200]   Right, right, right.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.040]   We take our memory work with us because it's easy.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.760]   It's just one book.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.240]   It's just one week and we practice.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.280]   And it really does not take long.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.800]   There's different ways to take it with you.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.880]   There's the CDs you can take and have memory work.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   And there's also a brand new CC Connected Lite app
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.640]   that has all of the audio files from CC Connected
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.040]   that you can download into the app
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.440]   and just take it with you in your phone, which is helpful.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.640]   And so most families, that's how they incorporate
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.720]   specifically the memory work.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   And then they take it further as they like at home.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.400]   - Yeah, we did something very similar to what you guys did.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.600]   We would pick, we worked on the memory work every day too.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.080]   And I had, when we started,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.400]   I had a second grader and a fifth grader.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.600]   So they were both in foundations
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.520]   and that was our first experience.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.080]   So it was all new to us.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.200]   All the memory work was new to us.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.000]   Even the strands that repeat every year, you know,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.680]   like math, it was still our first year.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.960]   And so we practiced memory work together
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.000]   and then we would use it, like you said,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.280]   as a jumping off point to decide
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.840]   what will we study for history?
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.360]   What kind of history focus will we have this week?
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.880]   What kind of science focus will we have this week?
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.480]   But I, like you, stuck really close
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.200]   to the foundation's memory work as our spine.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.640]   And I was not ever disappointed.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   I didn't find huge gaps for my girls as they got older.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:16.000]   But we did mention there are things
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.080]   that families need to add to foundations.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.520]   What are they?
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.240]   - You'll need a math of some sort and a language arts.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.320]   So although they are memorizing math facts
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.720]   and English grammar facts, they're not learning to read.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.920]   And they're, you know, through the foundations program.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.200]   So you'll need to add something
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.480]   for those two subjects specifically.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.400]   - Right.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.520]   With my younger daughter,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.080]   she was only in the second grade when we started.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.560]   So she was not a great reader.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.920]   She was still learning.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.760]   She was still gaining proficiency.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.000]   And I guess we all gain proficiency.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.760]   But she was still really working on the basics of reading.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   My older daughter was ready to do essentials.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:13.000]   And so she was getting writing practice as well.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.080]   And once your student is old enough for essentials,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   then that might very well be enough language arts
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.120]   for your family if you add essentials to it.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.360]   If your student is proficient in reading already.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.920]   So that's really good.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.400]   And I always try to tell people
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.080]   that it is a complete curriculum,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.680]   except you still need to teach your child to read
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.280]   and you still need something
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.280]   that will help you practice math computation.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.240]   So, and things like simple geometry.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.480]   But it's what my girls, when they were little,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.120]   they called it mama made math.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.560]   I mean, I went to enough practicums
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.440]   to know what are the things,
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   what are the building blocks that they need to do.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.720]   And I would just make it up.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.920]   And sometimes we would do it on a whiteboard
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   and sometimes we'd do it out on the patio in chalk.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   And sometimes we would draw, we would do math flashcards
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.120]   if they were going up and down the steps.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   We made it fun, but we did have to add a few things.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.920]   So I just mentioned the essentials program.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.760]   Tell, some folks on our call
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.520]   are already familiar with essentials.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.160]   Some have heard of it,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.480]   but they're not quite sure what to make of it.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.720]   Tell us a little bit, give us a thumbnail of essentials.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   And then I might have a couple of questions
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.560]   for you about essentials.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.000]   - Sure, essentials is a language arts program
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.480]   that meets usually in the afternoons
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.960]   after foundations is over
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.720]   for students beginning who are nine years old,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.000]   about nine to 11 years old.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.080]   And it's a three-year program that,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.040]   or it's intended to be a three-year program.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.160]   And we have several who start in their last year
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.200]   and that's okay, but it is intended to be.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.960]   But it is, we take 45 minutes for English grammar
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.800]   where we learn concepts
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   all about different parts of speech.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.720]   And we learn to diagram sentences and parse the sentences.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.640]   And then we have 45 minutes of writing.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.760]   And then we have 30 minutes of math games
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.680]   where we work on speed and accuracy for math.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.120]   So that in a nutshell is what essentials is.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   It is led by a tutor who introduces what you will do at home
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   on your community day.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.640]   They'll take you through what you will do
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.120]   after you get home and help you to know what's coming
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.400]   and what to expect for the week.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   - And so families have an essentials manual,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.360]   a curriculum, and they take home.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.880]   And there are things that they work on during the week
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.000]   that go along with what they were introduced to
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.520]   in community.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.400]   - Yes, and it really is a complete language arts curriculum
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.640]   for those ages.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.360]   Like you said, if they are proficient in reading.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.920]   So there's spelling involved.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   They have your editing or punctuation and capitalization.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.640]   It's all encompassed.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.240]   You wouldn't need something in addition to that
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.760]   once they are in the essentials program.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.600]   - That's cool.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.880]   Okay, so what would you tell parents
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.040]   who are just coming in?
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.240]   Because I've met lots of families
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.080]   who are brand new to classical education
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   and brand new to CC communities and their child is nine.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.840]   And so they've heard a nine-year-old
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.080]   should do foundations and essentials
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.120]   and they come into essentials.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.960]   And maybe the parents don't have a great English grammar
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.400]   or writing background.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.560]   But anyway, they come into essentials the first week
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.960]   and they're like, oh my goodness.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.720]   I don't even know what this tutor is talking about
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.840]   the whole time.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.600]   How am I supposed to help my child?
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.960]   What is essential to remember?
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.440]   - Well, it is essential to remember
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   that you are not intended to master
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.560]   all of the information in the first year.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.040]   You can take from it what you can
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   and then come back again.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.640]   It will repeat in the three years
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.480]   that you are in essentials.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.240]   And it's intended for you to take a little bit
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.040]   of a deeper dive each week or each year.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   And so you don't have to know really anything
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.960]   before you begin because the curriculum is there.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.360]   Your tutor is there to help as well as the other families.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.720]   So we learn from one another
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.000]   and you're not expected to be a grammarian,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.120]   an expert in English grammar.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:28.120]   I am not or was not before I began.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.960]   And I'm a nurse.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.760]   I don't have an education background either.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   And so you get what you need from the program.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.560]   You will be given what you need
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.440]   to lead your family each week.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.960]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.920]   I want to write that down.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.760]   You'll be given what you need each week.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   That is very encouraging, I believe,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.880]   for new families.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.320]   And I love what you said.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.760]   In the beginning, you started talking about essentials
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.480]   and you said it's a three-year program.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.880]   And then I love it.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.720]   You said if you don't get it the first time around,
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.280]   you'll get more of it the next two times.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.560]   So this is a three-year program,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.440]   but it's not three years of material.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.760]   It is material that you go through for three years.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.120]   You're gonna do the same thing every year.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.360]   And like you said, go deeper every year.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.640]   That's very helpful.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   I like the way you said that, Lisa.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.960]   I need to write that down as well.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.840]   - Add that to my orientation.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.720]   - It is such a classical way to learn
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   that repetition over time is what gives us mastery.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.200]   And I think that's really helpful for us as parents
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   to realize, look, it's repetition over time
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.120]   that builds mastery.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.960]   So you are not expected and you should not expect
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.520]   your student to get it all the first time.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.400]   You have to repeat it.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.280]   And it actually helps if there's some time separation
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.840]   that you're gonna see this again.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.000]   You will be a slightly different student
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.560]   the second year that you come through.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.760]   You'll have more context.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.840]   Some things will be easy for you,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.080]   and then you can breeze past those
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.840]   and narrow, hone in on the things that are harder
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.240]   or that you still aren't good at.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.200]   That's really encouraging that it's gonna take a while
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.280]   and that we should all expect it to take a while.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   And there are some kids who are more natural grammarians
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.120]   than others, and that's okay.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.200]   Your child is going to get so much out of essentials.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.360]   I know my older daughter was one of those natural readers,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.400]   natural writers.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.320]   It was like I was reminding her of something
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.600]   she already knew when I was teaching her.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.280]   My younger daughter, it didn't come as easily,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   and she bemoaned the fact that she didn't enjoy writing.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.160]   And she would say, "I'm just not a good writer.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.360]   "I'm not as good a writer as,"
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.040]   and she met her older sister.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.000]   But when she finished essentials, it was beautiful to me.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.520]   She stood up and I said, "Oh, this is such a good piece
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.880]   "of work," her last little essay.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.680]   I said, "You need to go read this to daddy."
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.240]   And she read it out loud.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.920]   And I think that as she read it out loud to herself,
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.800]   she heard it.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.080]   She heard what she had written and she got to the end
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.200]   and her eyes were so wide.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   And she said, "I can write, I am a good writer."
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.880]   And it just, it brought me to tears to think
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.200]   that just that perseverance.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.440]   And I started to say patient perseverance.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.080]   She was not always patient.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:16.080]   She didn't always want to do it, but it paid off.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.480]   And so I'm excited now about how she will parent
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.000]   and homeschool her own little children.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.360]   I'm looking forward to watching that.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:33.000]   - All right, I have just two questions to ask you.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   One is, what is the biggest misunderstanding
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.840]   about foundations that you've heard over all your years?
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.000]   - I think it's the same misunderstanding
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   that comes in two different ways.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.040]   Without an understanding of the classical model,
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.960]   really I think that's the core of it.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.720]   But people will feel that foundations is either not enough
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.840]   or too much.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.560]   And what I mean by that is that they'll feel,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.160]   they will feel like they have to add to the memory work
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.840]   with things like worksheets or tests
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.120]   or additional curriculum if they feel
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.520]   as though it's not enough.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.640]   On the other hand, some people will think
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   that maybe their six-year-old should be a memory master
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   or that their 11-year-old needs to have mastered
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.920]   every aspect of the material.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:36.600]   The memory work in foundations is meant to be a peg
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.080]   that you will later hang more information on.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:48.680]   It's not something that has to be so completely mastered
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.720]   that they can regurgitate it
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   without thinking about it every time.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.880]   - That is awesome.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.680]   That is such a good thing for us to keep in mind
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   as foundations parents, that we are building a foundation,
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.560]   but that's not the end.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.280]   That's not actually where we intend to stop.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.800]   Nobody ever goes around to say,
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.880]   well, let me just go and look
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   at this neighborhood of foundations.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.920]   No, you want to go look at a neighborhood
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.080]   of beautiful homes.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   But what we're doing in foundations is building the basis
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.160]   of what we're going to construct
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.400]   that will be beautiful later on.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.520]   That's really, really good.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.520]   So what is the key to enjoying foundations?
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.760]   - The key to enjoying foundations
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.720]   is to make play the focus.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.760]   You will find in the foundations curriculum
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.120]   that that is how it is written.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.200]   There's lots of articles at the beginning
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   and play is one of the main components of all of it.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.840]   If you play with the memory work,
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.440]   if parents and children play together with the memory work,
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.720]   then everybody is going to enjoy it.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.360]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.240]   I love that.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.360]   I have been reading, I can't find the copy of it.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.280]   Now it must be upstairs, about a book,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.400]   about play and how important it is for our children
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.040]   and how play really is the work of childhood
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.080]   and that that's what we should be about.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.360]   And the cool thing about joining a foundations community
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.920]   is that your tutor will model ways to make
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.480]   quote unquote, just memory work fun and like play.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.120]   And so that's the perfect place to end.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.560]   That was a great encouragement, Courtney, to us.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.640]   If play is the focus,
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.520]   then we can all enjoy our foundations day.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.960]   I really like that.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.880]   I really also want to highlight one other thing
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.720]   that Courtney said.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.520]   There's lots of joy to be found in reading with your kids.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.640]   If you just read about the things
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.200]   that are part of foundations memory work,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.680]   you will learn so much together and reading together,
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.160]   especially as part of a gentle easing into the day
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   during morning time can be just such a revival
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.720]   of family relationships for your family.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.000]   I want to remind you guys that Copper Lodge Library
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   is a great book series that helps us present
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.760]   timeless stories to families
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.720]   that they can read and use together
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.520]   and build their storehouse of memories,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.280]   but also build family relationships as they read.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.120]   They are collections of stories.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.560]   We've got echoes, the echoes readers,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.520]   lots of fairy tales and poems and folk tales.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.960]   We have stories of Rome that give the history
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.000]   of Western civilization.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.120]   When they study the history of Rome,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.160]   we have Uncle Paul readers
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.640]   that delve into all kinds of science topics
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.720]   that your children will find fascinating.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.400]   And then there are even Copper Lodge Library editions
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.920]   of classical literature that you might want to read aloud
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.400]   with your children,
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.000]   even though they're not assigned to study it this year.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.440]   The Copper Lodge Library offers collections of stories
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.520]   that will help you build community.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.200]   So if you wonder what titles are out there
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.640]   and what you could add to your morning read aloud time,
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.520]   go to copperlodgelibrary.com
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.400]   and see what we've got to offer, okay?
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.680]   And I will give you guys a heads up,
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.240]   next week on the "Everyday Educator" podcast,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.400]   I'm gonna be talking to Amy Jones
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.200]   and we're gonna dive a little bit more deeply
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.760]   into this whole idea of morning time
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.200]   and what do you do with it?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.720]   So that thing that Courtney mentioned
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.720]   is gonna be explained more detail next week on the podcast.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.480]   So Courtney, thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.680]   I really appreciate you sharing your wisdom
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.320]   and your inspiration with our listeners.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.440]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.760]   I enjoyed our time, Lisa.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.600]   - I'm glad.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.480]   All right, see you guys next week.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.800]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
