[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.120]   I mentioned, I think it was last year,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.440]   last December sometime back in APJ 1720,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.120]   that in our emails, the most asked about chapter
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.600]   of the Bible is Romans 9, and it's not even close,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.160]   understandably so.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.520]   The chapter raises a truckload of theology questions,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.360]   and within that chapter, Romans 9 22, verse 22,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.080]   is the most mentioned text, the most asked about verse
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.800]   in our entire inbox, because that verse raises
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.580]   the difficult but necessary topic of predestination
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.320]   and double predestination or reprobation,
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   the divine design of, quote,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, end quote.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.560]   To sobering text, to raising many questions,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.960]   relevant and important questions.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.400]   We're not in that text in particular today,
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.200]   but we are back on the theme of double predestination
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.140]   through a different text in a question
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.840]   from a listener named Josh.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.780]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for all your resources
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.920]   for people like me seeking Bible answers.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.720]   I have a question about 1 Timothy 2, 4,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.640]   and how it, when read in context,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.680]   pertains to the doctrine of double predestination.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.720]   To me, double predestination seems a logical result
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.300]   of the doctrine of predestination,
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.880]   but this verse seems to refute it.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.040]   How do double predestination and this verse
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.580]   hold up together?
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.240]   Also, if addressing 1 Peter 2, 8 would be applicable,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.880]   I would appreciate that as well.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920]   My understanding of one verse contradicts
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800]   my understanding of the other.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.520]   I know the Bible is cohesive,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   but I'm unsure how to reconcile these texts.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.640]   - Yes, the Bible is cohesive.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   It is coherent.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   It has integrity.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.320]   So that's a good assumption to start with.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   1 Timothy 2, 4 has been perceived for centuries
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.680]   as a problem, not just for double predestination,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.040]   but for any predestination
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   or any unconditional election of who will be saved.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   So let me say a word about double predestination,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   since it's brought up in the question,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.360]   and then show how I think 1 Timothy 2, 4
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.520]   is not a contradiction of predestination
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.680]   or double predestination.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   Predestination refers to God's appointing
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.400]   the final destiny of a person before creation.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.360]   So for example, Ephesians 1, 4 and 5,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.720]   that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   In love, he predestined us for adoption
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.080]   to himself as sons through Jesus Christ
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.240]   according to the purpose of his will.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   So God assigns or destines the elect for adoption.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.920]   That's the destiny.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.520]   He plans for his chosen ones before creation.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   Hence the term predestined,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.600]   destined beforehand for adoption.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   These predestined ones always correspond in real life
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.360]   with those whom Jesus calls to himself
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   and those who believe on Jesus and are justified by faith.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.880]   And we know that, we know that the predestined
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.960]   and the believers always correspond
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.240]   because of Romans 8, 30, which says,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.020]   "Those whom he predestined, he also called,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.040]   and those whom he called, he also justified."
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.360]   And we know that justification is by faith in no other way.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.200]   So those are believers.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.760]   Those whom he called, he brought to faith and justified.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.280]   And those whom he justified, he glorified.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.600]   So the predestined ones
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.280]   and those who are justified by faith in Jesus
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   are always the same group
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.240]   because God not only predestines,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.480]   he also calls people to himself and brings them to faith
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.100]   and justifies them and finally glorifies them.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.720]   There are no predestined ones who do not believe
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.600]   and there are no believers who are not predestined.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.360]   God is sovereign in the whole process of salvation,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.520]   beginning to end, eternity to eternity
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.760]   in every aspect of it.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.800]   Now, the term double predestination
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.560]   is used to refer to the fact
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   that if God destines some for salvation and adoption,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.680]   then he passes over others
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.960]   so that their destiny is judgment and not salvation.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.880]   Now, some people think we should not call this passing over
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   a second predestination
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.720]   since the Bible does not speak of it that way.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   And I would agree that we at least shouldn't make a focus
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   out of what the Bible does not make a focus.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   But in fact, while not using the word predestined
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.020]   for unbelievers who perish,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.080]   the Bible does refer to the reality of it.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.280]   And it's not just a logical deduction.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.120]   Sometimes this gets a bad rap
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.240]   because they say, "Here you go,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   applying your crusty wooden cold logic,"
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.480]   which the Bible doesn't do.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.520]   Well, forget that.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.560]   We're not talking about a logical deduction here.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.800]   We're talking about texts.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.240]   For example, consider these three texts,
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.300]   1 Peter 2, 8, which is the one that was mentioned,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.400]   refers to those who stumble
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.920]   because they disobey the word
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.620]   as they were destined to do.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.340]   Romans 9, 22 refers to those whom God endured
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.720]   with much patience,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.400]   vessels of wrath prepared for destruction.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.120]   Proverbs 16, 4 says,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.080]   "The Lord has made everything for its purpose,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.860]   even the wicked for the day of trouble."
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.840]   Now, each of those texts needs careful attention
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.760]   and true interpretation,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.080]   but my effort over the years has yielded to fact
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.840]   that I think they do in fact teach
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   that God plans the destiny of each person,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.240]   whether judgment or salvation.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.360]   And that, of course, is very controversial,
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.120]   but it's also very important.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.720]   I mean, think of it.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.940]   It's not marginal.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.800]   Think of what it says about the sovereignty of God.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.480]   Either way, about the nature of saving grace
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.520]   and its power, its sovereign effectiveness.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.120]   Think about the implications for prayer and evangelism
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.040]   and assurance and so many other things.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.360]   This is not a marginal issue
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   as though you could just shunt that aside and say,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.400]   we'll just talk about other things.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.280]   Now, the primary objection
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.640]   to this biblical teaching of predestination,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   whether you call it single or double,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.040]   the primary objection
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   is that it seems to result in people being punished
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.920]   when they are not morally accountable.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.300]   So this seems to be unjust.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.700]   It seems unjust to people and unjust in God.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.260]   The alternative view says
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.140]   that God does not decide anyone's destiny
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.140]   before they exercise their ultimately self-determination.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.660]   Self-determining free will.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.940]   The assumption of this alternative view
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.460]   is that a person cannot be morally accountable
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.540]   unless each one has ultimate self-determination,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.780]   which is usually called free will,
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.780]   but ultimate self-determination is the crucial definition.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.780]   The text that most often is appealed to for this view,
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.780]   which is not my view, I'm not in favor of this.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.060]   The text that's most often appealed to for this view
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.020]   is 1 Timothy 2.4,
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.340]   which Josh specifically asks about.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.340]   It says, "God desires all people to be saved
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   and to come to a knowledge of the truth."
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:35.180]   Then the inference, by those who read it,
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.460]   is drawn from this verse
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.460]   that God cannot choose only some to be saved
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.020]   because he desires all to be saved.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.520]   Now, the problem is this.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.620]   Both interpretations admit
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.980]   that God prioritizes something
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.500]   above his desire for all to be saved
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.540]   because all are not saved.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:11.940]   Something restrains God from saving all.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.740]   And one view says that what restrains God
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.380]   is that he prioritizes
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.260]   ultimate human self-determination above saving all.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260]   Better to have some perish
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.180]   than that all should be deprived
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.380]   of ultimate self-determination,
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.900]   usually called free will.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.780]   The other view says that what restrains God,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.940]   this would be my view,
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.700]   that what restrains God from saving all
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.380]   is that he prioritizes the glory of the freedom
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.820]   of his sovereign grace above saving all.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.420]   Better that some perish
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.100]   than that the freedom and greatness of God's grace
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.940]   be diminished.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.860]   So the question is,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.540]   which of these two explanations
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.260]   is the biblical explanation
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.580]   of why God doesn't save everybody?
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.980]   Is it God's commitment
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.140]   to ultimate human self-determination
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.380]   or is it God's commitment to his own freedom
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.100]   and the glory of his predestining grace?
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.900]   Now that's a massive question,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.700]   but let me give one pointer
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.420]   from inside Paul's letters to Timothy.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.660]   I'm very, very jealous here
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.220]   not to be controlled by a system.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.900]   I know that whatever view you have,
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.740]   it is very easy to be controlled
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.900]   by other truths besides the text you're dealing with
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.540]   rather than looking in the context
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.020]   to see what it really means.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.460]   So I wanna stick with these,
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.940]   what are called pastoral letters of Paul.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.740]   Let's just take 1 and 2 Timothy
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.580]   and show how close the language is
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.020]   between 2-4 in 1 Timothy
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.740]   and 2-25 in 2 Timothy.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.380]   So in 2 Timothy 2-24 and 25,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.020]   Paul uses language like this.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.380]   And what's close about it is the phrase
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.540]   coming to a knowledge of the truth in both texts.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.180]   But here's what he says.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.580]   The servant of the Lord should correct his opponents
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.180]   with gentleness.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.060]   God may perhaps grant them repentance
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.660]   leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.820]   Same phrase as in 1 Timothy 2-4.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.020]   Now what seems clear to me from this verse
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.860]   is that Paul does not believe
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.020]   in ultimate human self-determination
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.580]   when it comes to the all-important act of repentance.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.380]   In this verse, repentance does not
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.020]   ultimately depend on human self-determination.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.780]   It depends on the free gift of God
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.740]   to a person in the bondage of sin, Satan.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.420]   God may grant, God may grant them repentance
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.180]   leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.500]   Therefore, within these two letters of Paul to Timothy,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.180]   he shows that what keeps God from doing
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.700]   what he at one level desires to do,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.020]   namely save all,
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.420]   is not his commitment to ultimate human self-determination.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.300]   No one is saved unless God grants repentance.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.380]   Repentance is not the product
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.420]   of ultimate human self-determination.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.700]   It's a gift of God.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.180]   Now here's the paradox.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.740]   Not contradiction, paradox.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.220]   Lots of people try to make this out to be
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.500]   a logical contradiction.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.620]   It's not.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.060]   It runs through the whole Bible.
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.420]   Human beings are morally accountable
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.620]   even though they do not have ultimate self-determination.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.260]   There is no injustice with God, Romans 9, 14.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.380]   No one is punished who does not truly deserve to be punished.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.260]   And the measure of the punishment is always
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:42.740]   in righteous proportion to the measure of the evil.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.500]   Though God predestines who will be saved
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.620]   and who will not be saved,
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:55.260]   no one comes into judgment who does not deserve judgment.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.620]   This is not a logical contradiction,
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.980]   which so many try to make it out to be.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.700]   It is a mystery.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.780]   I don't think the Bible makes plain
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.700]   how both of these truths,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.420]   God's sovereignty and man's accountability,
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.580]   are in perfect compatibility.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.260]   But the whole Bible testifies to both truths.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.060]   They are compatible.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.300]   The Bible teaches the truth of both.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.740]   And they are profoundly important to embrace
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.220]   for the good of our souls
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.980]   and for the integrity of God's Word
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.660]   and for the health of the church
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.180]   and for the advancement of God's mission
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.260]   and for the glory of God's grace.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.940]   Yeah, not questions to be stuffed aside and ignored.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.260]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.100]   And thank you for the question, Josh.

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.740]   Well, we've talked briefly about lament on the podcast, lament,
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.300]   particularly about being angry with God.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.980]   You can see APJ 931 for that,
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.380]   since that episode, 931,
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.260]   which compares godly lament with ungodly lament.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.820]   Several questions have come in on this,
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.980]   a lot of follow-up questions.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.540]   It's another topic we can't ignore,
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.580]   and it's up next time.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.860]   I'm your host, Tony Renke,
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.140]   and we'll see you back here on Monday
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.500]   for the topic of lament.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.460]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.060]   (upbeat music)
