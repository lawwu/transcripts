[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   I've seen a lot of people talk about monk mode.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.160]   Does this actually work?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.720]   Monk mode meaning you sort of, I first heard this from Greg McKeown where he like I'm disappearing.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.040]   I'm going to like a shed for a month and all I'm doing is writing.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.140]   Adam Grant.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.960]   So I wrote about this in deep work.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.440]   I called it the monastic mode of deep work.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.880]   Or maybe called the bimodal mode.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960]   I confused these up, but I was thinking about Adam Grant where he would have periods of
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   the year where he would just disappear to work on research, be out of touch and other
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560]   periods where he was back.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.040]   So monk mode I guess is spreading online again.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.440]   I think you might have the same take on this as I do, which is it's less about monk mode
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.160]   working to me than it is the way the hyperactive hive mind constantly context switching that
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.720]   we call normal work today, how bad that is.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720]   Like monk mode is just escaping from that.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.080]   So like me and you, I know neither of us disappear to cabins for six months the right.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.540]   But I think we're just much more careful in general in making our day-to-day work something
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.400]   that we don't have to escape so dramatically from.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   Trying to just in general see, I don't want to just constantly be context switching between
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   a lot of things.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.600]   So we don't have as much to escape from.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   I don't know.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   What do you say?
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   You don't escape to a cabin, right?
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.920]   I think of you as being pretty careful about how you work.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.280]   I mean, I think, so again, I think I don't place so much emphasis on the retreat into
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   the wilderness.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.480]   Not that that's always bad, but just to me, sometimes that can also be a little bit of
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   a fantasy distracting from what the real problem is.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.640]   Like, well, the problem is that I'm in this physical location, like sometimes, but usually
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.360]   the problem is in your head, right?
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.720]   Usually the problem is not like, well, that you couldn't do any deep work here, but that
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040]   it's hard and it's like easier to like open your phone and do that kind of thing.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.400]   And so I do think it's not necessarily monk mode, but one thing that I noticed, especially
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.280]   when I embark on like bigger, cognitively challenging projects, and maybe you can attest
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.720]   to this Cal, is that, you know, right now, for instance, I am in the kind of promotional
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   mode for my books.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.200]   I'm like emailing every old friend and being like, hey, you know, like I've got a new book.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.280]   Can I send it to you?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040]   And it's, it is like a hive mind kind of thing.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.920]   I open my email and there's lots of little communications and like, who do I have to
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   message?
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.880]   You know, it's very extroverted, socially focused, this kind of thing.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.920]   But when I'm writing the book, I find that the challenge is that, okay, I've got like
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.400]   this 30 page dense paper to read that I think is important for me to read, but it's a little
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   boring.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.600]   You know, it's not like this is, this isn't a Harry Potter book or something like, you
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.360]   know, murder mystery novel or something like, I'm not just churning through the pages.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.280]   I'm like, wait, what's that word?
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.760]   And I'm going to look up keywords and like, oh, maybe this citation, this kind of thing.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.200]   And so I think the real challenge that we have in doing, you know, work that, that requires
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.120]   cognitive demands is that you're sitting and maybe you want to like read for three hours
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   straight.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.720]   But after like 15 minutes, your brain is telling you, you know what, maybe go on Twitter, maybe,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   maybe check that email inbox.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.660]   Maybe there's some distraction that would be like a, like a break from doing this kind
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.660]   of work.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so I think what, what this kind of monk mode or something akin to that can be helpful
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   for is that you have to sort of shift yourself into a mode where you are getting used to
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280]   doing that kind of work.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.860]   It's a little bit like training for a marathon.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.040]   Like if you don't run ever and then you run for 20 minutes, your lungs are screaming,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   your body's tired.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   It's like, okay, I've got to stop.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   Now.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   I don't think that past a certain point, it's so much that your physical fitness is increasing.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   It's just, you're learning to switch off that part of your brain.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.160]   That's like, do something else, do something else, do something else.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.280]   And so I think when you get into this or like, I need to do a lot of deep work mode, I think
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.040]   it is helpful to kind of create some constraints around your work so that you're prioritizing
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   this deep work.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   You're able to get longer stretches in, you're able to just like, okay, I just sat and I
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.760]   read all day and it wasn't like agony that does take a little bit of building up to get
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   to.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.960]   And so I think, you know, that that's where this can be helpful is if like, if you're
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.040]   in the cabin in the woods, you don't have the friends, this kind of thing, maybe it's
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.260]   sometimes easier to, to, to transition to doing that.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.080]   But I think the transition to doing that is, is what's really important.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.360]   I love the practice message.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   I love what you're saying, right?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   So what supports it?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   I'm in slow productivity.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.400]   I talk about rituals and location, have a separate location where you do the monk mode
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   work.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   It doesn't have to be a dramatically different location, but it's okay.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.360]   Instead of being at the home office desk, I go to the screened in porch, you know, but
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.620]   it's a place that I only associate and then have rituals.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.800]   You know, I go for a walk, I make a certain amount of tea that helps, but I love this
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.900]   idea.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.920]   The more you practice, the better you get.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.480]   This is connected to your book though, right, Scott, because what is all the, the, the key
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.340]   efforts in mastery that you talk about are efforts that require sustained concentration.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.280]   And that's something you have to be, you get used to, right?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.240]   Like the more used to your, like, I just do this on a regular basis.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.840]   There's periods of my day where I'm just locked in on something and I'm not distracted and
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.840]   it's kind of hard.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.160]   I mean, I talk about this in deep work, right?
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.760]   The the more comfortable you are with that, the more comfortable you'll be with learning
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   something hard.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.740]   It's the same basic cognitive muscles are, are being stretched.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.720]   So I'm assuming that you would, you would see the same problem where if I live a full
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.740]   Linda stone, partial continuous attention lifestyle, I'm just constantly moving back
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.740]   and forth.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.800]   I'm not very comfortable focusing.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.340]   If I then say, you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to start learning something
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.160]   really hard.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.380]   I'm going to struggle in just the sense that my mind is not used to the feeling of cognitive
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.480]   strain that is going to be involved in learning something hard.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.500]   I mean, I think, so one of the things that I find important in this regard is, uh, when
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.180]   you, when you're approaching this kind of task, it is helpful to like be more deliberate
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.300]   about, you know, we do this in our course life of focus where you are being very explicit
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.980]   about like, these are my deep work hours.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.100]   You put the computer away, but you kind of remove yourself physically from those distractions.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.700]   It doesn't have to be a different location, but it can just be some way that you're pushing
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.220]   them away because I think as you build the skill, the way I think of it is it's, it's
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.740]   a little bit like, um, you know, it gets thrown around too much, but like addiction and this
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.180]   motivational hardwiring is very similar that, you know, if you were a gambling addict and
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.980]   you're like, Oh, I'm going to go like live right next to the casino, it would be very
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.780]   difficult when you're in the habit of going to the slot machines all the time to resist
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.780]   that.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.920]   So you might want to get yourself removed from it.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.980]   Don't have any reminders.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.820]   Don't have any things that's going to make you think about doing this, but then maybe
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.100]   once you've done it more and more, it would be fine.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   Okay.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.100]   I just don't gamble.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   I don't think about that.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.540]   I don't want to go through Las Vegas and not feel as much temptation.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.460]   And so similarly with deep work, I think some of the difficulty is that if you're not used
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.980]   to the sustained cognitive effort, maybe because it's a new role, new task, new project, this
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.980]   kind of thing, like it can be exhausting, but it's also what is exhausting about it
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.500]   is your kind of your motivational hardwiring being like, this is easier, this is more fun,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.620]   this is more appealing and that actually you can, that will quiet down if you can stick
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620]   to it.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.900]   And so that's sort of that, that transition can be hard, I think, for people.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.820]   And you have to believe that that's going to happen.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.340]   That after you do it for three months, oh, actually sitting and reading for four hours
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.540]   straight is doable by a normal person.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.740]   You don't have to be some kind of like savant-like focused person to do it.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.740]   I like that.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.740]   Shrink monk mode.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   Monk mode doesn't have to be this month.
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.540]   I'm going to monk mode.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.060]   You have a little bit of monk mode every day.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.020]   That's sort of, okay, these are, I have a monk hour here.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.380]   I mean, you start with like a monk half hour, I have like a monkish morning.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.380]   Monkish morning.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.380]   I used that phrase somewhere.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.580]   God, I've written too many things, but somewhere, somewhere I used this phrase, monk mode morning.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.900]   And it was a CEO who ran his own sort of small company.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.100]   It was like a 15 person thing.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.900]   And I remember this was his thing, monk mode morning.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.820]   And he said, no one can schedule anything with me until I figure out what it was.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.300]   But it was like 10, 30 or 11.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   And he's like, that's it.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.080]   We just, let's just work around that.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.100]   But until 10, 30 or 11, I don't plug into anything.
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.100]   I'm just like working on it.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.620]   And he's like, it transformed everything.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:03.500]   That regular drumbeat of the uninterrupted allowed him to make progress on a lot of the
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.580]   big things that really mattered.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580]   And he got a lot better at it.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.200]   And then it really made a difference for the business.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.220]   And it turns out having to wait until 10, 30 or 11 before you can call or get an email
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.140]   response or set up a meeting with someone, people adjusted.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.460]   It wasn't a big deal, but the benefit was.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.140]   So monk mode morning.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.140]   I remember that.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   M cubed.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   All right.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.740]   Here's a long question, but it's interesting.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.340]   I think you might have a quick answer, but okay.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.100]   Adam, look at this.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.380]   This is our third, a name.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   I always interested in that.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.380]   We have three A's.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.620]   - You sorted alphabetically when you were bringing the sheet here.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.740]   - In my archive text-based planning system, I sorted alphabetically.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.740]   All right.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.220]   Adam says, in my earlier years, I thrived on structure and processes.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.500]   Crossing things off was therapeutic and enabled me to get a lot done.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.780]   Fast forward to 2024, and in my work, a lot of the time, a task isn't as simple as, you
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.220]   know, task A complete or not complete.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.300]   Task A actually involves a series of 10 or 15 steps with various blockers, context and
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.620]   definitions of completion.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.220]   I've delved in the productivity applications, but none seem to be the all-in-one solution
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.740]   I'm looking for.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.980]   This has led to looking to AI as a savior, but I'm now realizing that the rudimentary
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.020]   large language models don't solve the problem.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.140]   Am I better off going back to basics in this time of technology apps and AI growth and
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.500]   trusting my process, or should I pick just one program and become an expert with it?
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.820]   Well, my listeners know I'm going to say, go back to basics.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.020]   An app is not a substitute for a process.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.340]   You have to figure out, what am I working on?
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.420]   How do I want to work on it?
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.180]   What do I have to keep track of it?
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.740]   And then go find the tools to implement that.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.500]   And nine times out of 10, those tools are going to be boring.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.180]   It's going to be a Google Doc, maybe a Trello board, right?
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.380]   It's not going to be that interesting.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.460]   And mainly, I mean, look, it looks like, Adam, you kind of have been up to now, you're used
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.780]   to like what we call productivity light, the sort of zero to one binary flip from I just
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.620]   am completely reactive to I keep track of things, I cross things off.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.980]   I sometimes think of this as like bullet journal productivity.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.980]   It's nice.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.980]   It looks good.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.620]   I keep track of the books I've read and what I want to work on today, and I can illustrate
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.060]   the borders.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.660]   When you get into these high-end knowledge work jobs, productivity light doesn't cut
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.020]   it anymore.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.620]   Your bullet journal can't keep up with 75 emails a day.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.100]   It can't keep up with the administrative overhead of a shifting array of 12 ongoing projects.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.980]   It can't keep up with a calendar that's averaging 20 to 40 events per week.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.060]   The systems, you have to go from productivity light to productivity heavy.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.660]   But it's the process that rules.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   I don't use any complicated software.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.740]   I use Google Docs.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.740]   I use my calendar.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.740]   I use Trello.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:56.380]   So you figure out how do I organize and have a process for working this work, and then
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   you find the tools.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.260]   I have some concrete suggestions, but Scott, like you're, I mean, you don't have a, you
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.940]   don't work in a complex process-oriented knowledge work job.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.780]   So from kind of from the outside, like what's your take on this idea of like the tool, you
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.860]   know, is there the right tool I need that's going to solve this versus other ways of thinking
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.220]   about organizing effort?
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.980]   Well, so I'm not sure if it's Adam, right?
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   Adam's the question.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   Adam, that's right.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   Yeah, Adam.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.100]   I'm not sure if my experience directly parallels Adam, but I'll share it anyways.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.900]   But I found for me, you know, and maybe you can comment on this as well, Cal, that when
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.860]   I got interested in productivity, when I was like first doing it, this kind of checklist-based
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.420]   approach just seemed like that's what productivity was.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.260]   You write down all your tasks and then you check them off.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.500]   And especially if you're a student, it's like read this chapter, complete this essay, do
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   this kind of stuff.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.260]   It really fits that mold.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.180]   And now when I think about my work, two things have changed.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.780]   One is that I've gotten to the somewhat enviable position that a lot of the checklist-based
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.860]   stuff have been delegated.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.060]   I don't have the checklist-based tasks anymore.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.540]   Someone else does the like, here's the, you know, eight mechanical steps you have to do
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.460]   every single time you do this and they check it off.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.020]   I don't do them anymore.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.820]   But then what was left, what was remaining was this core of like these hard problems
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.060]   that is sort of like, they're not, they're not something you can just check off.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.940]   It's sort of like, okay, write a bestselling book.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.940]   Okay.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.940]   What's the tasks there?
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.940]   I mean, you could make a task list, but the thing is you're going to start working on
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.420]   the tasks and realize, no, that's not the right way to do it.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.900]   Or you're not doing it properly.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.940]   You certainly can't approach it with the mindset of like, just check off this one and move
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.940]   to the next one.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.500]   And then you're going to have a bestselling book or you're going to have something successful
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.500]   here.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.080]   So for me, I think I naturally gravitated more and more as I get older, as my career
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.420]   matures to the kind of deep work sort of system that, you know, what I'm trying to do is ensure
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:52.020]   that there is a deep focus on important tasks and that there is a lot of flexibility in
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.420]   how those get executed.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.340]   And I'm, I'm not really like trying to break it down into, okay, well, I've just got to
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.340]   do these 10 little things.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.820]   I mean, I still do that.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.140]   I still have that sort of segregated somewhere else, but what I'm really trying to do is
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.900]   like, how can I have like six hours to just work on this book chapter and like grind through
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900]   it and think through it?
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.260]   And like, in the moment, I'm constantly going back and forth between research and doing
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.540]   this and it's problem solving.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.620]   Like there's no template I can follow.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.580]   But the enemy of that is, well, I'm going to just, I'm going to spend 30 minutes and
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.060]   write 500 words every day.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.620]   Like that kind of mindset that you see so often on Twitter of like, you know, I don't
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.940]   know, I was reading somewhere, someone was saying like, you know, you could write a book
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:36.300]   every three months, because if you write this many words per day, then that totals a book.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.180]   And then I was just thinking, well, you know, I like, good for you if that's how you could
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.180]   write books.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.620]   But I mean, for me, it's, it's, it's not the metric.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.620]   It's not the metric.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.620]   Sometimes you can write 5,000 words.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.420]   Sometimes you spend days trying to figure out the opening sentence.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:55.100]   And so I think this shift towards harder, more ambiguous tasks that have complexity
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   built into it.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.560]   I think to me, that's why the kind of a little bit more using the time metric, a little bit
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.380]   more using this is the chunk of time that I'm devoting to this, this is what chunk of
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.540]   time I'm going to push everything else off of so that I'm not having interruptions, distractions
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.660]   has been more important to me.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.720]   But I mean, you can weigh in on this.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.060]   You have a lot more like multiple job descriptions, responsibilities, counter interference.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.980]   But I mean, I think it reflects your time block planning to some extent.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.180]   I mean, if we use the terminology like shallow versus deep productivity, deep being like
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.140]   the really complicated jobs, and I'll give you an example, I'm going to give you four,
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.820]   four processes that like you probably need all four of these.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.740]   And for each of these, the tech to implement it is boring, right?
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.740]   Okay.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.360]   So just based on my experience with these type of jobs, I've been dealing with people
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   with these type of jobs.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.960]   The first of all, you need some sort of structured task management, right?
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.940]   So you need a place of keeping track on your different projects, what needs to be done,
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.140]   where you can collect relevant information.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.860]   So if someone sends you a file about that task, you're waiting to work on or sends you
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.780]   an email about it, you can add it to where that thing lives.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.500]   So all the information lives in one place.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.180]   Why I call this structured is because you can have, I use Trello for this, you can use
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.540]   a Google Doc for this.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.920]   You want to have categories, right?
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.260]   So here's like tasks for a particular projects.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.700]   Here's tasks that I'm trying to work on this week.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.260]   Critically, here are things I'm waiting to hear back from other people on.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.740]   So you have a place for, I'm waiting to hear back from this person on this.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.180]   Once I hear back from this, then I can move on and do this, right?
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:28.180]   So you can keep track of, here's all the stuff that I know so far needs to get done for the
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.940]   various things I'm working on.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.900]   Relevant information can live right there with the task.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.300]   And I can have different categories here of just like, these are tasks for this project,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.060]   but I'm not actively doing them.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.340]   Here's tasks I'm working on this week.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.820]   Here's things I'm waiting on.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.700]   Any sort of thing can hold this information.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.900]   You could have a Google Docs for different types of projects.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.340]   You can have a Trello board with different boards for different types of projects or
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.340]   roles.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.260]   The technology is boring, but you need something like that.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.620]   You probably need to do multi-scale planning at this level of complexity, Adam, right?
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.960]   So for the quarter, you check in, like, what are the big things I'm working on?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.380]   You check that quarterly plan every week when you make your weekly plan, all right?
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.100]   So which of these things am I trying to make progress on this week?
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.140]   When am I doing it?
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.100]   Do I need to move some meetings around so I have some more open time?
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.420]   Do I need to add some new meetings to my calendar to make progress on it?
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.700]   What's my game plan this week for making progress on the things I want to make progress on?
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.540]   And then you have a daily time block plan where you look at the weekly plan.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.200]   So you are grappling with the things you need to do at multiple scales.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   The other thing I think you need, Adam, is to work with non-interruptive communication.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.380]   So if you have a bunch of things going on like this, the real enemy, if we're going
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.580]   to get into Weed's Deep Productivity nerd stuff, the real enemy is going to be the context
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.580]   switches.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.500]   If you have six ongoing projects that are each generating emails and Slack messages
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.840]   that you pretty much have to see and respond to pretty quickly because that's how things
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.620]   are being worked out, you are sabotaging your ability to actually do this work.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.580]   And so you need to have structured communication.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.120]   This means daily office hours.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.580]   Anything that requires more than a one-message response, you say, just grab me at my office
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.580]   hours.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.940]   We'll do a five-minute real-time conversation, figure this out.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.100]   The various groups you work with have to have standing maybe twice a week meetings to just
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.100]   go through a lot of things at once.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.140]   You should have a docket for each of these groups.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.940]   As people think up things that there's a question or something we have to figure out, you add
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.100]   it to the docket.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.860]   And when you get to the meeting, you go through that docket one by one so you don't have to
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.900]   email people or Slack people when something comes up that you worry about, you throw it
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.900]   on the docket.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.260]   None of this stuff requires big tech, right?
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.900]   Office hours requires that you open up a Zoom window and keep your door open.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.340]   A docket is a Google Doc or a Dropbox where you have a text file in it, right?
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   So I'm giving you these examples, Adam, not because that's the magic collection, but these
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.460]   are things that work really well.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.660]   So they're representative of the type of deep productivity processes that work in these
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.820]   complicated knowledge work jobs.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.220]   None of them require complicated tech, and they're certainly not unified in some sort
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.420]   of master tool that's going to do this work for you.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.860]   In the end, it's still you doing planning at multiple scales and executing.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.560]   This stuff helps keep things organized, but it's still you doing this work.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.500]   The tech is not that interesting.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.740]   So I come back to that, Silicon Valley wants us to believe the tool is what will give us
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.740]   the productivity.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.180]   And I wrote a New Yorker piece about this last fall.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.220]   It's the other way around, that we figure out what we need to be productive and then
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220]   go and find the tools.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.980]   The problem is most of those tools have already been invented and are very low cost.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.460]   So this is not great for the Silicon Valley companies.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.140]   Google Workspaces is not that expensive, like that plus Trello.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.140]   You don't need any more.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:44.140]   Email, like email, you can send files back and forth and you're good, you know, monday.com
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.340]   isn't even needed.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.680]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
