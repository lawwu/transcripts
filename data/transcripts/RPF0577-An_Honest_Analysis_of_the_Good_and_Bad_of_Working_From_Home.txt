I mean, I think it's a great way to show that, you know, we have a lot of people that are not willing to live in a particular government by building your life in such a way that you can move outside of the taxing authorities, etc. There are significant benefits to being able to do work that's not geographically restricted. And some of, I guess, frankly, the last reason is just that it's always been a better perceived lifestyle. I've always wanted my Monday mornings not to be painful.

And so when I'm in the home and coming and going from the kitchen to get a cup of coffee or a glass of water or a snack, then I'm there but I'm not emotionally available in the same way that I am at other times. And that took time, that took work, and that was a significant challenge to be able to do.

[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   The microphone here at Radical Personal Finance has been silent over the last few weeks and there have been a number of reasons for that. But one of the major reasons is just simply that I couldn't figure out how and where to get work done. I didn't have an office space, I didn't have anything set up. I have solved that problem I think. Today is my first day in my new mobile office space and I think it'll work out well. And thus far today's experience has been proving that I was right. But I'm not emotionally available in the same way that I am at other times. And that's why I'm here.

Or I'm concerned about something or I'm stressed about a major decision. And then I come home and it's hard for me to put a smile on my face and say, "Hi honey, I'm home." My wife and I have this little tradition that it's silly, but I do the way of transitioning to let her know that I'm here and available is I come out the door and I say, "Hi honey, I'm home."

I think that's the best type of work from home environment to have. It's really nice to have a separate facility for working. That solves some of those family problems. That solves some of the ability to get meaningful work done with young children around.
