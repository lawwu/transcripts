[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.140]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.820]   My name is Joshua, and today I want to share with you some ideas about the good and bad
[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.160]   of working from home, an honest analysis of the topic.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.760]   I think this will serve you if you've ever thought, "Man, I wish I had a different circumstance
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   than I'm in right now."
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.560]   I know for me, the idea of working from home, the idea of an independent livelihood has
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.000]   been something that I wanted for years, literally since I was about 15 years old.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.320]   I've wanted to work from home.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.920]   I always had an image of a guy with a laptop being able to make a living.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.720]   I was in my middle teenage years during the time when it was first becoming more prominent
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   that some people were figuring out how to make their living at the end of a laptop.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.520]   That was in the late '90s at that time.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.180]   I remember being intrigued and entranced by that particular topic.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.320]   My brothers and I were very interested in figuring out how to make money on the internet,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.520]   and again, all through our teens.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.320]   By the way, we all succeeded, which kind of shows the power of goal setting.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.560]   I thought I would be able to take it in a year or two or a few years.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.640]   Unfortunately, the Get Rich Quick courses that I bought and the how to make a billion
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.600]   dollars from your internet, from your computer, a lot of that stuff didn't work out.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.200]   It was a much more circuitous route than I ever anticipated, but in time, I did achieve
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   it.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.360]   However, just like with many goals, I've learned that working from home can be built
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.040]   up to be too much of a utopia.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.780]   It's really not.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.160]   It's really not a utopia.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.840]   I can remember sitting in an office and just hating being there and being very frustrated
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.400]   with being there.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   I thought the only solution was to be able to work from home, and yet I'm here to share
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.040]   with you that's not the only solution.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   I think in the course of my presentation to you here today, you'll hear a very balanced
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.760]   and honest perspective on the good and the bad of working from home.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.400]   I'd like to begin with sharing with you the reasons why I always wanted to work from home.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.940]   The first part of that was I always wanted to be able to be available for and invested
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.720]   in the lives of my children.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.080]   I've always desired to have this very integrated family unit.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.360]   By my analysis, I think that a fragmented family unit is one of the most destructive
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   trends in our modern culture.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.560]   Very frequently, if you consider a family unit, you'll have a dad and a mom and children
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.920]   who, if they are together, physically together, which is increasingly rare as families continue
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.120]   to splinter, if they are together, their lives are frequently not organized together.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.280]   Dad has his ideas about what is involved in his life.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.620]   He's got his work.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.060]   He's got his work buddies that he hangs out with.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.240]   He's got his work goals, and he doesn't think that much about mom's goals or the children's
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   goals.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.920]   Mom has her work life, and she has her work buddies and her life there, and they're not
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.400]   really connected.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840]   Frequently, mothers and fathers who are in that circumstance might try to coordinate
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.680]   their calendars for family vacation, but there's not really a shared sense of purpose.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   Rather it's more of you've got your thing and I've got my thing, and I want to support
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480]   you because I want you to be happy, but you've got your thing and I've got my thing.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.300]   And then the children, of course, all have their own things.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.860]   Very frequently in the modern US American family, the children's courses are set primarily
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.180]   by their school environment, and the parents have little input or influence over the curriculum
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.940]   that's chosen for their children, the values that are taught to their children, and the
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.700]   children just kind of come and go, taking their instruction primarily just from what
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.720]   they're taught in that particular system.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.580]   But they're not part of an overall family unit.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.540]   They don't really know what dad does.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.740]   They may go to the office here and there, but they don't really know what dad does.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.900]   They don't really know what mom does.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.180]   And usually the work that mom and dad are engaged in is not something that the children
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.140]   care about or are taught to care about.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.180]   They don't understand why it's meaningful.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.500]   If dad's a lawyer, well, you know, dad does legal stuff, but we don't really know much
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.980]   and he talks about it sometimes.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.820]   And I'm trying to give even in a positive case, let's say mom and dad get together and
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.380]   have dinner every night with the family, which is of course one of the most important things
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.900]   you could do for the stability of your children.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.580]   Let's say that does happen.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.460]   Very frequently the children aren't interested in or the parents aren't able to articulate
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.940]   things in a way that will engage the children.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.540]   And so the lives of the modern US American family, even a family that is together physically,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.540]   those lives tend to be disconnected and going in different directions.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.020]   And there's not much of a shared sense of purpose, a sense of family mission, a sense
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.780]   of family identity even.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.980]   Well, I oppose those things.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.820]   I think there should be a sense of shared purpose, mission, a sense of family identity.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.700]   And I don't fully know exactly how that's created.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.420]   I don't think you have to have a family business in order to create that sense of family mission,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.420]   but I think a family business might serve that goal.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.020]   I don't think you have to be physically together in order to build a sense of coherent identity
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.660]   as far as the values of a certain family, but I think that working together can help
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.260]   those values to be absorbed and assimilated by the younger generation.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.840]   And so for a long time I've wanted to be able to work from home so that my wife and I could
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.180]   build a more integrated family unit, a family that's going to mean something, that's going
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.700]   to do something throughout the course of history, not a bunch of individuals who happen to share
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.700]   a name.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.580]   And I've always seen being able to work from home as an important component of that.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.140]   And that's been a primary motivator for me.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.060]   Another part of my own personal vision as far as why I've always wanted to be able to
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.940]   work from home is just the simple coziness of being able to do intellectually stimulating
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.520]   work in a cozy environment.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.940]   Most of my personal experience in many office environments, I learned that those environments
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.100]   didn't have much of a sense of coziness.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.520]   I guess to use some of the modern vernacular, it's hard to create that sense of hygge in
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.620]   the modern office environment, whereas I've always seen that as home.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.220]   Now part of that would be simply due to the fact that I was born and raised in a very
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.880]   welcoming environment.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.340]   My home was always a place of joy, of peace, of serenity.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.040]   It was always a place of warmth and love.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.420]   And so because of that, I associate home with all of those things.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.860]   I know people who have a different background, people for whom their home experience did
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.280]   not relate to those positive attributes and virtues, they have a very different sense
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   of home.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.520]   I've always liked to be in the home and offices are often very sterile, very cold,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   very uninviting.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   And I like to be in a cozy place and be able to do interesting and meaningful work.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.840]   And I always thought that would be best done in a house, at home.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.640]   I've also been strongly drawn to some of the financial benefits and lifestyle benefits
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.000]   of working from home.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.800]   For example, obvious lowering of expenses by removing the cost of commuting.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.160]   That's always been meaningful to me.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   If you could remove the cost of commuting, remove the cost of second car ownership, et
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.600]   cetera, you can dramatically lower your personal expenses.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.880]   And that's assuming even that you don't take advantage of some of the various tax benefits
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.940]   of dedicating some portion of your home to your personal business.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:36.520]   But also some of the larger benefits from the geographic flexibility, the idea of geo-arbitrage,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   being able to live in the less expensive part of town that's still a beautiful place, but
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.760]   because it doesn't have easy access to the downtown business center, you can get there
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.760]   for a cheaper price and have a higher lifestyle for a cheaper price.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.600]   Or some of the geographic arbitrage that can be gained on a national or international basis.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   If you can live in Mississippi and earn at New York City wages, your lifestyle in Mississippi
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.800]   can be very, very enjoyable and you can also salt away quite a bit of money.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.880]   Similarly, if you can live in Thailand and earn at London wage rates, your lifestyle
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.320]   can be excellent and your future financial freedom can be enhanced by that geographic
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.040]   arbitrage.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.720]   When you bring in concepts such as being able to earn income outside of the jurisdiction
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.200]   of any particular government by building your life in such a way that you can move outside
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.840]   of the taxing authorities, etc., there are significant benefits to being able to do work
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.800]   that's not geographically restricted.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.120]   And some of, I guess frankly, the last reason is just that it's always been a better perceived
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   lifestyle.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.480]   I've always wanted my Monday mornings not to be painful.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.760]   And I remember so many times the idea when I was younger, we would, I guess I remember
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.200]   in college, I went to a Super Bowl Sunday party one time and it went late, the game
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.480]   went late and I'm on the East Coast, so of course that means that it's the latest of
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.280]   any of the time zones in the United States.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   And people party hard on Sunday afternoon and then they dread Monday morning.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.960]   Well, I've always thought, why don't you just move Monday morning back and if you're going
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.000]   to be up late on Sunday for something that's important to you, just move Monday morning
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.200]   back and instead of starting at eight, start at 11.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   And that just seems to me to deliver a better perceived lifestyle.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.640]   Those were some of the reasons why, since I was in my teens, I've wanted to work from
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   home.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:47.120]   Now, reality is that some of those things are truly excellent, truly nice, truly good.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.480]   And some of those visions matched up with reality.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.200]   But of course the opposite is also true.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.920]   As with much goal setting, I had a more utopian idea and I wasn't able to fairly appreciate
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.280]   some of the benefits of not working from home.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   Whereas today I look back and I recognize some of those benefits as being things that
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   I miss.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.920]   So let's start with the reality.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:18.800]   The reality of working from home is it is and can be very comfortable and very pleasurable.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.440]   You can build for yourself a very nice environment.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.420]   And although I've been in some beautifully decorated offices over the years by people
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:33.040]   who were able to generate a very warm atmosphere in their private office, that's nothing compared
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.600]   to what you can create within your own home.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:43.660]   You can create a beautiful study, a beautiful work environment that is exactly how you want
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.660]   it to be.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.120]   And that can be very, very comfortable.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.280]   And in a moment I'll talk about some solutions, but I love the solution of having an office
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.000]   that is on the same physical property as your house but is outside of the house.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.960]   And I think of some of those types of offices that I've been fortunate to be in, of wealthy
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.480]   people who have created their perfect office environment.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.240]   And they're just the kind of places where you love to be, where I really enjoy being.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   And it's easier to do and it's really nice and comfortable and pleasurable.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.120]   I really love the ability to integrate my work life with some of my other life events,
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.880]   especially life events in the world of my children.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:32.320]   By not having to commute into the city, I'm more available for those moments, those times,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.520]   those special afternoons, those special activities.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.080]   If it's a particularly beautiful day and my brain is not working, I've learned instead
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.800]   of just chaining myself to the desk to try to beat it out, I've learned just to say,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.920]   "I'm done," and to go.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.280]   A number of years ago I had an experience where I was just totally stuck.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.120]   I could not seem to create and I was so frustrated.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.900]   And I would go, this was after the course of a couple of days and I had nothing to give.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.760]   And finally I just threw up my hands and I said, "That's it."
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.960]   And I took my family to the beach and we went and hung out at the beach and played on the
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   beach and I came home from that experience.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.560]   And instantly several things were clear.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.080]   I sat down in front of a microphone, I cranked out a whole bunch of particularly useful work,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.000]   but it didn't come to me while I was sitting at my desk.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.960]   It came to me while I was playing with my children at the beach.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.120]   That's the kind of opportunity that very few people have when they work in an office, but
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.480]   you might more frequently be able to have when you work from home.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.320]   In addition, I have to say that the idea of geo-arbitrage is really cool.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.280]   It's really, really powerful.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.080]   I haven't fully appreciated it until I've been traveling.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.560]   I had not fully appreciated it until our travels the past few months.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.440]   But when you can earn an income independent of a geographic location, that's really, really
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.880]   powerful because it opens up the world to you, literally the world.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.080]   And from a planning perspective, I had never appreciated that as fully as I probably should
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.640]   have until the past couple of months.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.320]   I could live and work from anywhere and I'm so grateful.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.120]   I'm so blessed to be able to do that.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   And yet it is really, really neat when you can move and you can live in the place that
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   you want to live.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.720]   I've met so many people living in places that they never thought they would be able to.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   And a lot of it has been gained through being able to earn their income remotely.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.760]   If you go and look in some of the resort towns, we've passed through a number of resort towns.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.700]   If you talk to people, it used to be that those resort towns were populated primarily
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:58.640]   by some lower paid service workers and retirees who could afford to live there because they
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   had their wealth earned independently.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.400]   But now it seems more and more that you find increasing numbers of young professionals
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   who enjoy living in those resort towns and because they can earn their living at the
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.040]   end of an internet connection, they're able to live there while not yet being independently
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   wealthy.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.120]   That is really, really neat to be able to have that geo arbitrage.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's really cool.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:33.600]   And I think it sets the stage for all kinds of lifestyle choices that hitherto were unimaginable
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.520]   for the common person, the common person who didn't come from an inherited wealth base,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.640]   but rather had the responsibility of earning their wealth and saving it themselves.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.080]   That's really, really cool.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.640]   But working from home also comes with a number of difficulties that I hadn't previously accounted
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.500]   for in my own thinking.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.640]   The first, it can be very hard on the family.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   In the early days of Radical Personal Finance, my wife and I had, I can't remember, I think
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:11.360]   we had one child and he was pretty young, a few months old, I think, when I started
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   doing the show.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.000]   And one of the biggest challenges was transitioning from my leaving the house every day to my
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.800]   being home in the house every day.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.420]   And that transition was a significant lifestyle change.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:30.160]   Now I've been very fortunate that my wife is not the kind of person who spends all of
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.060]   her time interrupting me during my workday and wishing that I would spend time with her.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.860]   But it was hard for her to figure out, "What do I do now that Joshua's home?"
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.940]   Because of course, when I'm in the home, the family dynamic is different than when I'm
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.520]   not in the home.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.940]   And so when I'm in the home and coming and going from the kitchen to get a cup of coffee
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.620]   or a glass of water or a snack, then I'm there, but I'm not emotionally available in the same
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.280]   way that I am at other times.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:04.620]   And that took time, that took work, and that was a significant challenge to make that transition
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.620]   period.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.900]   But that was a relatively short-term challenge because once she got used to it and once I
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.540]   got used to it, it really worked out well enough.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:17.400]   There weren't any long-term issues with that particular challenge.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.620]   But there have been other things that are challenging.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.660]   For example, one of the most significant is that it's hard to get meaningful work done
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.340]   with young children around.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.900]   Now that's the phase of life that we're in and we embrace it fully, but I have to admit
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.180]   that it's hard to get meaningful work done with young children around.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.980]   The microphone here at Radical Personal Finance has been silent over the last few weeks, and
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.220]   there have been a number of reasons for that.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.420]   But one of the major reasons is just simply that I couldn't figure out how and where to
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.980]   get work done.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.900]   I didn't have an office space, I didn't have anything set up.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.300]   I have solved that problem, I think.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:59.260]   Today is my first day in my new mobile office space and I think it'll work out well.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.160]   And thus far, today's experience has been proving that I was right.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.220]   But that's hard, of course, in a small, perhaps couple hundred foot RV, but it's still not
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.100]   easy in a house.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.080]   For me, noise isolation is challenging.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.780]   One of the most difficult things of creating audio has been noise isolation, but even isolation
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.260]   in terms of movement.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.280]   We previously had lived in a place that had a separate bedroom that didn't have a pass-through,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.060]   but right before traveling, we'd spent the last couple of years living in a place where
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.240]   the access to the backyard was through my office.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.140]   And that was really exasperating.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.100]   I'd be in the middle of a train of thought, I'd be working on something, and then all
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.140]   of a sudden here would come a troop of children to go through the backyard.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.460]   And there was no other real choice.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.820]   It wasn't as though I could fairly say, "No, we can't go through the office right now,"
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.620]   but it would be so disruptive that it was just physically hard to be able to focus.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.540]   And so I found that it's very difficult with young children.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.380]   Don't kid yourself about it.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.300]   If you have young children and you want to work from home, don't kid yourself.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   It's tough.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.580]   It's really tough.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.740]   To figure out an environment where that will actually work.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.860]   They are very disruptive.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.340]   I'm so thankful for them.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.900]   They are incredibly disruptive.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.420]   Of course, also in the home, it's easy for you to get distracted.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.820]   It's easy to allow yourself to become distracted.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.380]   Now your distractions may be different than mine.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.620]   My Achilles heel is simply the internet.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.280]   There's so much that I can get distracted into and drawn into that it's easy for me
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.020]   to waste hours on things that really don't contribute to my own personal goals and my
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.780]   own personal lifestyle.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:50.540]   Some people have the distraction of television or of activities around their house that they
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.500]   would like to engage in.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.780]   But it's challenging if you don't have a place that you're used to doing work.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.940]   It's challenging to make that switch from personal mode to business mode because I don't
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.140]   want to be productive 24 hours a day.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.620]   I don't want to spend all of my time working and putting forth work, but I do want to be
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.500]   productive when I'm working.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.340]   There's something about having a commute of some kind, whether it's a walk across the
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.140]   property, down the street, a drive across town.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.500]   A commute can allow you that transitional space where you get your mind ready for work.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.220]   And then on the way home, you get your mind ready for home and you enter those two different
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.220]   things.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:34.340]   Frequently, what I have found is it's hard to transition from work mode to home mode.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.020]   I may be sitting at my desk working and then I recognize, "Ah, it's time for me to quit."
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.660]   And I'm in the middle of thinking about things that are so far away from my personal life
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.260]   or I'm concerned about something or I'm stressed about a major decision.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.900]   And then I come home and it's hard for me to put a smile on my face and say, "Hi, honey,
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.900]   I'm home."
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.820]   My wife and I have this little tradition that it's silly, but I do the way of transitioning
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.980]   to let her know that I'm here and available is I come out the door and I say, "Hi, honey,
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.020]   I'm home."
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.140]   And it helps me to transition.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.540]   But still, I wish for the time.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.740]   Sometimes I need about 10 or 15 minutes in the car to adjust and to transition.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.940]   Working from home is often very lonely, especially if you're not involved in a virtual team environment
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.020]   of some kind.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.260]   It can be just very lonely.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.540]   It can be very difficult to stay focused.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.780]   If you don't have someone to talk to about what you're doing, about what the next actions
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:38.420]   are, those meetings, it's of course easy to hate on those team meetings where you sit
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.680]   down around a conference table and try to figure out what's next.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.060]   But frankly, those are very helpful to help you figure out what to do.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.260]   And when it's just you at your desk, it's hard to figure out what to do.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.500]   Now, I think that can be mitigated to some extent if you're involved with a team, co-workers,
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.740]   employees, people who you're interacting with.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.320]   Then that aspect can be mitigated.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.900]   But it is a truth.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.900]   And often you miss out on just talking to adults and having those natural ad hoc conversations.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.540]   One of the biggest challenges experienced by, that is often joked about by stay-at-home
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:24.820]   moms is the desire for adult conversation.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.840]   When you spend all your day talking to little children, just having an adult conversation
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.020]   can feel like a breath of fresh air.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.780]   Well, I have certainly experienced that.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.620]   One of the things that I'm grateful for, having worked from home, I have a much deeper appreciation
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:44.260]   of what it's like to be a stay-at-home mom than I think many fathers do.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.180]   And if you're a father, I encourage you, perhaps it would be good for you to spend
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.460]   a few days at home to understand what happens in your wife's daily routine.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.580]   A lot of fathers who go off to the workplace often have very naive understandings of what
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.020]   happens in the home.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.420]   But that rabbit trail aside, it's the same experience that I've had working from home
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.000]   that often you just wish for a friendly conversation.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.340]   What happens is, at least for me, if I don't get a chance to talk to many people in person,
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.680]   I miss out on the normal human interaction.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.640]   And yet because of the availability of the internet, all I see is internet speech.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.420]   And I struggle to understand how much of internet speech is real.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.780]   I have friends who I've spoken with on this and they say, "Well, all internet speech
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.300]   is unreal."
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.980]   I don't quite buy that.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.480]   And by here I mean, I'm referring to the vicious commentary, the ugliness of speech,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.900]   the personal attacks that seem to flow so freely from one person to another.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.980]   I don't think that that's all unreal.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.480]   Those are real people who are typing those things out.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.300]   But I don't also think that it's all entirely real.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.620]   And for me, I so desperately need to get out into the world and to spend time with people
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:02.180]   who I'm not interacting with on the internet to regain a little bit of confidence in some
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.380]   sense of normalcy, of people's willingness and ability to interact with each other as
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.100]   humans, to have civil conversations with one another.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.340]   And that's been a real challenge for me personally, to identify the lines.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.600]   Where is the line between what's real and what's not?
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.780]   Interacting at the internet versus other things.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.540]   So that's one experience.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.140]   And so it's very easy when working from home to get lonely.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:35.100]   And I never appreciated how important those ad hoc conversations really were.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.740]   The ability to talk with somebody at work and just to bump into them, just bumping into
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:47.300]   people and enjoying those off-topic conversations, I have a greater appreciation for them now
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.740]   than ever before.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.800]   It can also be just simply very boring to be in the same place all the time.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.460]   If you are in your house, even if you love your house, if you're in your house and you
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.500]   live in your house and you work in your house, that can be really boring.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:09.420]   And if your personality is anything like mine, at least, you can crave a little bit of external
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.700]   stimulation.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:16.980]   And so you might find that you wind up underappreciating being at home and you might find that you
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:24.500]   wind up going out more to compensate for that sameness of routine, that sameness of place.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.620]   Now that might be a good thing.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.180]   You might further embrace the opportunities for adventure in your local town because you
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.820]   have more energy and more desire to go and embrace those.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.440]   It could also be a down, a not so good thing.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:42.500]   You might wind up spending more money than you otherwise thought you would.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.260]   But those are some real, real factors.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.980]   So in short, it's not all good and it's not all bad, just like with anything.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.380]   It's not a utopia.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.980]   There are certain problems that can be mitigated and can be solved.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.240]   But I think those problems and ideas that can be improved, whether you're in an office
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.340]   environment or in a home environment, I think they can be mitigated both ways.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.620]   I don't intend to go back to the corporate world.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.340]   Now if the circumstances of my life ended up leading me in that direction, I wouldn't
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340]   be opposed to it.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.900]   I'd actually appreciate certain things more than I appreciate them now.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:23.700]   Just like I've previously recorded shows on the value of being an employee.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.900]   When you are an employee, it's easy to look at the value of being a business owner and
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.740]   to say, "Well, everything would be better in the world of self-employment."
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.660]   And as a business owner, it's very easy to look back over at the world of employment
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.620]   and say, "Man, I wish I just were an employee.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:43.140]   I wish I just had some vacation days or somebody to call in sick to or stated tasks where I
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.100]   didn't have to figure out what to do and also do it.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.740]   I just went in and did what my boss told me to."
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.980]   I think it's the same with this particular environment.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.540]   But here's my best analysis at trying to solve some of the problems both ways.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.880]   First of all, in the office environment.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.940]   The major problems that I used to have with an office environment were the requirement
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:08.940]   to be in that office when I didn't need to be in that office.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:15.380]   I can remember being there and it's 4.42 and I've finished all my work and yet I know I
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:22.340]   can't leave till 5 and yet I've got to just keep on being there at my desk.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.660]   And you kind of get to the point where like, "What's the point of this?
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.940]   I want to go."
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:33.020]   Other examples would be days that you have people in town, friends of yours who visit,
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.140]   and you want to take the day off and show them around town, but you know you can't really
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.220]   do that because you've got to be at work.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.300]   Or it's a beautiful day and you want to go surfing or snow skiing and take advantage
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   of the weather, but you can't because you've got to be there in the office.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.980]   Well, I think that problem can be solved in a couple of ways.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.500]   First, that problem is largely solved by moving up the ranks.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.140]   If you are an entry-level, line-level employee, you're probably going to be required to be
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.820]   there at those certain times.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:05.940]   But if you are a management-level employee or an owner or partner-level employee, you
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.060]   can pretty much come and go as you like because you're held accountable for your results,
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.700]   not for your time.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.820]   And so you can solve that problem by moving up.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.540]   You can also solve it by choosing different kinds of work.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.220]   That's always been a high priority, and it continues to be a high priority for me.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.580]   I would very much not want to go into a job environment where I were required to be there
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.660]   from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.700]   So you can just think carefully about your job.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:39.980]   And instead of choosing a job of being a banker, you can choose a job of selling life insurance.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.780]   The financial skills associated with both of them, but one of them is going to require
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.360]   you to be at the teller window from 8 to 5 or whatever those banker hours are.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.140]   The other is going to give you that personal autonomy.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.960]   So you can make those choices and solve those problems in your own life if you're in an
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.420]   office environment by simply moving up or making a different career choice.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.300]   One other strategy is just appreciate that with the 8 to 5 comes the ability to leave
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.540]   at 5.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.140]   I don't think it's a good idea really unless you're really convinced and you can have your
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.460]   work pay off with your career by really putting in the hours.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.060]   I don't think if you're paid for an hourly job, I think you should leave at that time.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.760]   I had a family member who was a government school teacher.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.400]   One of the things I most appreciated about him was he left as soon as he didn't stick
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:39.280]   around and put in an extra 20 hours of work per week in the evenings being a government
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   school teacher.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.360]   He left at 3.30 or whatever the time was and he made sure that he got all the work needed
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.440]   to be done during that time.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.060]   There's no reason for you to spend more time at a job unless it's actually going to pay
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.520]   off in the long term.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.220]   But the great thing is when you leave that kind of job, you can leave it and there's
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.120]   no stress that follows you.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.400]   My wife was always very good about this.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.280]   She never gave her employers her cell phone numbers.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.920]   She never interacted with them.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.460]   This was in the era when it was common to do that, but she didn't put her work email
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.640]   on her phone.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.160]   She just always left.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.080]   I think that that would benefit many of us today to put those things in place.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.320]   Your employer might need a copy of your cell phone number for the emergency files, but
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.160]   you should never answer it.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.180]   Don't answer the text messages, don't answer the emails and keep that line drawn.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.800]   Unless it's going to pay off for you, just take advantage of that.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.880]   And then you can, instead of substituting that, instead of having that frustration about
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.200]   the fact that it's 4.42 and you can't leave, you can appreciate the fact that at 5.01 you're
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.840]   free of the job.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.320]   And so that can be helped.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.320]   Another major problem with the office is working with people that you don't like.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.360]   Just being exposed and being forced into a circumstance and a situation with people you
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   don't like.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.200]   I simply point out to you this, you're not forced to be there.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.940]   So leave and go find an office with people that you do like.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:10.280]   Other problems with the offices in terms of the commute, those can be solved with planning.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:16.920]   For example, you can live close to work and you might work downtown, but if you also live
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.600]   downtown then you can enjoy living that downtown lifestyle.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:29.040]   Or you can look into some transportation route into your town where instead of having to
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.180]   sit in traffic on the highway, you think about being on a bus route or on a bike route.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:41.360]   I am profoundly convinced of the value of buying a house or renting an apartment that's
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.960]   closer to work, even if it costs you more money.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.440]   I think that's a good lifestyle decision, a good expense to bear if you can make the
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   numbers work.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.120]   I'm also very much convinced of the value of choosing a neighborhood that is close to
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:01.200]   a transportation route, such as a bus route or a train route that would be convenient
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.040]   to get you to your office location.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.560]   And I think that if you're working in a job that you have this kind of choice over, you
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.000]   should choose your job based upon its location.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.080]   Very frequently people will choose a job in a location that doesn't fit some of those
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   things.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.720]   And I'm talking about the kinds of jobs where there are many versions of those.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.920]   I recently was interacting with somebody in a grocery store and I found out that they
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.680]   lived several towns over, but they commuted into this town.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.480]   And I thought, "Why do you commute into this town?
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.360]   You're working at a grocery store.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.160]   Just go and get this same kind of job, but instead of working at a grocery store, work
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.240]   at an auto parts store or something so you can avoid this commute."
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.000]   Because so much of your money is being sucked up in this commute.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.560]   So if you work at a job that's very fungible, where you can substitute one job for another
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.720]   one, then choose a job that is close to a bus stop or close to a train stop or has a
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.340]   beautiful bike path.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:03.640]   We passed through in our travels a town that has this beautiful bike path going from one
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.520]   end of town to the other.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.040]   And you could easily choose to live a couple miles outside of downtown, but by choosing
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.800]   a place that was near that bike path, you could bike in on this beautiful greenway into
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.960]   the downtown urban environment.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.720]   That's a really strong decision that I think really would pay off.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.760]   And you should be willing to pay more money to enhance that lifestyle.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.880]   And there are those benefits of being in an office that if you appreciate them and you
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.500]   plan around mitigating some of the things that you don't like and figure out how those
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.520]   can be mitigated for you personally, you can really improve your quality of life without
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.080]   working from home.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.460]   Now back to working from home, I think the most important thing about working from home
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.640]   is the optionality of it.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.920]   The fact, the thing I most appreciate about working from home is the fact that I can work
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.880]   from home or I can choose not to work from home.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.440]   Because then it gives me that sense of freedom.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.640]   But you don't have to have a home office to do that.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:09.760]   I think it's nice to have, if you're working in your home, it's really worth it to pursue
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:17.800]   establishing a separate facility for working, meaning a separate room, a separate suite
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   in the basement.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.040]   I think an ideal situation is to have a separate physical structure.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.160]   Now that helps me in terms of sound isolation with my unique type of work, but it'll help
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.720]   you with sound isolation as well, being able to make conference calls or business calls
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.280]   without hearing the dog barking in the background, et cetera.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.520]   And so if you can build a separate facility, a simple backyard shed will suffice that you
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.900]   go to, then you can have a place where work is done and where you go home.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.800]   One of the entrepreneurs that I interacted with that I just thought had just the most
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.240]   beautiful facility, he had about a five acre farm.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.760]   It's not a farm, a five acre property in a somewhat rural subdivision.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:09.320]   And he had the house, but he had converted the barn to this wonderful office and conference
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.560]   space.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.820]   And the walk down to the barn was not insignificant.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:19.720]   It was perhaps 100, 200 yards, 100, 200 yards.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.480]   It wasn't across the 30 foot backyard, it was a couple of hundred yards.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.680]   And yet that walk of a couple of hundred yards was ideal because it provided that transitional
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.520]   space where he was going to work.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.880]   And yet his facility in the formerly converted barn was beautiful.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.800]   It was so comfortable and cozy.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.400]   It was the kind of place that you really wanted to be.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.640]   And I think that's the best type of work from home environment to have.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.420]   It's really nice to have a separate facility for working.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.480]   That solves some of those family problems.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:58.440]   That solves some of the ability to get meaningful work done with young children around.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   And it also gives you some measure of flexibility while not removing those benefits of working
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   from home.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.700]   I think it's well worth considering the modern co-working movement.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.760]   In my travels, I've tried to visit a number of co-working spaces and facilities.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:22.100]   And those co-working spaces and facilities, I think, really do meet some of those needs
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.300]   of entrepreneurs or of independent workers where they have the ability to interact with
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.440]   people on that ad hoc basis, even though their work is independent.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:38.340]   And that gives them the ability to move and to travel, but you're not confined to one
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.800]   specific location, but it gives you those benefits of being in an office space where
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.460]   you have a separate space.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.420]   And that's why they're growing so much.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.900]   I expect that trend to continue.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.700]   And I think it's a very positive and healthy trend.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.460]   And I would like to support it in any way I can.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:00.180]   I think the factor of loneliness of working from home by yourself can be solved and should
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:07.740]   be solved by developing a team and/or by cultivating more meaningful social interaction outside
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.460]   of work.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:14.360]   My wife and I have talked a lot about this in terms of your social relationships.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:24.020]   What I realized is how much of our relationships are simply there because of factors we didn't
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.060]   intentionally choose.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:31.860]   What I mean is those relationships are frequently with co-workers just because that's who we
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.860]   know.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.800]   And we don't take the time or effort to cultivate relationships with those who we'd really like
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.360]   to spend time with, but we may not choose to work with.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.800]   So I try to look at that as an opportunity to embrace more social activity, but more
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.520]   intentional social activity.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.880]   Some of the boringness of being in the same place all the time, I think that also can
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:59.120]   be compensated by taking advantage of the fact that you are location independent.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:05.300]   Here, I think, again, working in a co-working space or renting an office is well worth considering,
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.360]   but do it in a way or place that solves your personal desires.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.920]   As I've traveled and stayed in RV parks and campgrounds, I've interacted with a lot of
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:22.060]   people who do live and work on the road full-time or part-time.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.520]   One of the most interesting people with whom I interacted was this man I met.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:32.320]   And he had this big, beautiful motorhome, big, probably 40-something foot, class A motorhome,
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   practically brand new.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.780]   It was about two years old.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.140]   He'd already put 50-something thousand miles on it, even though it was two years old and
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.440]   he bought it brand new.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:47.260]   And as I inquired of his situation, he works for a large company doing remote customer
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.720]   service work.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.420]   And so his job requires him to be on the phone and on the computer with customers during
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.620]   the entire normal 40-hour work week.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:03.980]   But what he has chosen to do is to spend about 50% of his time traveling during the year.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:11.860]   So he and his wife, his wife also works independently, he and his wife have a house in a big city
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.800]   and they spend a good amount of time there.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.700]   But then they also go on the road a lot.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.500]   Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn't.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.160]   But he works his normal 40-hour work week.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.780]   But then when he's done, he comes out his front door, he gets on the bicycle, and he
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.460]   loves to go and explore small towns.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.860]   And so his reason for doing it is every night, instead of going to the same pizza place around
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.740]   the corner, every night he explores a new restaurant in a new small town.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.140]   He goes to all the small town museums and he travels and seems to spend about a week
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.340]   in each place.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.660]   And he really likes that particular lifestyle.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:52.660]   And with their circumstance being middle-aged, a middle-aged couple, that class A motorhome
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.140]   was just a palace for them, frankly.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.340]   I chuckled at the fact that he doesn't even bother to put out one or two of his slides
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.660]   because he doesn't need the space and just feels too big inside.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.540]   That's how big and beautiful his motorhome was.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   So he was working in a traditional job that does allow that kind of disconnected location
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.920]   where he doesn't have to work in the central call center.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:25.900]   And he was embracing it to enjoy his particular desired travel lifestyle.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.780]   So that's my analysis for you, my overview of the good and the bad of working from home.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.420]   I hope that you can use it.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.140]   What I have found in the past, it's often hard to see the benefits of your own situation
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.180]   until those benefits are lost because of a life change.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.620]   And if you're working a job, it's often hard to see the benefits of that job until you
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.700]   leave and try something else.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:55.340]   And so I hope that if you've experienced frustration with your office job, I hope that these ideas
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.380]   will help you to appreciate a few things about your office job.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.440]   I believe that those frustrations can be mitigated.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.540]   And if you've experienced frustration with your home-based job, then I hope that these
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.060]   ideas will help you to mitigate some of that frustration.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:14.720]   Frankly, none of us have anything to complain about because we live in the most incredible
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:21.740]   time in human history where we can choose the work that we do more than any past generation
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.940]   has ever been able to do.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:28.780]   A few months ago, I taught the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career and Income Planning.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:36.380]   And as I went through and developed the curriculum for that course, one of the ideas that impacted
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:43.700]   me so deeply was how incredibly blessed we are to be able to choose these circumstances
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.700]   of our life.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.200]   That is fundamentally new.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.500]   Throughout human history, you did the work that your parents did or that your parents
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.620]   were able to apprentice you to somebody to learn.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.380]   You worked in the place where you grew up because you didn't know many of those options.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.700]   And if you did pursue something else, for example, if you decided you want to get on
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.660]   a ship and sail across the ocean or walk across a country and start a new life, that often
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.740]   came with the complete abandonment of everything with which you were familiar.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:20.500]   But in today's world, very frequently people get to try new things, new places, new lifestyles
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.460]   without entirely abandoning all of the old and comfortable and familiar.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.220]   The best example of this would be the embrace of modern air travel.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.460]   If you look at how many people are able to move across the country or move across the
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:39.680]   world and yet still travel home for the holidays, the fact that these options are available
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.140]   to a swollen middle class is really incredible.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:53.020]   What once was the luxury of the elite wealthy is now a commonplace experience of the middle
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   class.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.860]   And we should be grateful for those opportunities.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.960]   We should be grateful for the many choices that we have in our world.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:08.340]   And in any job, any occupation, any type of business, you can take that and you can either
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:14.980]   adjust the circumstances of that job to suit you a little bit more, or you can find a different
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:21.060]   expression of that job or business that will suit your personality and suit your own personal
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.220]   goals.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.540]   In closing, I would encourage you, take your own situation seriously.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.900]   Consider what's good, what's working, what's not.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.620]   You know, as I sit here in my new digs of my office that will travel with me on the
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.540]   road, I'm pleased with it.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.940]   One day working in it so far, pleased.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.620]   But it's because of just major problems.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.380]   And so embrace the problems because they can lead you to good solutions, but recognize
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.220]   that you can solve those problems.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.720]   If you need to buy something, buy something.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.500]   If you need to move, move.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.340]   If you need to change jobs, just change.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:06.060]   Have the courage to embrace what you think will make your circumstances better and try
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.060]   it.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.440]   And if it doesn't work, change.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   Try it.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   If it doesn't work, change.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.860]   I do encourage you, don't abandon if your visions or your ideas are like mine, where
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.260]   you want something more than a disconnected and fragmented lifestyle.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.220]   Don't abandon that desire.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.220]   Just look at how it can be accomplished in the best way possible.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:34.580]   When I was growing up, my father had a traditional engineering job, but he did also have the
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.980]   benefit of a small enough company where they were flexible with him in the early days when
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.220]   such flexibility was not entirely appreciated.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.540]   I still remember my dad coming home one time and showing us his new laptop computer.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.860]   It would have been sometime in the 90s.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.780]   And he was always on the leading edge of the tech world.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.260]   We had a computer in our home when few other families did because of the type of work that
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260]   he did.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.300]   But that gave him the benefits of being able to really have a major impact and do some
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.500]   pretty cool stuff with us as children.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.500]   There were many times when he worked from home for a season.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.460]   And there was one season where I particularly remember that he was able to negotiate his
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.340]   work environment in such a way that he did a huge amount of work in building our own
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.380]   house.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:23.360]   But he was able to do all of those things without abandoning a traditional office job.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.340]   So I'm convinced that it's possible in whatever circumstance you are to look for opportunities,
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.260]   to improve it, and to find it.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.740]   You don't always have to pursue a drastic change.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.740]   Hope these ideas have helped you with an honest analysis of the good and bad of working from
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.980]   home.
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.940]   One thing I forgot.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:51.260]   In closing, in my experience, the most important factor is having work that matters to you.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.020]   You have to have work that matters to you.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.220]   If you don't have work that matters to you and you try to work from home, I think you'll
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:04.940]   spend most of your time wasted, wasting it, because you won't want to do the work.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:09.420]   But if you have work that matters to you, then when working from home, you may be like
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.860]   me frustrated that you can't get more work done and appreciating the benefits of the
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860]   office.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.140]   Well, the same thing goes in reverse.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.100]   If you're working in an office and you don't have work that matters to you, you'll be frustrated
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   by the office environment.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:26.860]   And then if you have work that matters to you, you'll appreciate those certain things
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.260]   and you'll deal with the negative.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:35.300]   I almost forgot, because in conclusion, that point really, I think, is one of the most
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   important things.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   If you have work that matters, then that's what will attract your attention and your
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   focus.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.980]   And if you don't have work that matters to you, then you'll find whichever circumstance
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.340]   you're in to be difficult.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:55.700]   So if you're looking for a place to start, focus on finding and developing work that
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.100]   matters to you.
