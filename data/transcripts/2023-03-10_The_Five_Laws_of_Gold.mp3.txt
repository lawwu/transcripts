[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.480]   The Five Laws of Gold
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.200]   A bag heavy with gold or a clay tablet carved with words of wisdom. If thou hadst thy choice,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.480]   which wouldst thou choose?
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   By the flickering light from the fire of desert shrubs, the sun-tanned faces of the listeners
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.960]   gleamed with interest. "The gold, the gold!" chorused the Twenty-Seven.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.440]   Old Calabab smiled knowingly. "Hark!" he resumed, raising his hand. "Hear the wild
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.280]   dogs out there in the night. They howl and wail because they are lean with hunger. Yet
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.340]   feed them, and what do they do? Fight and strut, then fight and strut some more, giving
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.320]   no thought to the morrow that will surely come."
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.200]   Just so it is with the sons of men. Give them a choice of gold and wisdom, what do they
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   do? Ignore the wisdom and waste the gold. On the morrow they wail because they have
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.640]   no more gold. Gold is reserved for those who know its laws and abide by them.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   Calabab drew his white robe close about his lean legs, for a cool night wind was blowing.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.320]   "Because thou hast served me faithfully upon our long journey, because thou cared
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.620]   well for my camels, because thou toiled uncomplainingly across the hot sands of the desert, because
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.380]   thou fought bravely the robbers that sought to despoil my merchandise, I will tell thee
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:15.600]   this night the tale of the five laws of gold, such a tale as thou never hast heard before.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.040]   Mark ye with deep attention to the words I speak, for if you grasp their meaning and
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   heed them, in the days that come thou shalt have much gold."
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.860]   He paused impressively. Above, in a canopy of blue, the stars shone brightly in the crystal-clear
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.900]   skies of Babylonia. Behind the group loomed their faded tents, tightly staked against
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.600]   possible desert storms. Beside the tents were neatly stacked bales of merchandise covered
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   with skins. Nearby the camel herd sprawled in the sand, some chewing their cuds contentedly,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.920]   others snoring in hoarse discord. "Thou hast told us many good tales, Calabab,"
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.960]   spoke up the chief packer. "We look to thy wisdom to guide us upon the morrow, when our
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.200]   service with thee shall be at an end." "I have but told thee of my adventures in
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.440]   strange and distant lands. But this night I shall tell thee of the wisdom of Arkad,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.080]   the wise rich man." "Much have we heard of him," acknowledged
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.520]   the chief packer, "for he was the richest man that ever lived in Babylon."
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.560]   "The richest man he was, and that because he was wise in the ways of gold, even as no
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.160]   man had ever been before him. This night shall I tell you of his great wisdom, as it was
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.600]   told to me by Nomaseer, his son, many years ago in Nineveh, when I was but a lad. My master
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   and myself had tarried long into the night in the palace of Nomaseer. I had helped my
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.140]   master bring great bundles of fine rugs, each one to be tried by Nomaseer until his choice
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.520]   of colors was satisfied. At last he was well pleased, and commanded us to sit with him
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.680]   and to drink a rare vintage odorous to the nostrils and most warming to my stomach, which
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   was unaccustomed to such a drink. Then did he tell us this tale of the great wisdom of
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.440]   Arkad, his father, even as I shall tell it to you.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.460]   In Babylon it is the custom, as you know, that the sons of wealthy fathers live with
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.000]   their parents in expectation of inheriting the estate. Arkad did not approve of this
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.600]   custom. Therefore, when Nomaseer reached man's estate, he sent for the young man and addressed
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.680]   him. "My son, it is my desire that thou succeed to my estate. Thou must, however,
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.640]   first prove that thou art capable of wisely handling it. Therefore, I wish that thou go
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.980]   out into the world and show thy ability both to acquire gold and to make thyself respected
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.500]   among men. To start thee well, I will give thee two things of which I myself was denied
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.160]   when I started as a poor youth to build up a fortune. First, I give thee this bag of
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.240]   gold. If thou use it wisely, it will be the basis of thy future success. Second, I give
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:23.520]   thee this clay tablet upon which is carved the five laws of gold. If thou dost but interpret
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.800]   them in thy own acts, they shall bring thee competence and security. Ten years from this
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.720]   day, come thou back to the house of thy father and give account of thyself. If thou prove
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.160]   worthy, I will then make thee the heir to my estate. Otherwise, I will give it to the
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.080]   priests that they may barter for my soul the kind consideration of the gods."
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.000]   So Nomaseer went forth to make his own way, taking his bag of gold, the clay tablet carefully
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   wrapped in silken cloth, his slave, and the horses upon which they rode. The ten years
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.720]   passed and Nomaseer, as he had agreed, returned to the house of his father, who provided a
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.180]   great feast in his honor, to which he invited many friends and relatives. After the feast
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.820]   was over, the father and mother mounted their throne-like seats at one side of the great
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.560]   hall and Nomaseer stood before them to give an account of himself as he had promised his
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.280]   father. It was evening. The room was hazy with smokes from the wicks of the oil lamps
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.600]   that but dimly lighted it. Slaves in white woven jackets and tunics fanned the humid
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.100]   air rhythmically with long-stemmed palm leaves. A stately dignity colored the scene. The wife
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.600]   of Nomaseer and his two young sons, with friends and other members of the family, sat upon
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   rugs behind him, eager listeners. "My father," he began deferentially, "I bow before thy
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.680]   wisdom. Ten years ago, when I stood at the gates of manhood, thou bade me go forth and
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.040]   become a man among men, instead of remaining a vassal to thy fortune. Thou gave me liberally
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.800]   of thy gold. Thou gave me liberally of thy wisdom. Of the gold, alas, I must admit of
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.160]   a disastrous handling. It fled indeed from my inexperienced hands, even as a wild hare
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.800]   flees at the first opportunity from the youth who captures it." The father smiled indulgently.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.580]   "Continue, my son. Thy tale interests me in all its details. I decided to go to Nineveh
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.800]   as it was a growing city, believing that I might find there opportunities. I joined a
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.640]   caravan and among its members made numerous friends. Two well-spoken men, who had a most
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.420]   beautiful white horse as fleet as the wind, were among these. As we journeyed, they told
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.120]   me in confidence that in Nineveh was a wealthy man who owned a horse so swift that it had
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.440]   never been beaten. Its owner believed that no horse living could run with greater speed,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.200]   therefore would he wager any sum, however large, that his horse could outspeed any horse
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.740]   in all Babylonia. Compared to their horse, so my friends said, it was but a lumbering
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.800]   ass that could be beaten with ease. They offered as a great favor to permit me to join them
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.720]   in a wager. I was quite carried away with the plan. Our horse was badly beaten and I
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:34.400]   lost much of my gold. The father laughed. Later I discovered that this was a deceitful
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.040]   plan of these men and they constantly journeyed with caravans seeking victims. You see, the
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.800]   man in Nineveh was their partner and shared with them the bets he won. This shrewd deceit
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.640]   taught me my first lesson in looking out for myself.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.020]   I was soon to learn another equally bitter. In the caravan was another young man with
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:03.980]   whom I became quite friendly. He was the son of wealthy parents, like myself, journeying
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.860]   to Nineveh to find a suitable location. Not long after our arrival, he told me that a
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.360]   merchant had died and his shop with its rich merchandise and patronage could be secured
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.400]   at a paltry price. Saying that we would be equal partners, but first he must return to
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.960]   Babylon to secure his gold, he prevailed upon me to purchase the stock with my gold, agreeing
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.120]   that his would be used later to carry on our venture. He long delayed the trip to Babylon,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.520]   proving in the meantime to be an unwise buyer and a foolish spender. I finally put him out,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.440]   but not before the business had deteriorated to where we had only unsaleable goods and
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   no gold to buy other goods. I sacrificed what was left to an Israelite for a pitiful sum.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.160]   Soon there followed, I tell you, my father, bitter days. I sought employment and found
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.800]   it not, for I was without trade or training that would enable me to earn. I sold my horses.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.120]   I sold my slave. I sold my extra robes that I might have food and a place to sleep. But
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:17.560]   each day, grim want crouched closer. But in those bitter days, I remembered thy confidence
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   in me, my father. Thou had sent me forth to become a man, and this I was determined to
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:31.660]   accomplish. The mother buried her face and wept softly. At this time, I bethought me
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:38.000]   of the table thou had given to me upon which thou had carved the five laws of gold. Thereupon,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.280]   I read most carefully thy words of wisdom and realized that had I but sought wisdom
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.880]   first, my gold would not have been lost to me. I learned by heart each law and determined
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:55.020]   that when once more the goddess of good fortune smiled upon me, I would be guided by the wisdom
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.920]   of age and not by the inexperience of youth. For the benefit of you who are seated here
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.800]   this night, I will read the wisdom of my father as engraved upon the clay tablet which he
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.520]   gave to me ten years ago. The Five Laws of Gold
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:22.160]   1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity, to any man who will put by not less than one
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.760]   tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:36.880]   2. Gold laboureth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.040]   employment multiplying even as the flocks of the field.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.700]   3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.520]   of men wise in its handling. 4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.140]   it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:06.160]   by those skilled in its keep. 5. Gold flees the man who would force it
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.280]   to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:19.740]   or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.920]   These are the five laws of gold as written by my father. I do proclaim them as of greater
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.840]   value than gold itself, as I will show by the continuance of my tale.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.040]   He again faced his father. "I have told thee of the depth of poverty
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.460]   and despair to which my inexperience brought me. However, there is no chain of disasters
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:46.660]   that will not come to an end. Mine came when I secured employment managing a crew of slaves
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.360]   working upon the new outer wall of the city. Profiting from my knowledge of the first law
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.980]   of gold, I saved a copper from my first earnings, added to it at every opportunity until I had
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:04.280]   a piece of silver. It was a slow procedure, for one must live. I did spend grudgingly,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.680]   I admit, because I was determined to earn back before the ten years were over as much
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.640]   gold as you, my father, had given to me. One day the slave master, with whom I had become
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.440]   quite friendly, said to me, 'Thou art a thrifty youth who spends not wantonly what
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.400]   he earns. Hast thou gold put by that is not earning?' 'Yes,' I replied, 'it is my
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.360]   greatest desire to accumulate gold to replace that which my father gave to me and which
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.820]   I have lost. 'Tis a worthy ambition I will grant, and do you know that the gold which
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:42.020]   you have saved can work for you and earn much more gold? Alas, my experience has been bitter,
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.340]   for my father's gold has fled from me, and I am in much fear lest my own do the same.'
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.620]   'If thou hast confidence in me, I will give thee a lesson in the profitable handling of
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.780]   gold,' he replied. 'Within a year the outer wall will be complete and ready for
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.860]   the great gates of bronze that will be built at each entrance to protect the city from
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.260]   the king's enemies. In all Nineveh there is not enough metal to make these gates, and
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:11.420]   the king has not thought to provide it. Here is my plan. A group of us will pool our gold
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.100]   and send a caravan to the mines of copper and tin which are distant, and bring to Nineveh
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.620]   the metal for the gates. When the king says, "Make the great gates," we alone can supply
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:27.020]   the metal, and a rich price he will pay. If the king will not buy from us, we will yet
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.860]   have the metal which can be sold for a fair price.'
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.960]   In his offer I recognized an opportunity to abide by the third law and invest my savings
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:42.540]   under the guidance of wise men. Nor was I disappointed. Our pool was a success, and
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.380]   my small store of gold was greatly increased by the transaction. In due time I was accepted
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.580]   as a member of this same group in other ventures. They were men wise in the profitable handling
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.660]   of gold. They talked over each plan presented with great care before entering upon it. They
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.260]   would take no chance on losing their principal or tying it up in unprofitable investments
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.940]   from which their gold could not be recovered. Such foolish things as the horse race and
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.420]   the partnership into which I had entered with my inexperience would have had scant consideration
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.280]   with them. They would have immediately pointed out their weaknesses. Through my association
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.140]   with these men I learned to safely invest gold to bring profitable returns. As the years
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.020]   went on, my treasure increased more and more rapidly. I not only made back as much as I
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:34.140]   lost but much more. Through my misfortunes, my trials, and my success, I have tested time
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.820]   and again the wisdom of the five laws of gold, my father, and have proven them true in every
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.880]   test. To him who is without knowledge of the five laws, gold comes not often and goeth
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:52.060]   away quickly. But to him who abide by the five laws, gold comes and works as his dutiful
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:58.020]   slave." Nomaseer ceased speaking and motioned to a
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.980]   slave in the back of the room. The slave brought forward one at a time three heavy leather
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.560]   bags. One of these, Nomaseer took and placed upon the floor before his father, addressing
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:15.240]   him again, "Thou didst give to me a bag of gold, Babylon gold. Behold, in its place I
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.620]   do return to thee a bag of Nineveh gold of equal weight, an equal exchange as all will
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:28.100]   agree. Thou didst give to me a clay tablet inscribed with wisdom. Behold, in its stead
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:34.220]   I do return two bags of gold." So saying, he took from the slave the other two bags
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.340]   and likewise placed them upon the floor before his father. "This I do to prove to thee,
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:46.060]   my father, of how much greater value I consider thy wisdom than thy gold. Yet who can measure
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.720]   in bags of gold the value of wisdom? Without wisdom, gold is quickly lost by those who
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.980]   have it. But with wisdom, gold can be secured by those who have it not, as these three bags
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:04.460]   of gold do prove. It does indeed give to me the deepest satisfaction, my father, to stand
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:11.040]   before thee and say that because of thy wisdom I have been able to become rich and respected
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.180]   before men." The father placed his hand fondly upon the head of Nomaseer. "Thou hast learned
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:23.820]   well thy lessons and I am indeed fortunate to have a son to whom I may entrust my wealth."
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:30.340]   Calabab ceased his tale and looked critically at his listeners. "What means this to thee,
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.780]   this tale of Nomaseer?" he continued. "Who amongst thee can go to thy father or to the
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.620]   father of thy wife and give an account of wise handling of his earnings? What would
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.780]   these venerable men think were you to say, 'I have traveled much and learned much and
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:52.800]   labored much and earned much, yet alas, of gold I have little. Some I spent wisely, some
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.020]   I spent foolishly, and much I lost in unwise ways.' Dost still think it but an inconsistency
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:06.420]   of fate that some men have much gold and others have not? Then you err. Men have much gold
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.180]   when they know the five laws of gold and abide thereby."
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:17.060]   Because I learned these five laws in my youth and abided by them, I have become a wealthy
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.960]   merchant. Not by some strange magic did I accumulate my wealth. Wealth that comes quickly
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.020]   goeth the same way. Wealth that stayeth to give enjoyment and satisfaction to its owner
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:34.100]   comes gradually because it is a child born of knowledge and persistent purpose.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.020]   To earn wealth is but a slight burden upon the thoughtful man. Bearing the burden consistently
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.500]   from year to year accomplishes the final purpose. The five laws of gold offer to thee a rich
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:50.280]   reward for their observance. Each of these five laws is rich with meaning, and lest thou
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.620]   overlook this in the briefness of my tale, I will now repeat them. I do know them each
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.340]   by heart because in my youth I could see their value and would not be content until I knew
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.780]   them word for word.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   The First Law of Gold
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.860]   "Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.980]   tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. Any
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.940]   man who will put by one tenth of his earnings consistently and invest it wisely will surely
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.920]   create a valuable estate that will provide an income for him in the future and further
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.360]   guarantee safety for his family in case the gods call him to the world of darkness. This
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.100]   law always sayeth that gold cometh gladly to such a man. I can truly certify this in
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.580]   my own life. The more gold I accumulate the more readily it comes to me and in increased
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.500]   quantities. The gold which I save earns more, even as yours will, and its earnings earn
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.940]   more and this is the working out of the first law."
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.940]   The Second Law of Gold
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:01.340]   "Gold laboureth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:07.980]   employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. Gold indeed is a willing worker.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.060]   It is ever eager to multiply when opportunity presents itself. To every man who hath a store
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:18.460]   of gold set by, opportunity comes for its most profitable use. As the years pass it
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.020]   multiplies itself in surprising fashion."
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.100]   The Third Law of Gold
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:28.060]   "Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:35.140]   of men wise in its handling. Gold indeed clingeth to the cautious owner even as it flees the
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:40.900]   careless owner. The man who seeks the advice of men wise in handling gold soon learneth
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.360]   not to jeopardize his treasure, but to preserve in safety and to enjoy in contentment its
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.300]   consistent increase."
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   The Fourth Law of Gold
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:56.020]   "Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:01.860]   is not familiar, or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep. To the man who
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:07.940]   hath gold yet is not skilled in its handling, many uses for it appear most profitable. Too
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:13.740]   often these are fraught with danger of loss, and, if properly analyzed by wise men, show
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.900]   small possibility of profit. Therefore, the inexperienced owner of gold who trusts to
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.940]   his own judgment and invests it in business or purposes with which he is not familiar
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:32.460]   too often finds his judgment imperfect, and pays with his treasure for his inexperience.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.160]   Wise indeed is he who investeth his treasures under the advice of men skilled in the ways
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.340]   of gold."
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340]   The Fifth Law of Gold
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.260]   "Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings, or who followeth the
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.520]   alluring advice of tricksters and schemers, or who trusts it to his own inexperience and
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.940]   romantic desires in investment. Fanciful propositions that thrill like adventure tales always come
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:03.180]   to the new owner of gold. These appear to endow his treasure with magic powers that
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.780]   will enable it to make impossible earnings. Yet heed ye the wise men, for verily they
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.340]   know the risks that lurk behind every plan to make great wealth suddenly. Forget not
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.240]   the rich men of Nineveh who would take no chance of losing their principal or tying
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.380]   it up in unprofitable investments. This ends my tale of the Five Laws of Gold, in telling
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:30.640]   it to thee I have told the secrets of my own success. Yet they are not secrets, but truths
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.620]   which every man must first learn, and then follow who wishes to step out of the multitude
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.380]   that you, like yawn-wild dogs, must worry each day for food to eat."
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.800]   Tomorrow we enter Babylon. Look! See the fire that burns eternal above the Temple of Bel.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.460]   We are already in sight of the Golden City. Tomorrow each of thee shall have gold, the
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:00.000]   gold thou hast so well earned by thy faithful services. Ten years from this night what can
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.540]   you tell me about this gold? If there be men among you who, like no messiah, will use a
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.880]   portion of their gold to start for themselves an estate and be thenceforth wisely guided
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.240]   by the wisdom of Arkad, ten years from now, 'tis a safe wager like the son of Arkad
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:21.600]   they will be rich and respected among men. Our wise acts accompany us through life to
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:29.260]   please us and to help us, just as surely our unwise acts follow us to plague and torment
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:34.280]   us. Alas, they cannot be forgotten. In the front rank of the torments that do follow
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.000]   us are the memories of the things we should have done, of the opportunities which came
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.980]   to us and we took not. Rich are the treasures of Babylon, so rich no man can count their
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:51.060]   value in pieces of gold. Each year they grow richer and more valuable. Like the treasures
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.580]   of every land, they are a reward, a rich reward awaiting those men of purpose who determine
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:03.460]   to secure their just share. In the strength of thine own desires is a magic power. Guide
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:09.940]   this power with thy knowledge of the five laws of gold, and thou shalt share the treasures
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.180]   of Babylon.
