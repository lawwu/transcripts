[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Hey, everybody, welcome to Episode 98 of the all in podcast with us again. The Sultan of science,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.920]   the Queen of quinoa looks like he brought a trucker hat. What are you getting jealous of
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.080]   the Montclair hat? Or are you just not bathing? And I need a haircut. I haven't had a haircut
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.120]   like six weeks. I'm getting my haircut this afternoon. It's not gonna make a difference.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.560]   I think what freeberg is trying to tell us is that he is the Zodiac killer.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   All right, there is the unibar. All right. And Montclair sacks is here with his $400 Montclair
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.560]   hat. And of course, the dictator himself. I asked Ron, I asked Ron to cut my hair so that the white
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.560]   patch is more prominent. I think he did a good job. Do you add the white patch with coloring?
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.240]   Or is it? No, it's natural. It's just there. It's just there. No, it looks so odd. If you were
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.160]   doing it on purpose. It's super random. I like the way it looks. I like the way it looks. Jay
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.280]   Leno had to look like that. I'm about to go by the way, you know, this in the fall in truffle season,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.440]   I like to grow it so that it's more wavy white for white truffle season. Got it. I needed to
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.520]   have a reset cut. So then we could grow it wavy for the fall for truffle season. Listen,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   Samantha, the only thing less relevant to us than your cashmere sweaters is your haircut.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   All right, second announced the hiring freeze and reorg at Meta. He also said Meta will reduce
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.240]   headcount for the first time in its history. Meta's headcount in 2023 will be smaller than
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.840]   it was this year, he called at the end of an era of rapid growth. This on top of Apple reporting
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   and Apple got walloped in the market for the first time in forever. Apple pullback iPhone
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   production for the 14 after slower than anticipated demand. As I mentioned on previous episodes,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   they've kind of done a gentleman's layoff. Similar to, I think meta in that Apple said you have to
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.640]   be back in the office three days a week, a bunch of people quit. So you don't have to pay them,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.240]   I guess huge packages when they quit that way. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also called out employees
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.120]   in July, as you guys all read. And he wrote, there are real concerns that our productivity
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.000]   as a whole is not where it needs to be for the headcount. We have Google, of course,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   174,000 employees. So I guess the question I have for you is, are these the last hours to fall
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.240]   to moth in this pullback that we've seen, these are companies that don't need to do the layoffs,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   they have tons of cash. So they're obviously doing that to maintain earnings, one would,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.600]   and to maybe send a signal to employees that they need to work harder, what's your read on
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   these this past week's shoes to drop? Well, it definitely is the end of an era,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   I think it is sort of like the, the end of this phase of big tech, where you had this,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.120]   you know, unfettered growth, where these business models were largely unassailable, and they,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.520]   you know, were really just fighting to grow into their valuation and just generate more revenue
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   to justify where they where they traded at. And now it's this next phase where they have to operate
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.960]   more like a cash cow business. And so you know, it's an acknowledgement that the growth is tapering.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.640]   It's an acknowledgement that they're going to trade on a pretty tight band in terms of multiple,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.520]   which means that they have to manage expenses much more tightly, which means that they can't have
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   a really broad based surface area in which to operate an experiment, you have to keep the
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.960]   experiments small, you have to manage your expenses, you can't have employees, basically,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.520]   you know, run over the place management has to have a firm hand in dictating strategy and what
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.560]   people work on. So I think all of that signals that I actually Jason, I don't think this is the
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   end, I actually think it's the beginning, because these companies, Apple, Facebook, Google, maybe a
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.560]   little bit Microsoft are the most sensitive to valuation, because they are the most widely held,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.600]   right, these are the these are the, you know, the equivalent of US treasuries in the equity markets,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.440]   the safest, most predictable, safe haven in times of stress, if you want to own big,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   chunky cash flow generating businesses that you know, are relatively unassailable,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.040]   you couldn't pick for better businesses than those. And so the fact that they see enough in
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.000]   the horizon to say that we need to batten down the hatches should be a warning to everybody else.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.600]   Freeberg, is it as simple as this that the they're moving from top line growth to bottom line,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.440]   and they're going to need to look at the expenses? What's your read on this for Silicon Valley?
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.920]   Well, I just want to zoom out for a second, because I remember I started working in Silicon
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.360]   Valley in 2001. You guys are a little older than me, I think, but like we were right at the kind
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.560]   of year one of the dot com implosion, and all the fallout that happened from all the funding that
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.960]   happened from 97 to 99 to 2000. And so from 01 to 03, it was super like deflationary. Everyone was
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.840]   cutting costs, and all the money that had been raised was kind of being pissed away, or companies
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   were liquidating, and you know, so on. And then starting in 2004, which is actually when I joined
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.920]   Google, but there was also this big movement starting 03, 04 of like what people called web
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.520]   two, then kind of new business models and new businesses started to emerge that seemed to have
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.720]   real traction and real legs. And it was a different story, and a much more rational story than what
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   you saw leading up to kind of 2000 2001. And it was around that time when Google started offering
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.160]   these crazy benefits, right? It was like, there's a gym and free food and all these amazing workplace.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.800]   And suddenly, everyone had to do that to keep up, right? Facebook obviously mimicked it,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.080]   all the other big companies mimicked it, and then it became mainstay. And they also raised
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.000]   compensation in the valley significantly, because Google had really cracked the nut
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.440]   on how to extract value from the internet. And it really changed everything in Silicon Valley
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.920]   and changed everything in tech, because suddenly every tech company, whether you are enterprise
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.680]   software or hardware, or an internet e commerce site, to be competitive and hire great talent,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.760]   you have to have the same sort of environment, high wages, great salaries, really share the value
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.520]   with your employees, you know, gyms and free food and all this sort of stuff. So it's the first time
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.600]   I think, in a generation since like 2003 2004, that we're seeing things start to turn the other
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   way, where instead of adding more benefits, you know, making things more attractive, giving more
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.960]   value to employees, we're really seeing the recession hit these kind of leading indicators
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.360]   of how things are going to be in the valley. And as a result, I think we should expect to see
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   a similar impact on compensation, on benefits, on value share, and on kind of proclivity to hire an
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.160]   opportunity to kind of jump jobs and you know, opportunities that we've all kind of taken for
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   granted over the past 18 years. And this is going to be a real shock to a lot of people that work
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.080]   in tech. And a lot of people that have gotten used to the idea that every company offers great
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.040]   benefits, there's always another job to jump to, it'll pay you more. And that that as that engine
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.240]   of growth that was really driven by these big companies by Google, Facebook, Apple starts to
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.920]   slow. No one needs to compete with them anymore as much and the compensation bands get tighter,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.480]   and the option value gets tighter and the free stuff gets tighter. So it's the end of an era.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.080]   And I think it's a new world for tech and Silicon Valley.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.800]   sex, what are your thoughts here in terms of startups in relation to big tech,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.600]   maybe having these austerity measures kick in and refocusing on profitability?
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.920]   The big takeaway here is just that nobody is safe. And it's not just startups have to,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.480]   you know, tighten their belts, it's these big companies too. And I think we're headed for
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.400]   a broad based recession. That's what it seems like you saw Druckenmiller's comments this week,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.640]   predicting a hard landing in 2023. No one's talking about soft landing anymore. In fact,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.120]   I think we're all wondering who's flying the plane. So I think we're headed for a pretty
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.360]   big recession. And I just take it in a slightly different direction. I'm down here in LA,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.560]   had dinner the other night with a friend who's a showrunner in Hollywood. And so a showrunner
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.240]   basically is like the head writer, and they basically put together the writing team and
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.360]   the content for a show, and then they sell them to networks. He said that like,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   no one is buying anything anymore here that last year, you had there was tremendous,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.640]   you know, activity. And you saw like the Game of Thrones guys, you know, D&D, they got like a
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.360]   $300 million deal from Netflix and Shonda Rhimes.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.120]   These are like the platform deals they did.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.600]   Yeah, they got like, there were massive multi hundred million dollar deals being made last year.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.200]   And that was just for like future writing deals, like Netflix wasn't even buying libraries when
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.240]   they did those deals.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.080]   They were locking down talent for the next day.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.760]   Exactly. So all of that has stopped. And the reason is that Netflix's stock has been hammered,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.160]   right? And only so they not have the capital to do those kinds of crazy deals anymore. But they
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.240]   know that Wall Street is watching them. And so fundamentally, they're questioning whether
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.520]   their business model even works if they have to spend that much money on content.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.920]   So then all of Netflix's competitors basically have stopped. So this whole like frothy environment
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.280]   that you had for in Hollywood last year, that's just over the faucets been turned off. And it's
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   not even turned off to a trickle, it's just stopped. So you think that this like massive
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.080]   asset bubble that we had last year, was just in crypto and gross stocks. It's not I think
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.640]   it actually trickled down into the real economy, because Netflix was one of those gross stocks,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.080]   the money then flowed into writers in Hollywood, and then lots of other places.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.680]   This is one small example, right, that that this asset bubble wasn't purely just something that's
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   going to be localized to crypto, it affects real people in the real economy. And we are just
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.160]   beginning to see the unwind of that. Yeah, what's absolutely correct,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.920]   I think is people were more risk taking, they had free capital, they wanted to place more bets.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.120]   And sure, why wouldn't you bet on the game of throne writers for the next decade, but
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.520]   looking at this is going to be fantastic for startups. I mean, the startups I've worked with
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.160]   over the last five years have been, they always come to me, oh, I got a developer, but this person's
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.760]   got three offers from, you know, Facebook, Google. And they're like, how do I land this person,
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.400]   they got $300,000 a year offering a million dollars in RSUs. And basically, founders had to
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   say, No, I can't get that person. And so they had to get creative. And they would hire people,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.920]   Ukraine, Uruguay, everywhere in between, to try to find developer talent, and they had to get
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.480]   creative. Now, all of those people are not going to have four job offers are going to have no job
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   offers, they may have gotten laid off. And those crazy, unrealistic out of school deals are going
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.760]   to be gone. And this means massive consolidation of talent. You look at the startups community
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.160]   right now, tons of companies are just going out of business, they're packing it in those people
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.240]   are going to go work at the other startups that are stronger. So whoever makes it out of this as
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.520]   a startup, this is how the cycle restarts, is talent then consolidates on the winners, it'd be
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.960]   like taking the NBA and getting rid of the bottom, you know, 10 teams and just telling the best
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.120]   players there, move up to the other teams, and everybody else, you're out of the league. So I
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.520]   think this is incredible setup for 2023 for startups to consolidate talent. So I'm actually
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.280]   excited. Yes, it's another data point that, again, I said it last week, I'll go out on a limb and
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:48.000]   predict my equivalent November fall predictions. Last fall, it was at the markets, we're going to
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.240]   poop the bed. My prediction now is that I think the markets are bottoming and consolidating. Yep.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.080]   100%. And this is the time, I think, to start nibbling and start getting ready to really rip
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.920]   the money in. And I think there's enough signals every day that kind of like, tell me at least that
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.840]   on the margin. It's time because I think the markets do a reasonably good job of digesting
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.120]   news, and then pricing the forward reality, right? Like today's price is really everything
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   we already know. And so the real guess is what's about to happen in the future. And from my
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.440]   perspective, I'm actually pretty starting to get a little constructive here. I think that when
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.560]   companies like Facebook really do this, and, you know, like, if you think about it one way,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.360]   the financial markets have always had this thing that we have called a Fed put, what does that
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.560]   mean to put is essentially the right to sell something. And what market participants have
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:44.400]   always known for the last decade, is that if things got very hairy, if there was uncertainty
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.040]   in the market, the Federal Reserve would and they have consistently stepped in to create a buyer of
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:58.320]   last resort. And so it always eliminated that last part of true, you know, supply demand balance,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.600]   because they would just come and say, Don't worry, in many ways in tech, what the big tech
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.840]   companies were, were that, you know, you could never really find what the true market clearing
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.680]   price for an engineer was, or what the true amount of expenses you should spend on office space,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.040]   or, you know, free services, because you always always had these companies, which was an escalating
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.360]   arms race, you know, if one company had a massage, the next company had gyms and massage and physical
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   therapists, and the other company would have buses to take you to the gyms and massage,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   and therapists and the next company would have protein shakes that were freshly made,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.200]   you know, and it just kept escalating and escalating, because the costs didn't matter.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.480]   And they wanted if nothing else, to get that marginal engineer, or product manager,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   or business person to work at their company, which eliminated the risk that they would actually start
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.280]   something to disrupt them. Blocker strategies very real, you should have a blocker strategies
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:03.440]   is very real. So when you take this big tech put out of the market, you will get true price
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   discovery. And you will find out what the real price should be. For this kind of an engineer,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.840]   that kind of a product manager, you'll find out what are the real expenses you need to bear in
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.480]   order to build a real lasting business. And you'll be able to sort through all of that stuff out. So
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.080]   I think it's a really good moment. And again, it's yet another indication to me that I think broadly
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:31.680]   speaking, the markets are now starting to stabilize all the irrational behavior is starting
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   to exit the system, the parties in the last few hours, volumes going down, the alcohol is being
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.040]   taken away, people are hanging around with a little bit of lights are coming on, they're like,
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.640]   I've been here a little too long. And I think that that's a very healthy process for an economy.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.160]   And I think that that's what's happening right now. So I'm constructive, I'm a little bullish,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.760]   I'll go I'll go out on a limb, I think, you know, we could be three to 5% from the lows,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.400]   but we're more near the lows than the highs. It certainly feels like the double bottoming
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.360]   out process was the bouncing along the bottom. And yeah, who knows how hard the landing is. But
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.760]   I think it's a great setup for startups and people who want to start companies. I don't know if you
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.360]   saw girly did a great interview that trended on the Twitter. And he's just saying this is the
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.680]   best time to start a company. And I have to agree with him like you're going to have talent available.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.040]   And who are you competing against for buying ads, like there's so many marketing opportunities
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.840]   available. The first thing to go in a down market like this is advertising and marketing. So
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:35.040]   and by the way, we will we will also relive what we have empirically known to be true. And it's
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.120]   been it's been pretty well proven. The investments that one makes in this period will probably be
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   the best for many, many years to come, because they'll have the most asymmetric upside. And that
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:54.560]   was true in 2008, nine and 10. It was true in you know, 2002, three and four. You I mean, you're
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:00.400]   talking incredible companies just in those two periods. Think about this Atlassian, Tesla, Uber,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.080]   Google, Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, WhatsApp, incredible businesses that have created tremendous
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.040]   value. And so there are businesses that have been invested in for the first time in 2022,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:19.760]   and will be invested in for the first time in 2023. And 24, which will be the leading winners
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.360]   of this next phase and this next leg up. And so the real opportunity is to find out who those
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.600]   companies are and get behind them, I think 100% as I always tell people, fortunes are made in the
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.560]   down market, they're collected in the up market. freeberg, what are your thoughts here in terms of
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.120]   the startup community or company builder, and talent, because that seems to be the piece that
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.760]   could be a silver lining on all of this maelstrom that we're going through?
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.040]   I mean, technology always marches forward. So there's always, you know, there's always
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   progress to be to be had and to be made. That's one universal truth about it's weird that we call
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.800]   it an industry, because a lot of technology companies in Silicon Valley today, don't sell
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.360]   technology to other companies, which is how Silicon Valley started. Nowadays, Silicon Valley
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.240]   is reinventing other industries by being technology led. And that is certainly still
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.200]   true, because there are so many, I hate using the term, but undisrupted industries
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:28.080]   to pursue efficiency gains across and technology built in Silicon Valley can can can drive that
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.840]   now, when I say Silicon Valley, I don't mean the physical location anymore. And that's the
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.160]   confounding factor here, which is that there does seem to be this distribution opportunity
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.000]   that's also emerged at the same time, where people are doing remote work and work from home,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.760]   and distributed workforce models that seem to be highly effective. You guys talked about it last
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   year, and I don't think they ever had an office, right? I mean, don't most of the people work from
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:59.520]   home there. And I think that the success that's been seen in software companies that have operated
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   that model also changes the calculus because not only are our wages lower, and therefore,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   the cost of operating is lower, not needing a fancy expensive office in San Francisco is needed.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.440]   But you can also access far more talent than you ever could before. You don't just need people to
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.160]   live in the Bay Area or New York or LA or wherever you're operating from. So from a software
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.320]   perspective, this is an amazing time. I'll tell you, there's a flip side to this, like in life
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.600]   sciences, real estate is more expensive than it's ever been right now in the Bay Area. To get lab
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.840]   space, there's a total dearth of space. So there's certain segments that I think are
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.240]   why is that large lab space like a specific, specific designation, you know, I mean,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.800]   there's a revolution in genomics, that's totally transforming all of biology and human health. And
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.840]   what I'm saying is, like, do you need a certain type of location that's sanctioned for that? Yeah,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.800]   yeah, lab space is a certain kind of build out. And it's not, you know, and so there's a certain
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.360]   amount of square footage, and it's being built out a lot around the Bay Area. But the thing about life
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.080]   sciences companies is you do have to operate physically, because you're doing some you're
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:11.680]   building something physical. And so that is an industry that continues to remain very well funded
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.280]   and very competitive. And I think, you know, there's still tremendous value. And by the way,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.360]   there's a lot of public companies to invest in, not on the primary basis, but that are tools
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.520]   companies that are benefiting greatly from the continued demand and growth in spending in that
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.600]   category. sex, let's talk about competition, you know, a lot of talk, you know, of these large
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   companies pursuing many different verticals, we talked about anti competitive stuff, Lena Khan,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:45.040]   the bundling in the suite of products at Microsoft, other firms. Now you have all these being cut,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:53.360]   death, death to the room. Death to the room. By the way, did you see that Elizabeth Warren,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.680]   of all the things she could send a letter to the FTC about I guess she sent a letter about the room
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.600]   but I mean, Senator Karen is just too much man. I mean, there's a lot of other stuff going on,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.440]   but you can let the room but slide. That's not important. Oh, you know, all the things that are
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.720]   going on right now in 2022. It's the room but that gets on the gets that's above the line.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:22.640]   At this point, I mean, my point is sleepwalking. Oh my gosh, walking. What is going on? There's a
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.800]   famous history of World War One called the sleepwalkers because that's basically what
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.400]   it felt like is they just slept walk their way to World War One. Basically, what should have been a
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.360]   minor regional war, the Third Balkans war that nobody should have cared about. Nobody should
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:44.240]   have cared about this Franz Ferdinand guy, except for you know, the Austrian. Yeah, exactly. But
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.960]   the whole world basically got themselves invested in this thing. And it feels and this is what we're
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.920]   worried about. We're worried about the room but when the administration is sleepwalking its way
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   into the next World War. Well, I do not want Amazon okay to control my vacuum cleaner. I'm
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.720]   just gonna put that on the record. Okay? Because what happens if they know where the dirt is,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   they know which rooms are dirty. What happens if they get ahold of room, but I'll tell you what
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.640]   happens. The next thing is they're going to go after Dyson. Okay. And then once they do that,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.160]   they're going to put chips in these things. And all of a sudden, they're going to know exactly
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.640]   what Jason said. What are you eating where your dust bunnies are? Yeah, all of this stuff. It's
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.160]   this must be stopped Lena. Now. No, but to the point of competition, you're seeing cuts to,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.400]   you know, all the non core projects at these big companies. This is going to be great for startups,
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.640]   right? Like the idea that Facebook could focus on, you know, a fourth, fifth, sixth thing is going
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.680]   to go away. Yeah. Well, look, you're right that great companies are built during downturns.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.240]   PayPal was built largely during the downturn. The startup I created Yammer was built largely
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.560]   during a downturn. So listen, there's going to be opportunities. Innovation doesn't stop just
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.040]   because we're in a recession or depression. But I gotta tell you, I, unlike Chamath, I'm having a
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:03.200]   hard time finding a silver lining right now. Part of it is the comments that Druckenmiller just made,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.040]   which and he's been right about this stuff. We've been talking about his predictions for over a year
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.600]   on this podcast, and he famously shorted the pound for George Soros. That was when he was first
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.040]   getting started. But yeah, since then, he's one of the most successful macro traders in the world
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:25.440]   and, you know, universally respected, and I think deservedly so. Remember, he said that this was in
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.960]   mid 2021, he said that the Fed was engaged in a radical monetary policy, because even though we
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.760]   were starting to get inflation, it was around 5% then, that they were still engaged in this bond
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.160]   buying program. They're still bought like 160 billion of bonds. And he's the first one waving
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   the alarm bell saying, what are they doing? And now his predictions have come true. I mean, we're
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.120]   in a inflationary spiral. And his prediction now is his central outlook is that the Dow Jones will
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.840]   be in the same place where it is today in 10 years. And he made the point that yes, equity markets do
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.400]   go up in the long term, but how long term you're talking about from night from roughly 1966 to
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.600]   1982, the stock market was sideways, Japan had a lost decade as well. Like this is not unprecedented
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.920]   after an asset bubble, right? And then from the Great Depression, it took until 1955 for the stock
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.960]   market to recover. So in the long run, the stock market will go up, but it could be you know, we
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.080]   could have a flat decade, or this is his prediction, right? But he's very smart guy. And, and then on
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   top of that, that's not to say that you can't be one of the ones who make money during that period,
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.800]   because lots of people do. But we're in for I think, a very tough economic period because of
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:44.320]   just this radical, expansionary fiscal monetary policy we've had, basically the Fed, and the
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.760]   administration printed the last two administrations, but especially this one, printed $10 trillion
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.520]   over the last couple of years, and the handover on that sex, most of that was under Trump, but
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.400]   continue. No, it's not 100% was I'll pull it up in a second. But anyway, keep going.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:06.320]   We had Biden basically kept digging this hole, we had the $2 trillion of American rescue plan,
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.800]   which we didn't need, we just had another 2 trillion of the infrastructure bill, the inflation
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   Reduction Act,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.040]   500 billion for student debt.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.200]   Yeah, exactly. So Jason, what are you talking about? And this was all after the emergency was
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.360]   over. But I think I think that you guys are debating the wrong thing. I think that what
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.960]   Druckenmiller I think, by the way, just to be clear, both Druckenmiller and I can be right,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.480]   which is he's commenting on the real world economy going into a recession. What I'm saying is that
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.800]   the stock market tends to be nine to 12 months ahead of where we are, Nick, throw up that chart,
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.480]   please, that I asked you guys to share, just to give you guys a sense of what I mean by this,
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.520]   by the way, while you're doing that, Jamal, Jason, look, I will agree with you that a lot
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.200]   of this point, I'm just pulling up, he did 7.8 trillion, more than Biden, but fine.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.320]   A lot of the stimulus happened under Trump. You're right, because that's when basically COVID
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.080]   happened. Remember, in that Q2 of 2020 quarter, the economy shrank at a 30% annualized rate,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.280]   everyone thought we're going into a Great Depression. And that's why they passed all
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.920]   the stimulus by huge bipartisan margins. Druckenmiller's best point is that this
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.400]   is all post vaccine, right? Yeah. Yeah. So look, and I think we can definitely go back
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.680]   and second guess what happened during the Trump administration. There's an old saying that
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.360]   many of the worst ideas are bipartisan. And so, you know, the spending that happened in 2020 was
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.440]   clearly bipartisan, and maybe it went way too far. But in the last two years, like Druck said,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.080]   it was post vaccine, post emergency, and they kept spending and it's not just the administration,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.480]   it was the bond buying program of the Fed, where the economy was already fully back,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.440]   and they bought another 160 billion of bonds. Yeah, I think I think the thing is that, you know,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:52.720]   I think Stan is a proven Republican. So maybe he is speaking a little bit of his book as well. I
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.480]   think it's fair to say that both Trump and Biden did not help. But overwhelmingly, I think where
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.840]   the where the problem stands is a central bank that was the same through both of those administrations.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.800]   And I think we should probably focus on them because you're right, what they did was excessive.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.200]   And what they essentially said, is that if there is volatility beyond a certain amount,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:22.240]   and people cry uncle, we will not allow the markets to sort themselves out in an orderly way,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.720]   we will step in. And that's what you know, again, what we just talked about the central bank put,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.920]   in this case, the Fed interventions, and these interventions really pervert a market because
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   you don't know what's going on. And that has huge ramifications in the real economy. So,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.800]   Nick, if you just throw up this chart, the the thing that is really important here, and what
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.440]   this chart shows is essentially all of the hiking cycles that we've gone through since 1983. So 83
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:55.760]   878 94 99, or 415 in the current one. And here's what I just want to call out for you guys. What's
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   incredible is that other than the one in 83, so this is sort of like, you know, that last big one.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:11.600]   What we've seen is that the stock market has a tendency to immediately go to the conclusion,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.480]   very early on in a rate hiking cycle. And now why is that important for normal folks listening to
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.440]   this thing? Well, the reason why that's important is right now we're in month seven of a cycle,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:29.920]   we obviously don't know how long it's going to be. But the odds are improving every day,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.920]   that we're near the end versus the beginning. And why that's important is, again, if you're
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.560]   thinking about when to, you know, buy equities, for example, this is a really instructive guide,
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:48.480]   because what it tells you is the closer we get to the end. Or more importantly, the closer we
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.080]   psychologically know that the end is coming, we start buying and that and that's just a broad
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.280]   base statement that has been true. So you know, what you see right now, I think is really interesting,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:05.680]   which is that despite all the bad information, oh my gosh, the Nord Stream pipeline blew up
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.440]   couldn't have been sabotage. Was it the CIA? Was it the Russians? Oh my gosh, big tech is slowing
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.960]   spending and firing people. China's in a coup. I don't know if you saw that rumor. Yeah. How
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.480]   about something more benign? You know, the the US, you know, us yuan is really trading in a crazy way.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.200]   The US euro is trading in a crazy way. The US pound is going crazy. Despite all of that. Every
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.760]   time we trade down, the market consolidates very quickly. And we sort of like so I think we're
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.000]   forming a bottom. I do think that Stan is right, we are going to see a hard landing recession,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.160]   something will break in 2023. I hope it doesn't. I hope it doesn't affect a lot of normal people.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.560]   But it's likely but at the same time, define hard landing. So I'll tell you in a second. But at the
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   same time, I think what's happening is in the equity and financial markets. We are consolidating
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.080]   a bottom because we're seeing through to that end state. And this is where cheap equity gets
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.800]   bought. So why is there a reason to sell now? I think a lot of the people that are selling the
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:16.480]   smart money sellers that I talked to are essentially right now selling to book in capital losses,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.920]   to offset other capital gains from this year, a term that's called tax loss harvesting. And so
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   if you have gains through this year, which some of us do, this is the great moment to just sell
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:32.640]   the losers to book the loss to net it out so that you can minimize your taxes for next year. That's
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.160]   probably I think where we are at. And I think that's why they're still consolidated by. So what
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.000]   is the hard landing Jason, if I had to predict, I think what David said is absolutely right,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.440]   you're going to see unemployment, get to an awkward and uncomfortable number. 56% I think
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.480]   could be something that we see. And I think you're going to see a lot more companies pull way back on
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.760]   their spend. Because demand is going to really modulate. Oh, you know, I'll give you a crazy
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:07.360]   example. You know, what happens to all the people in the United States that are on arm mortgages,
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.440]   right adjustable rate mortgages, when those things reset, they're going to reset to 300
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.760]   basis points higher, their monthly payments are going are going to go nuclear already happened
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.360]   to my I literally had a family member call me about this. And they were like, What do I do?
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:32.480]   So in the UK, yeah, in the UK, 40% of all mortgage dollars are interest only arms that will reset in
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:41.280]   January to around 4% 40%. Can you imagine how upside down the UK economy is going to be when
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.760]   people have to spend three and four times more to keep their home and then people have to go to work.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.360]   So people who have not been participating are going to have those bills come in and they're
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.040]   going to have to go to work, they're gonna have to go to work. Yeah. So free bird, what do you
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.880]   what do you think? hard landing here? And then what do you think 2023 looks like in that regard?
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.400]   It's looking pretty bleak.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.920]   Do you buy that we're bottoming out now as Chamath is sort of hypothesizing?
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.120]   I mean, I'll tell you. I was running some back of the envelope math.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.320]   You know how much debt there is in the world? Take a guess.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:23.120]   200. A couple 100 trillion. 200 trillion.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:33.280]   About 300 trillion. Yeah. That's debt owed by governments, businesses, and households. And if
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:40.400]   in response to the inflation, which is response to fiscal stimulus, which is a response to the
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.960]   entire economy of the world shutting down for a couple of months.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:55.040]   We end up raising rates from zero to 5%. That's a $15 trillion of annual debt service,
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:03.520]   which is like 18% of global GDP. Like that the debt service alone.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.320]   But what does that mean?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.200]   percent? That means that for every dollar transacted?
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.600]   means nothing. No, I mean, what does it mean? Like, so what?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.720]   So I'm saying that there's a massive squeeze hat that's going to happen, right? And so what ends
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.400]   up happening ultimately is because you could run this across local governments.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.720]   I think it means demand destruction. I mean, sovereign debt, households. Yeah.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.080]   Think No, no, I'll tell you. I'll tell you about what it means. I'm sorry. But it means nothing.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.640]   And I'll tell you why these people keep you can print more money, you print more money. I'm sorry
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:46.160]   to be the bearer of bad news. But like, it is not as if we have a law, a constitutional law,
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.360]   or it's not as if governments have collectively decided that you cannot have debt to GDP
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.440]   above a certain number. That doesn't happen, guys. We passed 100 under Obama, and we've just
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.000]   kept printing money. So whether we like it or not, and I'm not saying I'm a fan of this, or it's
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.760]   right, we are kicking the can down the road. And what we're doing is we're extending the maturities.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.960]   You know, you'll eventually have 100 year government bonds, okay? Just like you have,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.760]   like now, you know, multi decade long corporate bonds, we missed a chance for that. We missed it.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.640]   Because brilliant Yellen actually said no to that, when when rates were like near zero,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.200]   and we had the opportunity to refinance the US government debt, what using long term rates,
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.120]   basically long term bonds. And actually, it was Trump who, you know, crazy Trump, who suggested,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.480]   let's basically shift the debt to 100 year bonds. And she said no.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   She thought it was the value of a dollar, right?
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.800]   So the problem is that we have all this short term debt. And look at what just happened in the UK,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.600]   when Liz Trust tried to prop up the bond rates by basically intervening, she was basically an
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.880]   inflationary policy to fight inflation. The markets puked all over that. And that's when they're the
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   pound hit, you know,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.960]   exactly. There's, there's only so you have to have a buyer of the debt, right?
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.760]   I think the list trusting is really actually a microcosm of how, unfortunately, Western
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.000]   governments are working. But I think there's a silver lining, like, she basically came in a day
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   after she got elected and said, Okay, guess what, guys, at the same time, I'm going to massively cut
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   taxes, and I'm going to give you fiscal stimulus, I'm going to cap your energy bills. And I'm going
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:27.360]   to have these huge transfer payments from the government into the hands of British citizens.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.000]   I'm not going to comment on whether that's right or right, right or wrong.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.640]   But the financial markets to your point, David, absolutely hated it. And within a few days,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.560]   you basically saw the pound get crushed. But then what did you see? You saw the Bank of England
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.160]   decide that financial stability was more important than financial viability, meaning the things that
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.440]   she wanted to do were not viable. So you could have let the financial markets sort this out,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.640]   which would have forced the Prime Minister to basically abandon the policy. But instead,
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.320]   the BOE said, Now, we're an unlimited buyer of UK guilt, which is the name of the UK bond.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.960]   And everything snapped back, we're back to where we were before her speech and before
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.760]   the Chancellor of the exchequer speech. And so it's as if nothing happened. And that's what's
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.680]   so insane to me, which is that even though the Bank of England, by the way, in the next week
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.440]   or two are going to raise rates 140 basis points, 140 basis points, almost double what the Fed has
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.560]   done the last three times. They're doing both at the same time, they're both raising rates,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:34.080]   and they're acting as a backstop for bad policy. And this is what's wrong right now in the world,
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:40.400]   we do not have a real check and balance. So my point to freeberg is just that I'm like emotionally
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:46.240]   on your side. But the problem is, with these folks keep getting bailed out, David, they're
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   just going to keep doing this stuff. And there's no end in sight. Well, the the consumer doesn't
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.760]   get bailed out. So that if you look at it on a micro basis, instead of a macro basis, you're
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.040]   correct, these governments will just bail people out, even if they make bad decisions, as we're
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:04.080]   seeing. But then the person who's variable interest mortgage just kicked in has $500 less a month in
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.520]   savings. So they're now not going to buy an iPhone 14, they're not going to upgrade their car every
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.600]   six years, they're going to do it every eight years. So the demand destruction that's happening
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   is going to be quite severe. And that's going to reduce money, that's going to
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.480]   end monetary velocity. And then we restart mark my words, the Federal Reserve will intervene.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.080]   This is why I think we're in a bottoming process. I think the the bleeding edge of the smart
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:34.880]   financial actors are actually on Saksa side and freeberg side. But then they're taking that next
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.200]   intellectual leap and saying, Okay, well, what happens when Apple basically says, Hey, guys,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.920]   I'm gonna have to fire 15% of my employees. I think what happens is the Fed intervenes.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.720]   And I'm just using Apple as an example. But there is a threshold of demand destruction, Jason,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.120]   I think you're right, where we have the Fed put come back on the table, and the markets just go
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.480]   bonkers. So instead of doing 75 basis points, two or three times, they're just gonna be like,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.840]   you know, 50. We'll slow it down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're gonna,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   they're gonna get to four and a half very quickly. And then this something's gonna break,
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.480]   like all these guys are saying, I think they're right. And then the Fed put comes back on the
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:14.320]   table. And we'll have this, we'll have the UK, you know, the UK thing happened in what six days,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:19.760]   ours will play out over six or nine months. But it's going to play out the exact same way.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.120]   And freebergs, right, you know, we should have capped debt at, you know, 100% of GDP or less.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.880]   And Saksa is right, we should have issued 100 year bonds and zero rates when we had the chance.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.720]   We didn't do either those things. So incompetent sex, I mean,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:38.000]   there was no need to have rates this low for that long. And maybe they could just keep them
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.640]   at some average number, instead of going down to zero, or that spiking back up and just
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:47.840]   steering, you know, spinning the steering wheel, you know, so violently, why don't we have some
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.760]   basic concept of maybe not having zero rates and keeping them at 2% or something reasonable. So
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.040]   you have some dry powder? Well, if you go back and listen to what the Fed said, and drug makes this
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.640]   point, they were all worried that they got there was an inflation print a few years ago, where I
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:10.080]   was at 1.7%. And they all started panicking about not being at 2%. So for a point 3% move that they
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.560]   tried to engineer, they opened the floodgates. Okay, and that's basically what happened. And
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.320]   that's why he's so critical of it. The other thing is the Fed, remember, the Fed said,
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   we're going to be data driven. But then the data came in last summer, we got that surprise 5.1%
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.880]   print, and they dismissed it as transitory. So they said they're going to be data driven,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:36.080]   but they weren't they they were dismissive. Now, on what basis? Did they conclude transitory? Like,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.400]   what was the proof for that? There was no proof. That was a political consideration. The
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.840]   administration and me and Yellen is big part of that immediately reacted to basically downplay
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.400]   the news. I mean, they PR did I mean, they didn't want to admit there was a problem.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.920]   They went from transitory to this is permanent to now six months, but during and now we're at
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   hard landing. Like, right, these people are not competent. Are they just not competent?
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.840]   No, I think they're really I think they are competent. But I think that they're a little
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.760]   bit fighting with one hand tied behind their back. I think if you had to take the other side, Saks,
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.200]   you know, the problem is they have a very specific strain of data that they focus on.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:19.840]   And that data has all these weird anomalies to it. Like, you know, they should look at rent data.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:26.000]   But the way that the rent data works is that, you know, you bleed it in one sixth a month over six
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.680]   months, just as an odd example, or like use car data only comes in a certain way. So I think
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.800]   they're driving in the rearview mirror. I think there is something to that. I think it's simpler
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   than this, which is listen, I think all politicians do this, which is when they get bad news, they
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.000]   want to spin it. And they're going to delay acknowledging the bad news as long as possible.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.760]   So what happened last summer, when this inflation started, they all dismissed it,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.840]   it was all a talking point. I mean, every single one of them. And here's the crazy thing is Jay
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:58.160]   Powell, he's the only Trump official who got reappointed by Biden by a huge majority. How
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.440]   do you think that happened? And when did it happen? It happened at the end of May last summer. So just
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.720]   when this inflation print came out, and Yellen and the administration were saying it was transitory,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:14.400]   that's when Powell was up for renomination. And he swept through the only Trump appointment
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.200]   to basically be re nominated without even a question by Biden. Why? Because he got on board
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.880]   the talking points. He wasn't gonna basically buck them at that time. So he waited six months,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.240]   he bought into the talking points. That was 100% political. I told you I read Paul,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.720]   it's a very compelling argument. I read the fair. It's really compelling. It's really
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.360]   compelling. It's sad, but compelling. Sacha should read the Paul Volcker book keeping at it.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.400]   He basically says Reagan came to him off site where they knew they wouldn't be recorded and
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.080]   told them do not raise rates. So this idea that the Fed is independent, like history now has shown
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.480]   us it is not like the there is massive political pressure on them. I think especially at the time
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.040]   driving in the review mirror, clearly, the data they have is not great. And then all this data
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.320]   is nuanced. You know, jobs and this massive amount of jobs we've had in this country is because of
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.840]   you, we have a new immigration policy, we don't let people into this country, we kick out PhDs
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.240]   that we trained. And then housing, we have i buyers buying this. So to your point, Jamal,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.800]   I think a lot of the data has changed. And they're, they've got a bad data set,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.480]   they have a bad dashboard, and they're driving with bad information. They don't know their
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.320]   direction. They don't know their speed perfectly. You went more fidelity on the data.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.440]   You're right. If you went to a board of directors meeting for your company and said,
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.960]   how's the business doing? And the CEO says, Well, you know, well, we're going to have data from six
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.720]   months ago. And it's like, Okay, I got that. But what about like last week, and you would fire that
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.640]   CEO to your point, Jason. And these things are knowable today, like there are businesses,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.160]   for example, that are selling billions of dollars worth of like IoT sensors here and there energy
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.960]   sensors here, everything is connected to the internet, everything is automated, everything
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:02.240]   is running in code, you would think that the government would say there's a national level
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.360]   directive here to get this into some kind of a system that we can use, because these decisions
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.160]   are becoming more and more important. I think that would be a wonderful idea and a project
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.880]   and what had huge value. A Manhattan project for understanding the economy on a very granular level,
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.480]   we you invested in a startup at one point, I remember I heard the pitch, where they had people
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.800]   around the world, taking pictures of food prices, Africa, India, the United States anywhere,
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.320]   and then putting them into a database normalizing them. So you could know the price of tomatoes or
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.880]   potatoes on a global basis, you know, and normalizing all that data, they don't seem to
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.760]   have this data there. They're talking about August data. And it's, you know, we're now in October,
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.120]   it's a really odd situation. I think, you know, our friend,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:52.960]   backers are made this point, which was that, look, in this last FOMC meeting, the Fed raised their
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:59.600]   forecast for what the neutral interest rate would be from three and a half to 4.6%. So in two months,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.680]   they raised their forecast by over 100 basis points. What is that based on? Like, is there a
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.000]   model? I assume there is a model, I assume there's data. So why don't they just open source that?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.120]   Why don't they let the markets, like see the model they're using. So we have a little more
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.760]   predictability. Of course, they always have the discretion to bucket or not follow it or whatever,
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:23.440]   change it. But like, you know, wouldn't that be a better approach is to like, let us see the data
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.480]   and the models in real time as it's happening. And then the community, like like an open source
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.280]   project could actually, like fork the model and actually create like better ones.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.320]   Well, to your point, to your point, like there's the the Fed is actually known as the gold standard
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.000]   of transparency. So the IMF has kind of like a view and how all these central banks act last week,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.920]   they actually excoriated and this is this hurts me to say Canada, because of their lack of
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.640]   transparency. Apparently, Canada doesn't even put out minutes. And so they were like, Hey, Canada,
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:01.760]   you, you guys like, yeah, you know, look, Canadians are I mean, the Canadian government,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.920]   at least like total moral virtue signalers, but they don't value transparency, apparently.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:13.040]   But to your point, David, there is a lot of opacity in these things that really determine
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.000]   how the real world works and the impacts to individual people are going to go and get
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.040]   ratcheted way up. And nobody really knows what to expect, even though the data is there,
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.000]   sitting in plain sight. I think two things can be true. I think
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:36.400]   the Fed, the process of setting central bank rates by the Federal Reserve
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.000]   should be reset. I also think that it could be true that the Fed is not responsible
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.280]   fully for a lot of the conditions we're now facing. We did have a bunch of policy decisions
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.320]   that the whole world got swept up in, and seem to accept as appropriate at the time,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:02.560]   when we shut the global economy down. And there was some weird assumption or belief
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:09.360]   that fiscal policy would allow us to soft land or recover out of that. And at the end of the day,
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:16.320]   all that fiscal policy did, and I remember I was speaking with a smart person at the time,
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.480]   and he said, all the Fed's going to do is they're just going to inflate everything. And it's going
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.840]   to take a while and everything will inflate. And that way, everyone will feel good for a while.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.640]   But you can't just stop the spigot of capital moving goods moving and services moving
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.120]   for months on end, and assume that the repercussions will not actually be felt extremely
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.920]   harshly. And at some point, things are going to come home to roost. And that is what's happening.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:45.280]   There was no winning solution for the Fed, or for any central banker. In light of the policy
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.400]   decisions that were made to shut the global economy down, when COVID began, not to argue
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.040]   whether or not that was appropriate, but that was simply a statement of fact. I said it before.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.880]   And I don't understand if you were to take a first principles point of view on this
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.400]   today and say, hey, let's create a central bank and how should it operate? You would take all
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.760]   the data from Intuit, from PayPal, from Visa, from MasterCard, from the internet,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:13.040]   you would take all of that data, you would let the algorithms or the AI or the software
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.520]   figure out what is most predictive of certain inflationary recessionary,
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.040]   totally, and growth indicators. Totally. And you would basically say, look,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:29.280]   x percent growth, x percent inflation, solve for what the central bank's interest rate should be.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.360]   And it should vary at 100th of a percent or a basis point every day. And every day,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.400]   the rate is reset and the software resets it. And to have, you know, some degree of human logic or
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.440]   oversight seems appropriate. But to have a decision made in quarter percent increments,
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.120]   once every couple of weeks, seems seems kind of arcane. So I think both things are true.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:55.440]   The Fed isn't necessarily fully responsible. We all want to point fingers. You know, we can point
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:02.320]   fingers at the the mania that swept over the entire world. When we started our podcast,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.400]   and everyone was like, what the hell is going on? Why are we locking down the world? And this is
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.640]   nuts. And it felt nuts. And the response may or may not have been appropriate. But at the end of
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:16.000]   the day, there was a cost and the cost is going to be born for very likely a decade or more if we
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.280]   are able to get through it all. A lost decade is a possibility. And central banks would be rewritten.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.040]   So yeah, well, I think there's actually two original sins of the economic crisis we're in.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:30.720]   One is lockdowns. You're right. Like that was a fiasco. It didn't do anything to stop COVID.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.440]   It was an economic disaster. And then we overreacted to lockdowns by then printing
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.840]   all of this money, both fiscally and through expansionist monetary policy.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.200]   So Freeberg's right about that. But I think the other original sin here
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:50.640]   is the QE and the ZERP, right? The zero interest rate policy that began in 2008, 2009. We broke
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.160]   the glass in case of emergency. And then it just became standard. Like it was on autopilot.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.280]   Why did we keep printing? Why did the government keep buying?
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.600]   It was a long tail event that became the meme.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.480]   This is the problem is that every time government...
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.320]   ZERP is a bad idea. I mean, it's just...
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.080]   Yeah, Milton Friedman once said, there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   program. How many times have we seen this? Every time the government's supposed to do something on
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.720]   a one-off emergency basis, like ZERP, it ends up becoming institutionalized. We still have
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.840]   kids in schools in California wearing masks. I mean, it's the same crazy thing that people
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.760]   cannot get off these programs. The thing about ZERP, which if you look back,
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.280]   what really happened if you think about like how people live their lives every day, what has
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.600]   happened in our view of government and politicians? It's really eroded since 2007, 2008, right?
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.040]   There's huge amounts of rancor. Nobody gets along. Everything tends to happen on partisan lines.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.960]   And the reason I think that that was allowed to happen or that accelerated is actually because
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.880]   of ZERP. Because if you think about it, if you had failed policy, right, and the economy was
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.840]   completely broken, politicians would actually have to get together and try to solve the problem
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.960]   themselves. And the last time they really did that was actually in the great financial crisis.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.080]   If you look at TARP, and if you look at how all of these smart people actually had to get together
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.440]   in a bipartisan way to figure out how do we bail out America and prevent a banking crisis,
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.720]   that was the last real effort that touched a lot of people. But then, David, as you said,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.160]   on the heels of that, we broke the glass and we've been fighting ever since. And the peak of that
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:33.200]   fighting was basically Donald Trump getting elected. And so I think like what it shows is
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   that if you have these irrational central bankers, that will are that are willing to constantly bail
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:44.480]   people out, you will never get a high functioning government because policy is irrelevant. Good
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:51.040]   policy doesn't matter. I think policy doesn't matter if any of it goes wrong. The central banker
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:56.800]   will come in and bail us out. Well, and the second and third order impact of these is can become
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.200]   quite acute. And just for people who heard the word ZERP, like three times zero interest rate
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.400]   policy, basically keeping interest rates very low, very dangerous to do, because you get shit like
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:12.240]   this, like look at the number of unemployed people per job opening. And if you just look at this,
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:18.000]   like ratio, this is the number of jobs per unemployed person, it gets way out of whack.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.840]   And then if you look at this other chart, just in terms of the total number of job openings,
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.560]   you know, we started we talked about this earlier in the pod, hitting 11 million to burn that off
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.840]   is crazy. Then what happens if you have too many jobs, you don't let immigration you don't have a
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:38.720]   functioning immigration policy? Well, then you get this great, you know, people quitting their jobs,
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:46.400]   quiet quitting, and then the boomers saw their net worth go up so high because of their retirement
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.880]   accounts because of the stock market boom. And because of the housing boom, you had all these
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.200]   rich parents now who are bailing out their kids who refuse to go to work and labor participation
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:01.440]   goes from 70% down to 62%. These are the unintended consequences of Zerp. That, you know, now,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.720]   how do you get a generation to go back to work? If their parents have, you know, a $2 million home,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.880]   and 3 million in stocks or a million dollar home, you have to break the economy. Yeah,
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.960]   and that's what they're doing. Like, we're gonna break this, we're gonna we're gonna get Google
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:21.120]   and Apple who have unlimited cash to do a riff. Those companies don't need to do a riff. They're
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:27.120]   doing it because they have no choice now. Because they want to break the economy so hard. boomers
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.920]   have 71 trillion in assets over March. I mean, the wealth transfer that's going to occur between
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.280]   these two generations is crazy. Why would any us a millennial with a boomer parent even go to work
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.320]   if they've got a million US boomers have $71 trillion in assets is how he said, Yeah, that's
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:48.000]   the number I have here. So an entire turn of global GDP in savings, that's about one seventh
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.160]   of the world's total assets. It's just a lot of locked up. Well. And this monetary policy was done
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:02.560]   by boomers 70 trillion, controlled by 76.4 million people. Yeah. So if you want to really talk about
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:09.760]   the, you know, the rich, in a global context, the rich are very specifically us boomers. Yeah,
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:16.000]   that's one seventh of the world's one seventh of the world's assets is controlled by 76 million
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.440]   people. How much of it is their homes? I mean, they were they were at Woodstock, they you know,
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.720]   they live the best life in the best times they enjoyed the most of the peace dividend in the
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:34.960]   80s and the 90s. In the 2000s. They are the ones that control everything. It's pretty crazy.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:44.320]   It's I think it's less like Jeff Bezos and Gates and Musk, it's boomers. That if you want to go
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:50.160]   and really zoom out and get it right, it is boomers. It's 1% of the global population that
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.840]   controls one seventh of the global wealth. And they're all in the US boomers, hiding in plain
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:01.120]   sight, us boomers. There you are. Well, once these housing prices decline in the stock market
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.040]   declines, that number is going to shift. And that really is what's fundamentally happening with the
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.560]   fiscal policy and the effects it's happening today. It's having today, which is a redistribution of
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:15.280]   that value, because we're basically deflating all those assets. Now we're deflate, we're gonna
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.520]   deflate the average boomer assets, and we're going to deflate real estate assets. I mean,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.880]   if you if you just do the math on that back of the envelope, these boomers are worth a billion
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.720]   $1 million each. Like, think about that. Like every boomer is worth 900k a million something
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:36.800]   in that range 1.2 million. I mean, it's bonkers. That's the average. That's how much wealth they
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:44.720]   have. bonkers. You you two are a boomer, Jacob. No, we're jacks. We're Gen X. We had the worst we
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.960]   had the we had like we got really shafted. It's like we you know, we grew up with flannel. We
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:55.280]   we have a little Jan Linus Morrisette Alanis Morrisette. Hold on. Hold on. Smashing pumpkins.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:02.240]   93 was probably the best year. smashing pumpkins ever did it for me. Billy Corgan's voice was
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.120]   always like, yeah, really annoying rage against the machine. Can we do a quick shout out for
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:14.000]   coolio sad to hear that he passed. We're here for you. Yeah, I mean, it was really sad. The guy was
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.840]   how old was he? 50? Were you a big fan of coolios? I love coolio. His coolio story from the pod when
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:28.240]   he said, gangsters paradise. I feel you. Yeah. And then when I saw him at saxes birthday last year,
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.920]   I was like, dude, I love coolio. I mean, I cannot tell you what a big fan I am. What was the line
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.560]   you said to him? You said I feel you. I said I appreciate you and appreciate you. I appreciate
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:46.000]   you. We fly down for the birthday. They you know, they shuttle you on the cars from the plane to the
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.640]   to the house. We get to the house. And you know, we're all waiting. Of course, sax is late two and
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.200]   a half hours to his own party. We're all hanging out starving. But then we go into the party.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:00.560]   And then they have like coolio shows up. So we're like sitting down to dinner for course two.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:06.800]   All of a sudden pop comes out of the woodwork coolio I lose my shit. I run up on the
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.560]   the dance floor. I grew up coolio like it's like high school jams, man. I mean, that's like
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.760]   in the car cruising. And at this point, I'm like seven tequila watermelon tequilas in so I'm like,
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:29.120]   oh my god. I think I thought I was sacked, you know, because he's like, yeah, he's like,
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.760]   oh, two South African Jews. You guys all look the same. Coolio comes up starts high fiving me and
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.640]   hugging me. And I'm like, what's up coolio? My god, this is like a dream come true. He's like
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.680]   hugging me his face is right next to my face. I didn't know what to say. And I like I'm I've had
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.920]   a little bit of tequila and I and I whisper in coolio's ear. I'm like, oh no, I appreciate I
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   appreciate you. I didn't know what to say. I think I saw Freeberg throw his panties on stage too.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:10.000]   You are such a nerd. I don't know what to say. I mean, what do you say?
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:17.440]   Clearly, you don't know what to say. Yeah, my team, my team and TPB, they had a they had a cameo
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.560]   made for me that coolio sent in. It was super heartfelt and awesome. Saks posted it on the
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:28.000]   internet, I think. Yeah, I retweeted it. Yeah, retweeted it. And it was I don't know, man,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.720]   it was he was he was actually a super nice guy. Great guy. And it was super sad.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:40.800]   Yo, Dave. So friendly neighborhood coolio, bro. I'm out here on the golf course thinking about you.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:48.800]   I appreciate you, man. So I want to wish you a very, very, very happy birthday, man. You feel me?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.560]   I want you to drink good. I want you to smoke good. I want you to eat good. I want you to have
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:57:03.200]   some fun, bro. Go big. Do it right. Yo, Dave, happy birthday, man from coolio. Shaka zoom, man.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:08.800]   Well, all the stories are coming out now. And not your experience was not unique. He
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:14.400]   touched everybody he met. Literally, he's college kids were like genuine, very kind, like,
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:19.200]   yeah, it was a real super friendly and like, you know, and and like, wanted to ask about you. I
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.800]   mean, it's like a very like, I could have been a politician if he didn't become a music, music
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:32.720]   superstar. And I guess he looked incredible. He looked like he was 25. I mean, he literally went
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:38.720]   to these college kids met him. He went to their like, you know, frat house. He cooked them dinner
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.440]   and then he got a guitar out with them and he sang gangster paradise with them and he like,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:49.760]   orchestrated it with the crowd singing whatever he was. Then there was a video of him in Dublin
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.080]   on the bar singing. Can I just say something to I've given the message?
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:58:00.960]   Before Yeah, before but like, you know, take care of your health. Yeah, take care like,
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:07.280]   there there there are these incredible drugs. I just want to call out health as wealth. If
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.720]   Lipitor, for example, or Crestor, or these statins are not working for you. There's this next
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:20.080]   generation kind of drug called the PCSK9 inhibitor, which essentially is effectively a gene therapy
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.520]   that's modeled after this very specific group of folks in the Nordics, I believe, who actually have
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.920]   effectively immunity against heart disease. And so it's taken 20 years to refine this drug. But
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.000]   this drug is a wonder drug. And you know, there are versions of it now that are injectable,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.200]   you know, once every six months or whatever. So go and ask your doctor if you're not if statins
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:44.960]   don't work for you look at the PCSK9 inhibitor. And then separately after you're 45 or so you should
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:52.400]   get a CT angiogram because these things are really important or you know, a heart flow
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:58.320]   where they actually inject a dye, they characterize all your veins, they give you a calcium score
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.400]   may not prevent this, but at least if it's if it's something cardiac related, you can get to
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:10.480]   the bottom of it. And it's a knowable thing nowadays. Yeah, rest in power to our friend.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.560]   And yeah, take care of yourselves, your health. And speaking of health, shout out to Gwyneth
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:26.080]   Paltrow, GPAL, who in her goop newsletter pointed out that she loves the all in pod and has to be
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.600]   honest. She's obsessed with the personalities a little bit. Anybody want to handicap that?
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.920]   Listen, let's be honest. One,
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.800]   not you. If that's what you're trying to say, I've met her actually. Doctors say
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:43.040]   she's a delightful if you want it, if you want to live in health after a meal, the best thing to eat
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:48.640]   is a little dark chocolate. Hmm. Do you get your dark chocolate from goop? Do you have goop dark
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.560]   chocolate? Jason, I was trying to make a story where I am the dark chocolate where I'm saying
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:57.760]   that I am her favorite personality, you fucking moron. So you're handicapping that you're her
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.360]   favorite. She said she's obsessed with personalities plural. I'm gonna I'm gonna
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:07.040]   what if she rank her besties I need to know. I'm gonna rank as free bird. Oh, really? You
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:14.240]   think that makes that sound? Yeah. Okay. Then me then you. Okay, I'll take it. The fact that
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:20.160]   Gwyneth Paltrow even understands like who we are is a win in my book. So I'll be number four on her
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.120]   list. But G pal, if you could rank the besties in your next newsletter, that would be appreciated.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:33.360]   And we'll we'll take your besties. G pal. All right, if Sacha wants some red meat,
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.600]   you I saw you wrote a piece you want your red meat? Should we throw it to you? Yeah,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.160]   yeah. All right. Well, I mean, I think we need a Ukraine update because I mean,
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.640]   we're talking about all the reasons that there could be a silver lining or the markets bottomed
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.680]   out. I don't think you can know for sure the markets are gonna bottom out unless you know
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:57.120]   that there's going to be a successful resolution of this Ukraine war, at least a non escalation of
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.000]   it. And all the things that have happened in the last couple weeks have been on the road towards
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.600]   escalation. Exactly. So in the last like, just few days, you've had Zelensky saying that they want to
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.880]   be admitted to NATO. You've got Putin basically annexing or saying he's going to annex the Don
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.320]   Bass. And somebody we don't know who but according to Radek Sikorsky, who's the Polish foreign
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.240]   minister, he think the US somebody blew up the Nord pipeline. So what is the common denominator?
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.880]   They say was blown up was one or two was this?
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.360]   One. So it was the one that was actually like working. What is the common denominator of all
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.200]   these things? They're all eliminating key elements of what a peace deal would look like. So everyone
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.040]   understands that a peace deal would require Zelensky to give up on NATO, it would require
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:52.560]   Putin to make some compromises, likely in the Don Bass, and it would require the sanctions to be
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.400]   lifted and the energy flows to be turned back on. Well, so now those things basically have been
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.280]   removed from the table, or at least potentially, that's what's happening. So I don't see how you're
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.360]   going to get a peace deal now. And so if you remove all the off ramps, what's left escalation?
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.560]   Well, to me, this thing's just going to keep escalating.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.240]   I thought you wrote a good piece in the American conservative should America go all in on Ukraine,
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.080]   if you haven't read it, it is 80% of rehash of what we've talked about here for the last year.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:28.000]   But there's 20% new in it, I think. And I thought what was interesting, in terms of new stuff,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   you put in the piece, and it's a good summary of, you know, poker strategy versus what's going on
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.880]   here, is that we've already proven, you know, if you did want to prove that Russia is not a threat,
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.520]   with the exception of their nuclear, we now have proven that they're really not going to be able
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.680]   to do a domino and go into all these different countries, with the exception of obviously,
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.800]   the threat of nuclear power. So I thought that that was a point. Yeah, what I was really responding
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:58.400]   to in that piece is the assertion by the media that Putin is bluffing. How do they know that?
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:06.640]   You know, I think all of us understand poker pretty well. And none of us ever would have the
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:13.760]   confidence to assert that we know exactly what cards our opponent holds in any given hand and
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.960]   how exactly they'll play them. What do we do? What do smart players do? We put our opponent on a
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:25.760]   range, a range of possible hands, of possibilities. And then we evaluate, what did their previous
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.720]   actions tell us? What story are they telling through their previous actions? Well, what story
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.080]   has Putin been telling? This is not a guy who bluffs, in my opinion, or at least that is not
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:41.440]   the story. There's a chance he would pop off a tactical nuke. It's a nonzero chance. I think
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:48.480]   if that if his life is on the line, he is incentivized to use every weapon at his disposal
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.960]   to try and prevent his violent life isn't on the line here. He can take it back out. Yeah,
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.200]   but where's this thing headed? If there's no compromise? I think they you know, I'm going
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.840]   to stick with my original prediction that we wanted to ankle Putin, we wanted to prove he
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.760]   didn't have, you know, as much strength as he did. And we wanted to exhaust his resources. So
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:12.240]   we could finally basically get him out of office at some point. So I do think regime change via
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.200]   exhausting him. And I think it seems to have worked. We have exhausted. You're agreeing with
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.280]   me. I agree that we have exhausted his I mean, he's proven he can't fight a ground war, right?
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.600]   I mean, that that's a pretty he's escalating. Now. He's escalating. You think he's just gonna
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.560]   roll over? He's not gonna roll. I think he but I think what we've proven haven't we is that
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.000]   he can't fight a ground war effectively. He doesn't have the army. He doesn't have the weapons
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.760]   compared to the West. And he's been exhausted. You know, and I think his he's spent now. The
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.960]   only thing he has left is what you're talking about is the nuclear option. Literally,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.160]   no, no, well, no, there's, there's more intermediate options. First of all,
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.280]   he's just called for the the mobilization of 300,000 more troops. So that's going for step one.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.200]   People are leaving the country.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.600]   Yeah, exactly. Look, there's gonna be very high cost on the Russian side. Yeah, there's gonna
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.080]   be very high costs on the Russian side. I would not assume that means that there's something in
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:12.320]   it for us. So what I'm saying is, even with this, you know, the the conscription he's doing this
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.520]   draft, he's doing forced draft. I mean, he is kind of redundant. But this conscription or draft,
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.360]   whatever you want to call it, has proven that he doesn't even actually have the standing inside his
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.000]   own country. People are leaving. They're breaking, they're looking about to break their arms. Like
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.440]   it's, it's pretty dark. I think you're making a lot of assumptions there, just like the media
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.720]   who are saying that he is definitely bluffing. What I'm saying is we cannot know that he's
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:38.640]   definitely bluffing. Now, the United States of America is blessed with being the most safe and
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.520]   secure country in the world and really in human history. And the history is full of humans constantly
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.000]   being at war with each other. So that is a really valuable thing that we have. Why are we so secure?
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   We're surrounded by gigantic oceans. We have these gigantic moats. In addition, thanks to the wisdom
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.880]   of the Monroe Doctrine, for 200 years, we have prevented any great powers from getting a foothold
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.280]   in the Western Hemisphere. We are completely dominant here. And no one could ever stage an
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.520]   invasion of the United States. We only have one vulnerability, just one, ICBMs. That's really it.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.880]   So what are we doing? We are basically engaging in a proxy war with the person in the world who
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.280]   has the most ICBMs. And we are basically putting ourselves on an escalatory path with him. This
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   would be like if Achilles had gone in front of the walls of Troy and basically taken off his armor
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.840]   and stuck his foot in the air and drawn a little bullseye around his, his heel. That is what we're
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.080]   doing. The other side in the world, why would we do that? Why would we do that?
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.520]   If they are the last real threat, and they are the Achilles heel, if we can,
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.600]   they're not the last threat. They're not the last threat. We're never going to be out of threats.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.560]   Okay. Well, we got two major ones with ICBMs. But anyway, it looks like we're in the endgame. Now,
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.080]   what do you think happens here? We're not in the endgame. We're on a path towards escalation,
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.560]   because all the off ramps have been removed. That's my point. And instead of saying instead
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.280]   of trying to find a diplomatic solution, first of all, we keep removing off ramps. And then we,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.120]   we blithely disregard the threat to ourselves by saying he must be bluffing. This is incredibly
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:16.080]   stupid. The better question to ask is, hold on a second. The better question to ask is,
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:21.200]   what's in it for us? What's in it for the United States of America? What is the vital interest
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:27.680]   that compels us to risk our security? There isn't one. This Donbass region, hold on, this Donbass
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:33.920]   region is the Franz Ferdinand of this situation. It is not historically important to us. We have
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:40.560]   invested in it all of this importance. And we are potentially turning a regional war into a world
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.360]   war. We are sleepwalking towards this. Unless somebody finds an off ramp, we are escalating
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.640]   our way into a much larger conflict. That is my point. And I don't see how anyone I don't see
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.400]   anyone should reenter the markets with this geopolitical risk hanging over our heads.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.520]   Yeah, this is kind of like what I said a few weeks ago, and JP Morgan put out a
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.360]   analyst report today saying that they were shifting from being, you know, call it roughly
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.120]   positive, sort of like Chamath's point earlier about being a little bit constructive in the
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:16.000]   markets right now and coming in and finding opportunities to buy to realizing that the sum
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.720]   of the portfolio of tail risks right now, you know, outweighs the upside that may arise from
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.280]   finding these low priced opportunities in the market. And that seems to be the prevailing market
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:34.720]   sentiment right now, is that there are too many of these moments that while each one of them is low
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:40.640]   probability, the impact is of such high severity that the aggregate value, expected value or
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:44.880]   expected loss of all of them is actually quite significant. And that is heavily weighing on the
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.440]   market. And so to Chamath's point, I think, and to the question earlier about market conditions,
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.040]   one catalyst for upside in the market, while there is fiscal strain and economic strain and
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.840]   growth strain, there is also this geopolitical strain in the market. If one or more of these
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.760]   things starts to resolve, I think that weight starts to come off the markets. And you can see
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.000]   Oh, yeah, look, I can see the market taking off like a rocket if Ukraine gets resolved.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.160]   And I do think you're right. It's all fat tail risk.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.440]   That can be resolved. I think that can potentially be the political motivation here,
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.840]   which is that enough people like Chamath and you start making the calls to your representatives
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.280]   pointing out how strained the market is because of this tension in the region right now, that maybe
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.880]   there is some path to resolution that becomes more active rather than passive. Because this may be
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.400]   a little controversial, so we can talk about it. But I think that the markets would have reacted
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:46.160]   much, much more negatively to a nuclear incident three months ago than now,
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.640]   and may not even react as much as we may think it was three months from now.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.880]   What do you mean by nuclear? You mean a nuke goes off or just a threat?
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.800]   You're saying if Putin blows up a nuke, the markets may not react that much.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:10.320]   I think that the markets are basically ring fencing Russia, Ukraine risk in terms of
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:17.840]   currency instability, but that's sort of now gone away. We've ring fenced the energy risk
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.800]   because it looks like energy reserves in Europe are actually going to be pretty meaningful. They're
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.080]   going to spend whatever it takes. So all of the second and third order effects, it would be a
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.520]   humanitarian crisis, which would be horrendous. But the markets don't, whether we like it or not,
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.760]   react to humanitarian crises. They react to the second and third order economic impacts of those
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.440]   things. And if you actually try to think about what the second and third order economic impacts are,
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.800]   you're seeing many of those things get solved. And so what it would be, it would be a highly
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:58.880]   isolating effect, it would be a humanitarian atrocity, he would be completely cornered from a
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:08.480]   worldwide perspective. The monetary and fiscal implications of that may not be as meaningfully
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.680]   disruptive today as they would have been three months ago. That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.280]   Well, one thing I should clarify, I like freeberg's analysis of the fat tail risk,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.600]   because I'm not saying it's likely that this conflict goes nuclear, but I don't need there
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.520]   to be a high likelihood in order for me to be very concerned about it because of how disastrous
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.200]   an outcome that would be. So if you're doing an expected value analysis, it's really hard to
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.160]   analyze the expected value or negative value of a low probability disastrous event, right? That's
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.400]   the classic fat tail risk. I do think that if the markets think they have priced in the effect of
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   this war, then I think that's an argument for a lot of downside to this market. Because it seems
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.200]   to me that we're on a one way ratchet here, all the off ramps for a peace or a diplomatic solution
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.480]   have been systematically taken away. And all that's left are potential escalations. So
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.920]   no, I hear you. But how did those translate those escalations to outside of those two countries
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   and into economic terms for the rest of the world?
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.840]   Oh, my gosh. Well, I mean, if the war spreads here, I'll give you a couple of scenarios. I mean,
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.640]   well, here's one, I think we're just assuming that China's going to stay out of it. Imagine if
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.720]   you're China, and you're watching what's happening, and you're worried that actually
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:32.400]   Russia could lose this war so badly, that it emboldens hawks in America, who want to target
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.600]   China next, you know, who are basically on this global struggle against autocracy, you're going
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.800]   to look at that and go, wait a second, is it really in our interest for Putin and Russia to
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:49.280]   be completely toppled by this global struggle against autocracy? It seems to me they could enter
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.000]   the Russian side, not militarily, but in terms of support. So they would have an incentive, again,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.720]   not to lose an ally. And then by the same token, I think the Russians could lash out, I don't think
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.880]   they're going to go nuclear right away. But I think they could pull a Grozny. I mean, don't
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.680]   you think that...
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.200]   Explain what that is. Explain it.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.560]   Well, when, you know, in the Chechen War, when Russia was losing, they just
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.480]   rubbled Grozny. I mean, they basically leveled it to the ground. So I mean, Putin hasn't done
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:23.200]   anything like that yet. But if he's facing defeat, isn't that something that would be on the escalatory
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.760]   ladder is to basically start leveling Ukrainian cities, destroying key infrastructure, all that
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.720]   stuff? And then what is the response to the West? Because the West may say, you know what,
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.680]   that's unacceptable to us.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.320]   I agree. No, no, no, I look, I'm not debating how bad all of these things are. I'm just asking
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:45.120]   the question, what are the second and third order economic impacts because the market doesn't reflect
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.080]   human atrocities, we may want it to, but it just doesn't do a good job of that it does do a
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.600]   reasonable job of reflecting a discounted set of events in the future related to economic events
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.640]   and impacts. And all I'm saying is that, you know, the most obvious impacts of this war have been to
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   currencies to commodities and to energy. And the world has had six or seven months to reroute what
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:15.520]   they've needed to roughly solve a large percentage of those problems. It doesn't take the fact that
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.040]   this is a bad war, and it should end. I'm not saying any of it.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.960]   Right, right. No, look, you make you make a good point, which is that look, the market discounts
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:29.040]   cash flow. So how did the cash flows get impacted? You may be right that valuation multiples have
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:34.400]   gotten close to correction. But I think the thing that we don't really know is what earnings and
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   profits and revenues are going to look like next year. And part of that is about the hard landing,
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.840]   right? Like how inflated are all these companies revenues and earnings because of what I hear you,
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.760]   I hear you. But this is why that chart is so important. Every other time, except in 1983,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.880]   in modern history. So the modern history that we have all lived, says that the stock market
