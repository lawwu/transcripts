[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   how much risk are they taking, what could they lose?
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.480]   - I would say for the stock market,
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.960]   which we know is much more volatile,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.160]   let's use the most recent bear market as an example.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.680]   Typically in a bear market,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.720]   which we know happens roughly once every five years,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.800]   the average loss is about 30%.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   What you can also look forward to though is,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.520]   you know, the gains can be pretty high in the good years.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.720]   Five of the last 20 years,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.120]   the stock market was up more than 20%.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.960]   The average return was 26%.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.200]   And so that's a pretty good year.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.840]   Imagine compounding your asset,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.320]   your net worth by that amount.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960]   - Well, I think that is one area
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   where real estate does stand out versus equities.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.240]   That is unusual to see large drops in home prices.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.480]   The real name of the game with real estate
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480]   and the way you mitigate against volatility is just time.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.640]   This is not a quick get in and get out strategy.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.000]   The risk of principal loss is actually,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   I think significantly less than in the stock market.
