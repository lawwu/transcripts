[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.820]   - Yesterday we talked about gifting a body to science,
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.760]   a natural question from your cremation article.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.660]   The most unexpected follow-up question
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.960]   from your cremation article is on wedding summer
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.620]   from here in Minnesota.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.040]   Writes on to ask this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.900]   "in your recent article on cremation, you wrote,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.860]   "'Pastors should lead the way in cultivating a church ethos
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.860]   "'where expensive funerals and weddings are not the norm.'"
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.020]   End quote.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.420]   This is something I hadn't given much thought to before
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.620]   and really appreciated, thank you.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.580]   I was hoping you could speak more directly
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.580]   on the topic of expensive weddings.
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.060]   How can we design a Christ-exalting, simple wedding?
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.160]   - I will have a plea to couples in a minute
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.460]   for courage to be counter-cultural in this regard
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.500]   'cause that's what it's gonna take.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.700]   But I'm mainly pleading with pastors in that article
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.180]   to take the initiative to teach and preach
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.700]   and help in the church to build a culture
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.340]   of simplicity in the church
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.100]   that makes the focus of marriage celebrations
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700]   the Lord Jesus, the Christ-exalting meaning of marriage,
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.900]   the awesome importance of the vows,
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.600]   the preciousness of the people, the lovers,
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.960]   and not the clothing, the flowers,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.540]   the location, the music, the whole production
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.660]   that can make the actual act of God in marriage
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.380]   seem like an incidental prelude
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.340]   to the big fancy party afterwards.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's sad, I think.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.860]   But of course, this is not an attack on joy.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.180]   Just the opposite.
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.180]   It's a plea for drinking from the deepest pools of joy,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.060]   not the peripheral puddles of happiness.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560]   I mean, besides, godly poor people,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   godly poor people regularly have more joy than rich people.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.660]   There's no correlation between expensive and joyful, none,
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.240]   unless it's this, more expensive means more hassle,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   more stress, more distraction, less joyful.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.560]   So this is a plea to leaders
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280]   to cultivate an expectation of simplicity
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   so no one with modest means, and that's a lot of people,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   feel like a simple wedding
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   with a mince and nuts reception, no meal, no dance,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.100]   just joy, is somehow less honoring to the Lord
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.140]   than the couple, that's tragic
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.380]   if we've cultivated a situation like that.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.060]   Now here's the underlying worldview.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.900]   She was asking why.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.580]   A decisive turn happened in redemptive history
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.980]   when Jesus came into the world.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.900]   The Old Testament was by and large a come and see religion,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.420]   while the New Testament is largely a go tell religion.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260]   That's why there is a lavish expenditure
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.000]   in the Old Testament on the temple.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.300]   Come see from Egypt and from Ethiopia
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.180]   and from the ends of the earth,
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.180]   come see this expensive temple that we've built
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.560]   and why wealth was seen so regularly
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.220]   as a sign of God's blessing.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.040]   Now that has radically changed
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.700]   with the coming of the son of man
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.140]   who had no place to lay his head
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.020]   and told us to go risk our lives to disciple the nations.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.220]   We're not living in the Old Testament times.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.580]   This is not a come see religion.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.580]   Christianity doesn't even have a center geographically.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.500]   This is a go tell religion.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.940]   So the revolution is in the use of our resources.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.020]   What governs our lifestyle now is the effort to show
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.300]   that our treasure is in heaven and not on the earth.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.460]   What governs us is the effort to maximize our giving,
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.860]   to finish the great commission
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.540]   and love the hurting of the world.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.940]   The New Testament is relentless in pushing us
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.020]   towards simplicity and economy for the kingdom
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.340]   and away from luxury and away from affluence
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.420]   and away from finery, including luxurious weddings.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.700]   So just to give you a taste of what I mean
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.300]   when I say it's relentless,
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.820]   Luke 6:20, "Blessed are you poor
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.380]   for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.020]   Woe to you rich for you have received your consolation."
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   Luke 8, 14, "The word is choked by the cares
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.620]   and riches and pleasures of life."
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.420]   Luke 9, 58, "The son of man has no place to lay his head."
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.660]   Matthew 6, 19, "Don't lay up for yourselves treasures
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.980]   on earth where moth and rust destroy."
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.540]   Luke 6, 25, "I tell you, don't be anxious about your life.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.340]   Life is more than food and clothing."
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.340]   Luke 12, 33, "Sell your possessions, give alms,
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.540]   provide yourselves with purses in heaven."
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.300]   Luke 14, 33, "Whoever does not renounce all that he has
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.900]   cannot be my disciple."
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.860]   Luke 18, 24, "How hard it is for those who have riches
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.300]   to enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.060]   2 Corinthians 6, 9, "Paul was poor yet making many rich.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.660]   He had nothing yet possessed all things."
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.500]   1 Timothy 6, 7, "We brought nothing into the world.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   We can't take anything out of the world.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.620]   But if we have food and clothing,
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.500]   with these we will be content."
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.940]   Hebrews 10, 34, "You joyfully accepted the plundering
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.060]   of your property since you yourselves knew
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.060]   you had a better possession and an abiding one."
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.180]   When Noel and I were married,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.620]   she wore her mother's wedding dress free.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.780]   No, she had some alterations to make.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.620]   Probably a few dollars.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.460]   I wore my best and only Sunday suit.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.980]   My best man did the same.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.540]   Her matron of honor wore a nice Sunday dress.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.500]   We had an open Bible and a cross on the platform
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.060]   just to show what our values were.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.180]   The church organ was played.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.900]   My father preached.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.300]   The church provided a reception,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.620]   which was in the church fellowship hall.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.700]   No meal, no refreshments.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.980]   There was a cake.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.420]   I borrowed my father's car to go on a honeymoon,
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.620]   seven hour drive to St. Petersburg, Florida,
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.100]   where we stayed in a single story motel on the beach.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.220]   It was all simple.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.780]   It was all full of joy.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.900]   It was explosive with happy expectation.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.020]   Nobody borrowed any money.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.940]   The Lord, the word, the vows, the lovers were the foreground
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.260]   and God was honored.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.740]   And we are just as married 47 years later as anybody.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.700]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.940]   Now, let me stress again,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.380]   there is a place for special.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.580]   Okay, hear me?
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.100]   There is a place for special, special dress,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.740]   special expenditures, special beauty
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.940]   in the simplicity of the Christian life.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.540]   There's a place for beauty.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.420]   But what is happening in the evangelical church today,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.860]   it seems to me, is careening out of control.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.300]   And somebody needs to put the brakes on.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.420]   And I'm pleading with pastors especially,
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.940]   let the service and the word and the vows
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   and the Lord and the love be the main thing.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.420]   There does not have to be a meal after the wedding.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.140]   Believe me, there doesn't.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.060]   There doesn't have to be a dance.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.020]   It doesn't have to be an expensive hotel.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.540]   There doesn't have to be a paid quintet.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.020]   Really, it doesn't have to be.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.700]   So besides pastors who lead on this,
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.180]   we need young people with backbone
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.500]   and radical Christian courage to stand against a culture
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.180]   and show what truth and beauty and joy can look like
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.660]   at one fourth the cost and one fourth the anxieties
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.820]   and one fourth the stress and double the focus
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.100]   on the glory of Christ and the advancement of his kingdom.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.180]   - Wow, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.100]   That is powerful.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.260]   And this episode reminds me that we have a free book
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260]   on our site titled "Preparing for Marriage,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.940]   "Help for Christian Couples."

[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.020]   And we will talk more about marriage in about a week
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.900]   on the question of should I finish school
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.820]   before I get married?
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.500]   I know that's a question that you and Noel
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.380]   were faced with as well.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.660]   But for now, thank you for listening
