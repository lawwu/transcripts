[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   All right, we've got time for a couple more quick questions.
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.340]   We have one here from Cindy.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.080]   Cindy says, "I'm starting my fourth try
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080]   "to do a digital detox.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.420]   "I just can't seem to make it to 30 days.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.200]   "What is your advice?"
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.040]   Well, first of all, Cindy,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.420]   I think we might diagnose part of the problem
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.940]   in just the words you were using.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.620]   You called what you're trying to do a detox.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I don't use the phrase digital detox.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.300]   If you read the book "Digital Minimalism"
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300]   where I'm assuming you're extracting this plan
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.020]   to spend 30 days away from optional technologies,
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620]   I call it a digital declutter.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.260]   There's a reason why I make that distinction.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.580]   It's because in the context of digital tools,
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.820]   detox has taken on this very specific
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.060]   and I think very weird meaning, right?
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.500]   It means I want to white-knuckle separate myself
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.780]   away from these services that I spend too much time on
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.860]   because I don't like that I spend so much time on them
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.020]   and I want to detoxify my addictive urge to use them.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140]   The reason why I say that's a weird application of the term
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700]   is that, of course, in the substance abuse community
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.140]   where the notion of detox
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140]   or the relevant notion of detox comes from,
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.380]   the whole idea is not taking a break
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.820]   but to completely change your life.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.020]   That it's the first step as part of transforming your life
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.100]   so that you don't use that substance anymore.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.780]   In the digital world, we just say, "It's a break.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.680]   "I don't like this thing, so let me just be away from it
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.820]   "and that will somehow make my life better."
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.180]   Declutter, on the other hand, says, "No,
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.880]   "we're not just staying away from that closet
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.660]   "that has too much stuff in it.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.900]   "We're gonna take everything out
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.340]   "and just put back the stuff that matters.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.660]   "We're gonna make the closet permanently better."
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.140]   And that is what I think you need to do
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.540]   for your digital life.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.180]   So the key thing that separates a declutter from a detox
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180]   is that you don't just white-knuckle it.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.500]   You don't just sit there and say,
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.980]   "Don't use Instagram, don't use Instagram,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.340]   "don't use Instagram," and hope you make it 30 days.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.840]   You instead have to be incredibly active,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.060]   aggressively reflecting and experimenting
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.300]   to rediscover the things that you really care about
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.140]   in your life.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.620]   These 30 days should be busy.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.400]   You should have lots of plans, lots of things you're doing.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.500]   You're going over here, you're going with friends here,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.060]   you're going to this museum, you're reading these books,
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.700]   you've joined this club, you're doing a new online class.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   'Cause what you're trying to do is get back in touch
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.220]   in the absence of all these distractions
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.540]   with what you really care about.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.880]   And then when you're done with the 30-day declutter,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.180]   you rebuild your digital life from scratch.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.660]   You don't go back to what you were doing before.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.120]   You don't never use technology again.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.920]   Instead, you say, "Okay, now that I've rebuilt my life
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.820]   "around activities that are important to me,
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.020]   "initiatives that are important to me,
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.900]   "what tools will help me with this?"
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.980]   And you very intentionally bring technology
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.640]   back into your life, but you deploy it very strategically
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.260]   to support the things you care about.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.900]   And everything that doesn't support something
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.220]   you care about, you just ignore.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.540]   And the stuff you do bring back in,
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.820]   you put nice gates around, nice fences around,
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.780]   you have rules about when you use it,
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.900]   how you use it, et cetera.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.300]   That's the digital declutter.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.020]   So the reason why I would diagnose you
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.940]   are probably having trouble with these detoxes
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.060]   is that you're just trying to white knuckle it.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.940]   And that's not very successful.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.900]   And I've seen that in the large number of people
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.820]   who have gone through these experiments on my behalf
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.980]   and told me about how it went,
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.220]   is that the people that just try to stay away
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.140]   from the technologies they don't like, struggle.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.340]   Those that instead say,
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.100]   while I'm staying away from those technologies,
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.620]   I'm rebuilding my life and rediscovering what I care about,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.220]   don't struggle.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.460]   Change that is built around a aspirational,
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.700]   positive vision of your life
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.220]   is always way more sustainable than change built around
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.140]   just avoiding things that you're assessing to be negative.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.960]   So Cindy, that's my advice.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.500]   Go back and read that chapter in "Digital Minimalism"
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.940]   and focus on the active part.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.420]   The stuff you have to do instead,
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.820]   the replacements, the discovery, the reflection.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.180]   And I think that's where you're gonna find a key
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.140]   to succeeding with your declutter.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.640]   (upbeat music)
