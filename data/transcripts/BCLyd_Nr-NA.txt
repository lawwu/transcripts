[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.380]   - Jacob from Olive Branch, Mississippi writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.220]   Pastor John, I'm a 20 year old college student.
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.700]   I love to read theology,
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.540]   but sometimes I find it incredibly difficult to do.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.580]   I especially enjoy reading Jonathan Edwards and John Owen.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.420]   Reading theology, however, is hard.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.720]   It's not like other genres
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.740]   where you can read large passages straight through.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.820]   I often find myself splitting my reading
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.520]   into short segments.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.760]   My question is how do you, Pastor John,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.400]   read the works of men like Owen and Edwards?
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880]   What tips do you have for people like myself who enjoy it,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.920]   but also struggle with it?
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.440]   - If by struggle, Jacob,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.020]   you mean when reading Owen and Edwards,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.960]   you must slow down and take it in smaller sections
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.040]   so that you can ponder it and digest it,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.640]   then this is the kind of struggle
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   I think everybody should have, should have,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.480]   not must have, but should have.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.360]   That kind of reading is exactly the way
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200]   I think Owen and Edwards should be read.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.360]   I say almost everybody.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.960]   You know, almost everybody should read it like that
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.260]   because there are a few geniuses in the world, all right?
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.680]   I know that.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.880]   Some of them have asked me why I do certain things.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.160]   I say, because I'm a cripple.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.200]   I use a crutch because I'm a cripple.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.320]   I'm not like you.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.040]   A genius can read maybe 50 pages at a sitting,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.440]   remember it all, understand it all,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.240]   reproduce it all, use it all.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   I'm not like that.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.960]   Neither are most human beings.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.240]   So no one should measure himself by people like that.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.720]   Nobody should build seminary curricula for people like that.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.260]   Nobody should assign reading lists for people like that.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.600]   Nobody should develop pedagogy for people like that.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.920]   There are only one or two in the world,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.140]   maybe 10 or 100 or 1,000, but they're not in our classes.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.080]   They're not in our churches by and large.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.360]   They can make their own way.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.020]   They don't need anybody to plan anything for them.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.920]   So you and me, Jacob, we're normal,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.960]   and we need to talk about this.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.640]   So thank you for asking the question.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   So back to the question.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   How do I read Owen and Edwards?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.240]   And what tips do I have for you to read him
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.840]   if you're struggling with longer sections?
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200]   And since I'm one of you, my answer to the first question,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   how do I read, really is the answer to the second question,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.120]   what are my tips for you?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   So I'll simply give you some specific examples
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.100]   that I remember reading Owen and Edwards.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.680]   Back in the late '70s, when I bought my first edition,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   two volumes of Edwards, they were published in 1974
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.400]   by Banner of Truth.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.240]   I got them probably in '77.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.200]   I can't remember exactly what year.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   And I decided, having flipped through the first volume,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   okay, I want to read the Doctrine of Original Sin.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.280]   There it is, tiny print, two columns, many, many pages.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.440]   How shall I do this?
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.780]   And I knew that I had little time
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.940]   for extracurricular reading on top of all my class
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.320]   preparations and everything,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.800]   when I was teaching at Bethel College.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.240]   And so I decided I would read
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.320]   the Doctrine of Original Sin by Jonathan Edwards,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.680]   15 minutes a day.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   I think it was just before supper that I set it apart,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   a little alarm on my clock, ding, 5.15,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.980]   gonna go up and eat at 5.30, start reading Edwards now.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.600]   Stop 15 minutes later.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.580]   And I got it out and I looked,
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.000]   and it's just marked all up.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.040]   It's underlined, it's got notes in the margins,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   it's got exclamation points, it's got comments,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.100]   it's got lines drawn.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.200]   You can't do that at 50 pages a shot.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   You can't read like that.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   I did the same thing in 1972, this is earlier now,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   '73 with an old musty copy of Religious Affections,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.780]   'cause the two volumes hadn't been published yet,
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.160]   in Germany during graduate school.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.000]   It was my Sunday evening church service by myself
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.300]   in a rocking chair in the corner of my room
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.760]   in Munich, Germany, reading once a week.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.740]   And it took me a long time to get through that book.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.100]   It was glorious.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.920]   It was life-changing to meet Edwards slowly
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.880]   in little chunks in Religious Affections.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.280]   Here's one more example.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.760]   When I came to Bethlehem to be the pastor in 1980,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.920]   I wanted to get more clarity
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.480]   on the doctrine of particular redemption.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.880]   So I put John Owen's "Death of Death"
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.920]   from his collected works on my bedside table
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.180]   and resolved I will read what I can,
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.920]   little bit, 10, 15 minutes before I go to bed every night.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.480]   Strange time to read one of the heaviest books,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.920]   but I did it.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.520]   I've got it marked up.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.620]   It was solidifying and very helpful.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.180]   And that's the way I have read many things.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.200]   So here's a massive hope giver, I hope,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   to everybody who's like me, who not only reads slowly,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.240]   but has a hard time putting pieces together as they read
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.000]   and has a hard time remembering what they read.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I wrote for people like that on page 129 in my book,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "When I Don't Desire God, These Words."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.160]   Suppose you read slowly like I do,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.800]   maybe about 200 words a minute,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.080]   which is about the speed at which I'm talking.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.080]   Now, probably, if you read 15 minutes a day for one year,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.520]   say just before supper or just before bed,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.480]   you will read 5,475 minutes in the year.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.400]   Multiply that by 200 words a minute
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.560]   and you get 1,095,000 words
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   that you would have read in a year.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   Now, an average serious book
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.400]   might have about 360 words per page.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.700]   I counted some and made an average.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.700]   So you would read 3,041 pages in one year
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.520]   during that 15-minute slot.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.680]   That's 10 very substantial books,
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   all in 15 minutes a day.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.160]   Or let's be more specific.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.520]   John Calvin's Institutes, in the two volume that I have,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   is 1,521 pages in two volumes
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.660]   with an average of 400 words per page,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.720]   which is 608,000 words.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.840]   That means that even if you took a day off,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.160]   let's just do six days a week,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.920]   took a day off every week,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.320]   you could read this great biblical vision
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.880]   of God and man, the Institutes,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.640]   in about 33 weeks at 15 minutes a day,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760]   and you would be doing other reading besides.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.520]   So, Jacob, take heart.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.960]   You call it a struggle.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.880]   You can drop that word.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.040]   This is a blessing.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.080]   It is a gift that you enjoy, great theologians,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.280]   and it's a gift that you can't
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.060]   breeze through them quickly.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.360]   The world has enough people in it
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.680]   who read to say they have read.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   It needs more people who care very little for pace
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.020]   and care very deeply about going deep.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.320]   So be that kind of reader.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.760]   - Wonderful, yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.420]   Okay, quickly, for someone new to Jonathan Edwards,
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.260]   where should they start?
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.060]   Should they start with charity and its fruits?
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.520]   - No, I wouldn't start with charity.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   My wife and I read charity in Germany on the couch
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.360]   a little bit every night, and frankly, found it wordy.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.000]   I don't think it's written as well as Edwards' other books.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.440]   I'm not sure why that is.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.200]   I think it doesn't, I mean, everybody says
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.040]   Edwards is hard to read.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.560]   I think charity, at least in parts of it,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.640]   not the last chapter, Heaven is a World of Love
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.080]   is in a class by itself.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.560]   I mean, that's a classic.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.600]   Everybody should read that,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.680]   even if they don't read the rest of the chapters.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.520]   I would generally say start with some sermons,
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.880]   collection of sermons, but if you're gonna take a big book,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.800]   I would start with Religious Affections.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   Religious Affections proved to me
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   the most devotionally satisfying
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.080]   of all the works of Edwards.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.800]   Reading it on a Sunday night in Germany for weeks on end
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.320]   while my heart was being dismantled
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.520]   by the laying back of the onion of sin
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   and the description of the beauties of holiness,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   I would just, I would send them there
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.480]   if they are a very academic type
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.000]   and they really wanna tackle something hard,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.560]   I think Edwards' greatest book is The Freedom of the Will.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.600]   But that's no place for a beginner to start.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.880]   Devotionally, I think sermons like
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   the Excellency of Christ or a divine and spiritual light
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.760]   immediately imparted to the soul
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   or on the fatherhood of God or Christ's agony,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.480]   I mean, those are just sermons that stand out in my memory
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.960]   as precious or the Religious Affections.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   - Very good, excellent, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.160]   And this episode reminds me of episode number 99
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.520]   back when I asked the cliche question I know,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.320]   "Stranded on a desert island, what books do you bring?"
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.920]   You can find Pastor John's answer
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.680]   in episode number 99 of this podcast
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   and you can find it at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   At the top of the page, click on the tab that says More
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.560]   and then click on Ask Pastor John.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.200]   There you can search hundreds of past episodes,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.920]   you can get the free apps
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.680]   and you can ask John Piper a bewildering question.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.560]   All that and all made possible
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.240]   because of our generous financial donors
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.960]   who are behind the mission of Desiring God
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.160]   who make this podcast possible
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.800]   and who I know are listening right now, thank you.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.520]   Well, when you look at Christ, what do you see in him?
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.880]   The answer to that question determines everything
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.500]   and Pastor John will explain why tomorrow.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.120]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
