[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.060]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 21.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.300]   On today's show, stocks, bonds, and derivatives.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100]   What do those words mean?
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.640]   What are these financial instruments that we hear about so much?
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.340]   How do they work and why should you care?
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:11.860]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Wednesday, July 16, 2014.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.120]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.060]   I've been looking forward to this topic.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.420]   It's one of my favorite topics.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.060]   It's basically to discuss and walk through the basics.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.480]   The basics of stocks, bonds, and derivatives.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.880]   To really establish a foundational knowledge of what these financial instruments are so
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840]   that you can understand how to use them in your life to better your goals.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:42.260]   A lot of times as a financial advisor, I would spend time working with clients and clients
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.900]   would ask me questions about their investments.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.900]   Clients would ask me questions about their 401ks, about markets, or things like that.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.420]   I always had this experience of trying to answer their questions directly.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.440]   With clients who were very financially literate, I found that it was easy and fun to answer
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.980]   the question to have a discussion.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.220]   I found that many clients did not have a high degree of comfort or literacy with the basic
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.180]   terms and the basic things that these words mean.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.000]   When you talk about stocks or you hear about the stock market, there are different pictures
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.220]   that come to everyone's head.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.620]   We want to understand what do these words actually mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.700]   We want to understand what they mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.880]   We want to understand what they mean so that we can have a real understanding of what they mean.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.400]   really relevant idea of how to interpret the news, how to interpret what we read and what
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.000]   we learn about.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900]   So on today's show, I'm going to try to unpack and build a foundational knowledge of
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.220]   understanding about stocks and bonds.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.120]   And so I hope you'll enjoy it, and I hope that it will be really valuable to you.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.820]   I think I'll probably be able to give you some information today that will be very
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.680]   relevant to your life, whether that's your life as an investor in publicly traded
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.520]   securities or whether that's relevant to your life as an individual with just some
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.820]   ideas about how you can use stocks and bonds within your own business or as a wealth
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.400]   transfer mechanism or in other ways.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440]   So we'll talk about that today.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.460]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.720]   Before we do that, I just want to get into a couple of announcements, and I want to lead
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.060]   off with announcement number one, which is thank you.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.740]   Thank you for listening.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.120]   And I really mean this from the bottom of my heart.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600]   I'm so thrilled with some of the feedback and the response that I've been starting
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.660]   to get.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.380]   On this show and some of the emails and the questions and the conversations that I'm
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.720]   having.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.660]   I'm so, so thrilled with this.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.260]   Yesterday was a record day for total number of downloads on the show.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.840]   It was really, really a record day.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.660]   And, you know, I don't remember if I've said this on the show or not.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.220]   I don't think I have, but you may wonder why am I doing this show.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.500]   And here's why I'm doing the show.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.640]   To me, my doing this show is an answer to.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.380]   My $10 million question.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.160]   I did a previous episode back in the handheld voice recorder.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.420]   The handheld voice recorder days.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.320]   Hopefully you can get through the audio quality.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.480]   And I talked about like, what do you want?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.380]   And I said a good question that has served me well in my own journaling and my own ideas
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.740]   and understanding is that is to sit down and start with what do I want?
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.280]   What do I really want out of life?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.760]   And so I, I, I find the $10 million question useful.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.080]   And basically the idea is.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.960]   Pretend you win $10 million income tax free in a lottery and you have now have 10 million bucks in the bank.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.880]   And I assume then you go and you give some money away to the people that you want to give money away to.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.740]   You buy some of the toys and the things that are on your list.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.160]   And you take some of it for me.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.540]   I take some trips or whatever the fun things are.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.480]   Now fast forward a year and you wake up on Monday morning a year later after that $10 million windfall.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.240]   And you still have plenty of the money, plenty of money in the bank.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.400]   You can live it your lifestyle without ever having to go to work again the rest of your life.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.920]   What would you do every day?
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   And I really feel like that question should form the foundation of financial planning.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.580]   What would you do every day?
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.300]   And no matter what you would do, there's probably a way to figure out how to do it now and skip the $10 million.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.860]   I really feel like this just makes sense to me.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.580]   And so in my answer to that question, if I did that, you know, as I try to think about it.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.800]   Now I'm pretty young, so I don't really know for sure.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.460]   And we won't know until we get to the $10 million.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.860]   And I can say, yes, this is exactly what I would do.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.600]   But I feel like my best answer so far.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.440]   Is that if I had $10 million in the bank, I would get up on Monday morning.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.400]   I would have a cup of coffee.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.920]   I would eat breakfast with my family.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.080]   I would go out to my nice office in a sunny window with a comfortable chair.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.860]   I would probably read some books on topics that I'm interested in.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.320]   Whether that's topics of investing or whether that's topics of finance.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.500]   Whether that's topics of financial planning.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.420]   Whether it's philosophy.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.000]   Whether it's politics.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.340]   I enjoy just thinking and talking with people.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.520]   About these types of subjects.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.260]   And I love to teach.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.660]   So I get most.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.480]   I feel really alive when I'm able to see the light bulb go off in somebody's eyes.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   That's why I love doing financial planning.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.040]   Is that when I can explain something to someone in a way that makes sense.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.260]   And I can just teach them about some ideas.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.360]   That they can really see it.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.180]   And I see that light bulb go off in their eyes.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.020]   That just makes all of the impact in the world for me.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.180]   It makes me feel really, really good.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.380]   And it gives me a lot of joy and a lot of gratification.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.120]   So.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.340]   I don't have 10 million bucks.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.620]   But when I look at it.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.720]   And I look at the online world.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   And I see that we are sitting in a day and age.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.940]   Where anybody can teach.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.240]   If they're an expert in something.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   They can build a platform and teach others.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.140]   Some of their knowledge.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.460]   And share some of their knowledge.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.000]   And some of their joy over things.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.280]   And that's what I love to do.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.160]   I love to learn.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.040]   I love to consume.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.760]   I love to just engage and grapple with ideas.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.720]   And so.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.040]   In today's world.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.980]   I see lots of people able to do that.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.560]   And I see lots of people able to do that.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.980]   And earn a little bit of income off of it.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.360]   The vast majority of people who are building and teaching.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.780]   And doing things online.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.420]   Don't make any money off of it.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.420]   And they certainly don't make any kind of living wage.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.780]   But there are some who do.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.640]   And I believe that the people who are the best in the world.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.460]   The best world class teachers.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.760]   Those people are going to be able to establish themselves.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.780]   In a really meaningful way.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.700]   And be able to impact the lives of students.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.200]   I'm so inspired by Salmat Khan.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.120]   With what he did.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.180]   He did at the Khan Academy.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.120]   He just started teaching.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.060]   And now he gets to spend all of his time teaching.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.540]   And he's able to help millions and millions of people.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.300]   All around the world.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.780]   And that can be the same when very, very focused.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.880]   Niche topics.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.040]   Or it can be the same in huge topics.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.540]   I'm so indebted.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.440]   Last night I discovered a new podcast.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.420]   Which I would commend to you.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.800]   Called the Thomas Jefferson Podcast.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.220]   And here's this guy.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.280]   I think he's a college professor.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.400]   I only listened to one episode.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.820]   Or even the first half of an episode.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.340]   He's a college professor.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.700]   Up in Virginia.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.980]   He's an expert on Thomas Jefferson.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.080]   And he's recorded something like a hundred and some odd shows.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.240]   About Thomas Jefferson.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.200]   He has a show on public radio.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.280]   And so it's kind of simulcast on the podcast.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:56.960]   And on the show.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.840]   I listened to 30 minutes of his show.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.060]   And I was just blown away by how much I learned.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.140]   And how much I gained.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.320]   From the life of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.480]   And what he did that made him truly a remarkable man.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.800]   And so I want to do the same thing in the areas of finance.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.380]   I've shared my dream.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.660]   I want to see people.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.780]   I want to get a letter someday.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.800]   From some 18 or 20 year old young man or young woman.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.560]   That says Joshua.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.400]   I discovered your podcast when I was 15 years old.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.840]   And over the last five years.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.900]   With this information that I have received.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.660]   I have been able to transform my life.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.820]   In way A and way B and way C.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.560]   I've been struggling to try to find out.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.660]   What is the theme of the show.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.260]   And the way that I.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.960]   What I really see right now.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.020]   That I'm trying to craft in a little bit better language.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.660]   Is that the theme of this show.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.520]   Is to help you cross the chasm.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.200]   Between your goals.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   And your ideas.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.240]   About your vision of a perfect ideal life.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.060]   And where you are today.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.200]   Because there's a lot of great stuff out there.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.540]   A lot of great inspirational.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.040]   Kind of fluffy goal setting.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.580]   Visioning.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.380]   Idealism.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.660]   Go out and figure out what you want.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.200]   There's a lot of awesome resources that are out there.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.740]   But then you sit and say.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.660]   Here I am.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.400]   I've got to go to work.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.920]   I've got to get in the car and sit in traffic.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.420]   And what do I do about that?
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.820]   There are a series of very specific tangible steps.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.740]   That can occur.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.400]   To take you from here to there.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.320]   But we've got to talk about those steps.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.240]   And the void that I see in the marketplace.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.480]   Is lots of people are talking about the inspirational ideas.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.660]   And that is so valuable.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.100]   To have the inspirational ideas.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.160]   But we need a plan to get from where we are today.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   To there.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.300]   It's inspirational to have the idea of getting out of debt.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.620]   But we need a plan.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.800]   To sit down and say.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.380]   Well how much extra can we pay towards that debt this month.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.840]   In order to get that started.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   So that's what I want this show to do.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.380]   Is to serve as a conduit of great ideas.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.680]   Both the inspiration.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.300]   And the education.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.060]   And the ideas.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.720]   And then the specific tactics and strategies.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.240]   That you can implement into your life.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.940]   To really help you to make progress.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.980]   That's the void that I see.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.200]   The topic that's not being met in the marketplace.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.500]   And so in order to do that.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.320]   We've got to reach people.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.240]   And so with this show.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.400]   I'm just so thrilled.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.240]   Yesterday I mentioned yesterday was a record day.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.900]   And in case you're interested.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.020]   I want to involve you in the show.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.440]   So we've been going now.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.900]   Since I launched on July 1.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.540]   So we're about two weeks in.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.120]   And yesterday we had 600 downloads.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.260]   596 downloads total of the show.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.540]   And now in the world of podcasting.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.520]   I don't actually know.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.700]   What number matters.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.900]   And I know that I have at least one or two listeners.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.320]   And you one or two listeners.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.960]   I'm really thrilled that you're here.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.600]   And the ones that I've heard from.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   The ones that I've corresponded with.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.360]   It just makes me feel really good.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.960]   To know that I can share some ideas and concepts.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.180]   That might be helpful with you.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.100]   But I figure kind of the most meaningful statistic for me.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.320]   With this being a daily show.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.340]   Would be to look at and see how many.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.240]   Downloads are done of a show in one day.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.340]   So right now as of yesterday.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.440]   We released the show yesterday.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   Episode 20 the interview.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   And since yesterday.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.760]   There have been 210 downloads of that show.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.020]   So I figure there's probably.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.340]   You know almost a couple hundred of you.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.440]   Listening to me at this point.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   Maybe a hundred or 150.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.440]   And I just want to say thank you.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   Because the idea to me.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.080]   It's so motivating to think of the idea.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.080]   Of what a hundred or 150 of you.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   Sitting in a room would look like.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.460]   And.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.160]   It's really humbling with the idea.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.820]   That I've got to come up with ideas.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.900]   That are going to really help you.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.000]   So thank you for listening.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.540]   Thank you for those of you.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.760]   Who are helping me spread the message of the show.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.460]   And I want to read next to you.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.380]   I want to just read some.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.220]   Share some iTunes reviews with you.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.080]   By the way.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.580]   Just in case you hear it in the background.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.180]   I'm in Florida.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.220]   And as I record this.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.500]   It's 1 46 p.m.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.540]   And we are having our summer thunderstorm.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.840]   So if you've never been to the subtropics.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.800]   Generally during the summer.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.280]   We have a rainstorm every afternoon.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.080]   Early afternoon.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.200]   And so it's thundering outside the window.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.540]   And so welcome to.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.340]   Welcome to Florida.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.820]   Hope you enjoy your visit.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.160]   Your virtual visit.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.760]   So.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.940]   So the way that we can reach more people.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.540]   And I'm just so thrilled.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.360]   Is.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   To help the show be found.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.340]   And in case you're not familiar with this.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.320]   Only as a podcast listener.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.740]   The most important thing.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.200]   To help the show be found.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.460]   Is reviews.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.260]   Because if you have reviews.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.940]   And down.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.020]   Downloads and reviews.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.360]   If we can generate a certain number of downloads.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.040]   And reviews.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.900]   Then we can start to have people.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.180]   Find the show.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.220]   We'll start to show up in the directories.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.840]   So if somebody searches.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.360]   You know.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:16.840]   Finance.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.760]   Or somebody searches.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.640]   Debt.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.860]   Or someone searches investing.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.940]   Or personal finance.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.240]   Or whatever their search terms are.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.140]   In iTunes.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.680]   Or in pocket casts.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.460]   Or Stitcher.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.220]   Or whatever it is.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.120]   The more.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.980]   The more.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.260]   Reviews that we have.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.120]   The more likely it is.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.780]   That we'll be higher in the search rankings.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.900]   So the biggest help.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.960]   And I just want to say thank you.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.580]   The biggest thing that can be helpful to me.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.200]   Is for you to review the show.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.600]   That really helps people to find us.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.740]   And it helps me hopefully.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.020]   To be able to help more people.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.740]   And for us to really grow this thing together.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.300]   I want this show to serve you.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.440]   So if you have questions.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.120]   If you have topics that you want me to cover.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.660]   I want this show to serve you.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660]   Leading off with.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.000]   I want to.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.480]   We have three reviews on iTunes right now.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.680]   And I just want to say thank you.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.860]   The first one is from the author.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.960]   His name is Stevenomics.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.460]   And this Stevenomics was actually a contributor to the show.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.960]   He asked a question last Friday.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.880]   And he has a website that I want to point you to.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.540]   I was remiss in not pointing you to his website.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.480]   When I answered his question on Friday's Q&A.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.320]   But he said extremely informative.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.960]   The best financial podcast out there.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.980]   So glad he's back on the air.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.120]   Thank you.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.940]   That means the world to me.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.680]   Steve.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.080]   I really, really appreciate that.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.560]   If you're interested.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.020]   I want you to check out his website.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.120]   He has a website called Stevenomics.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.880]   It's S-T-E-V-E-O-N-O-M-I-C-S.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.800]   That he writes.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.580]   And he talks about.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.100]   His tagline is where freedom and fashion meet finance.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.540]   And it's really interesting.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.440]   He actually.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.860]   I found a post.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.440]   And I just tweeted it out last week.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.500]   He has a post on Huffington Post.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.000]   He got an article written and published on Huffington Post.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.920]   Called I spent just a thousand bucks.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.560]   On my wedding.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.200]   Here's how.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.180]   And it's a really neat insight into his life.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.560]   About how he and his wife were able to.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.940]   He and his wife Sally.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.800]   Were able to get married.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.560]   And have a really fun.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.120]   Really ideal wedding for them.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.260]   And do it on a frugal.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.260]   In a frugal way.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.500]   And I feel like.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.180]   That's such an amazing benefit.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.100]   For people when they're getting married.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.080]   And starting off.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.120]   To be able to have the wedding of their dreams.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.660]   Without a huge price tag.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.480]   Another one.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.380]   From Wolf M.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.020]   In Germany.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.240]   So this is on the German iTunes.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.460]   Germany iTunes listing.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.520]   His title says smart.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.860]   He gave us a five star review.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.180]   And he said an awesome.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.520]   Non-dogmatic approach to finance.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.580]   With some real gems.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.600]   Where several layers of efficient concepts.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.280]   Are stacked on top of each other.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.940]   Really good to broaden one's own horizon.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.140]   Daily shows please don't burn out.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.980]   So Wolf.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.320]   Thank you for the review.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.500]   And yes.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.800]   I'm thrilled with the message that I have.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.060]   The non-dogmatic approach is getting out.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.980]   And then the several layers of efficient concepts.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.700]   And you're going to hear.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.260]   As we get into the meat of today's show.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.780]   How I see these concepts working together.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.720]   Where in my mind.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.620]   I think that it is.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.860]   Every bit is valid.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.040]   To compare the cost of.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.760]   Investing in a stock.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.900]   And through your.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.980]   Your retirement plan at work.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.840]   And I don't know.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.300]   How the system works in Germany.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.960]   So forgive me.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   Hopefully there'll be enough ideas here.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.460]   But I see the analysis should be.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.260]   When am I.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.400]   Is it my better serve.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.800]   To invest a hundred dollars.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.060]   Into my retirement plan.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.640]   And buy a publicly traded stock.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.920]   Or am I better spent.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.300]   To invest that hundred dollars.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:13.580]   And buy a full stock.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.440]   Or buy four fruit trees.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.340]   For my front yard.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.580]   That are going to spit out.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.580]   Apples and apricots.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.320]   If you're in Germany.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.360]   Or down here in Florida.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.880]   Mangoes and avocados.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.660]   And things to feed my family.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.800]   And lower my grocery bill.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.640]   As time goes on.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.580]   That's the analysis that's missing.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.260]   And that is a valid analysis.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.940]   And that's the analysis that's missing.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.520]   In the personal finance world.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.640]   You've got to understand.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.600]   And look at these things.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.800]   So I hope that every day.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   I can bring you concepts.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.380]   And when I'm.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.120]   My goal is to bring guests on.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.400]   That are going to challenge you.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.520]   That are going to inspire you.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.000]   With ideas and ways.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.160]   That they've solved.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.460]   Their problems.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.340]   So that you can get exposed.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.580]   And then look at your own life.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:46.840]   And say.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.780]   Well how can I do.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.940]   How can I do this.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.220]   And he said.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.220]   Daily shows.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.000]   Please don't burn out.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.440]   Thank you.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.700]   I'm not going to burn out.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.100]   I think with the.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.700]   I've got some stuff burning inside me.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.020]   I think I could do a thousand shows.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:15:59.820]   On my own.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.400]   No interviews.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.440]   With just some of the concepts.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.620]   That I think would be helpful.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.460]   Without burning out.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.700]   I love doing this.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.620]   And I've got enough.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.260]   Other income.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.100]   And other things to.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.260]   I've got enough other income.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.820]   To fall back on.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.340]   That I can do this.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.140]   For quite a while.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.220]   And I don't plan to go anywhere.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.180]   And my hope is.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.040]   I don't expect anyone.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.900]   To listen to every show.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.780]   But my hope is.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.380]   That this can be.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.080]   A real source of inspiration.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.220]   And education for you.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.680]   Every day.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.520]   And I do hope.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.440]   Over time.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.460]   That the show could.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.680]   Could generate some profit.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.660]   That I would be able to live on.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.660]   And support my family with.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.720]   That is my ultimate hope.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.300]   So.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.880]   But it's clearly.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.120]   Going to take a while.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.500]   To do there.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.200]   So I'm committed.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.340]   To doing a thousand shows.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.340]   No matter what.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.660]   And if after a thousand shows.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.440]   Then.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.820]   Then we'll reconsider.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.180]   But I'm not going to.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:42.860]   I'm not going to quit.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.220]   Before a thousand shows.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.020]   And then the third review.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.980]   Just came in this morning.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.260]   As a four star review.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.080]   From.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.360]   Lisa Gabriela.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.040]   Which.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.420]   She says.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.560]   Help me save money.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.080]   It's so nice.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.140]   To have a lower cell phone bill.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.160]   Than my friends and parents.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.920]   And still have all the same features.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.320]   An interview on this podcast.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.300]   Explained how to choose.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.220]   The best plan for me.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.180]   Twenty five bucks a month.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:01.860]   On a smart phone.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.820]   Yes please.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.560]   So.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.140]   Meat and potatoes.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.880]   Versus.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.680]   Versus.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.660]   Meat and potatoes stuff.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.040]   But man.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.620]   That matters.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.600]   That really does matter.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.760]   On a daily basis.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.520]   So.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.440]   With that.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.980]   I think that's good for.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.320]   For.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.500]   The announcements for today.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.620]   I want to get into the meat of the show.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:16.840]   Oh.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.400]   If you have questions for Friday.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:18.960]   Q and A.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.240]   Email me your questions.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.140]   Tweet me your questions.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.140]   However you want to get a hold of me.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:22.480]   Joshua.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.900]   At Radical Personal Finance dot com.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.560]   On Twitter.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.360]   It's Radical PF.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.960]   And pretty soon here.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.940]   I'll have a voicemail line.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.500]   Set up.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.280]   That you can call in.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.440]   As soon as I can get that done.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.120]   And please.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.900]   If you want to help me.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.520]   Please tell one person about the show.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.200]   And I would just be so thrilled.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   And so grateful.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.440]   If you would.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.940]   Leave a review for me.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.760]   On iTunes.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.560]   And again.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.180]   One star.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.920]   Five stars.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.580]   Doesn't matter.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.020]   Give me your honest feedback.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.180]   And if you have a website.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.140]   Or something like that.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.420]   That you.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.620]   That you wish to disclose.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.440]   Let me know.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.520]   And I'll make sure to.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.920]   To comment on that.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.980]   And share that with the.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.660]   With the audience.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.400]   And I'll be thrilled.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.540]   As we build this thing together.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.760]   Thank you for listening.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.720]   All right.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.760]   Into the meat of today's show.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.400]   Today we're going to talk about.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:00.820]   Stocks.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.320]   And bonds.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:01.900]   And derivatives.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.980]   And basically.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.480]   There are.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.060]   There are three major classes.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.020]   Of financial assets.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.560]   And they're stocks.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:06.840]   Bonds.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.300]   And derivatives.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.860]   And I'm going to.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.620]   Cover mostly today.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.200]   Stocks.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.760]   And bonds.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.880]   This is the important thing.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.460]   Really.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.280]   Because this makes the biggest difference.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:15.740]   On.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.120]   In most people's.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.720]   World.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.180]   Is stocks.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.580]   And bonds.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.020]   Although we do want to cover derivatives.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.600]   Because they are their own.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.880]   Unique.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.500]   Class of financial assets.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.380]   And explain what that word even means.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.800]   You'll see all over the world.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.100]   Or all over the internet.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.820]   Which.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.020]   I guess the internet.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.220]   Is basically the world.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.880]   But you'll see all over the internet.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.960]   Discussion about derivatives.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.480]   And what's going to happen with the.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.840]   How are many trillions of dollars.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.880]   In the derivatives market.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.140]   And I think the average person.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.360]   Would say.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.080]   What on earth is it.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.820]   Is a derivative.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.040]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.240]   In just a moment.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.040]   Before we do that.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.480]   We've got to set the stage.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.340]   And we've got to start.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.540]   With some definition of terms.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.520]   And I'm going to use.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.760]   Primarily a metaphor.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.700]   And an example.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.660]   To build on today.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.720]   And we're going to talk through.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.120]   Basically the construction.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.320]   Of our own little company.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.180]   And we're going to use this.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.720]   To teach.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.500]   How we would do.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.240]   Stocks and bonds.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.740]   And derivatives.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.200]   With our own little company.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.040]   That we're going to start.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.220]   And then you'll understand.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.700]   How these things work together.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.600]   But before we do that.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.180]   We've got to start.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.720]   With the definition of terms.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.420]   So the first term.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:10.960]   That you need to understand.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.460]   Is you need to understand.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.140]   The difference.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.240]   Between real assets.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.740]   And financial assets.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.620]   Real assets.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.660]   And financial assets.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.720]   So ultimately.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.320]   In any society.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.380]   In any economy.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.020]   The material wealth.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.920]   Of that society.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.040]   Is determined.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.000]   By the productivity.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.980]   Of the economy.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.620]   So if you talk to an economist.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.540]   And they're trying to say.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.440]   What is the.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.120]   What are the.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.520]   How well is this economy doing.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.500]   What you're ultimately.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.380]   Trying to measure.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.040]   Is you're ultimately.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.940]   Trying to measure.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.720]   The productivity.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.600]   Of an economy.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.800]   But you're trying.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.040]   To make that measurement.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.300]   Based upon.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.040]   Trying to measure.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.580]   The output.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.320]   The productivity.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.260]   Now that can be measured.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:48.960]   In different ways.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.160]   It may be goods.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.380]   It may be services.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.520]   And so that's where you get.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.740]   Into the gross domestic product.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.880]   The gross national product.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.180]   There are good things.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.620]   About that.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.360]   There are not so great things.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.200]   I have an interesting book.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.260]   On my reading list.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.580]   About the gross domestic product.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.740]   This lady from Britain.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.880]   Wrote an entire book.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.420]   On the GDP.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.380]   And the history of it.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.960]   And how it's.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.660]   In some ways.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.360]   A great measure.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.220]   And in some ways.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.460]   It's incredibly flawed.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.800]   And so the.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.620]   The macro.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.940]   Economists.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.520]   Come together.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:13.960]   And talk.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.520]   Back and forth.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.100]   And try to figure out.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.740]   How do we measure.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.120]   The output of an economy.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.760]   But the output of the economy.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.220]   Is.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.420]   Drives the wealth.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.940]   Okay.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.200]   But.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.260]   The productive capacity.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.400]   Of the economy.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.020]   Is.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.880]   Is a function.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.780]   Of the real.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.040]   Assets of the economy.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.260]   So this would be.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.200]   The land.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.100]   The.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.600]   Natural resources.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.300]   The timber.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.060]   The oil.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.540]   The.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.600]   The farmland.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.720]   The buildings.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   The machines.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.440]   The knowledge.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.880]   All of these things.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.440]   That go into.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:40.920]   Actually.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.540]   The ability.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.460]   To produce.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.520]   Goods.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.000]   And services.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.200]   So.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.140]   Some economies.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.700]   Will have.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.540]   A built-in advantage.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:47.880]   Some.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.920]   Nations.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.060]   Will have a built-in advantage.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.880]   Over other nations.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.340]   One tremendous reason.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.040]   That the United States.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.460]   Of America.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.100]   Has been so.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.100]   Incredibly.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.180]   Economically successful.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.640]   Is because this country.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.500]   Has been incredibly.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.280]   Blessed.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.400]   With tremendous.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   Natural resources.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.020]   If you go back.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.800]   And you read the history.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.280]   And you see.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.060]   The tremendous.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.100]   Natural resources.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.460]   That.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.060]   That.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.460]   The.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.260]   The nation.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.140]   Was blessed with.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.880]   Then that leads to.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.660]   That leads.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.040]   To.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.840]   Ultimately.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.300]   Wealth.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.160]   That is a.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.220]   Valid measure.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.900]   Of wealth.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.740]   Is that.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.720]   The natural resources.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.140]   That is in many ways.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.060]   Real wealth.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.280]   Now.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.140]   What does that mean?
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:21.400]   I mean.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:21.700]   You could.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.820]   I'm not sure.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.460]   How to define it.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:24.740]   More.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.380]   More.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.560]   More.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.860]   Accurately.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.200]   But.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.460]   But.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.200]   Anytime you're talking.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.980]   About real assets.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.400]   You're essentially.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.540]   Talking about real wealth.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.460]   The ability.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.200]   To produce.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.020]   The daily needs.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.480]   Of living.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.380]   So food.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:35.980]   Farmland.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.920]   Would be real wealth.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.860]   Shelter.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.680]   Housing.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.220]   Or building.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.700]   Or lands.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.440]   Would be real wealth.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.500]   And then the ability.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.640]   To have a productive.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.960]   Economic machine.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.880]   So the ability.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.680]   To have a business.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.580]   A business.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.640]   That creates money.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.780]   That would be.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.500]   In my opinion.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.440]   This would be.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.540]   A productive machine.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.400]   And you're into the world.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:52.740]   Of.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.360]   What would be.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.140]   Kind of an offshoot.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.980]   Of a real asset.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.720]   Now.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.220]   On the other hand.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:57.760]   In contrast.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   To real assets.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.040]   You have financial assets.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.780]   So.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.760]   Financial assets.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.580]   Would be an example.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.400]   Stocks and bonds.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.580]   Are financial assets.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.920]   Financial assets.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.080]   Are purely.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.420]   Pieces of paper.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.620]   Or in today's world.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:10.760]   Digital.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.200]   Digital.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.840]   You know.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.260]   Digits.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:12.820]   So.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.320]   The majority of wealth.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.480]   The financial wealth.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.540]   That is held.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.360]   In an economy.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.580]   Is not real.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.000]   At all.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.960]   It's just digits.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.540]   That exist.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.480]   In a computer.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.320]   That's all it is.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.280]   The money.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.860]   Even the pieces of paper.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.360]   That we have.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.560]   People talk about fiat money.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.060]   And all that.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.540]   And it's true.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.300]   You have.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.680]   Federal reserve notes.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.500]   That are paper money.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.240]   But you know what?
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.040]   The vast majority of money.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.180]   Doesn't even exist physically.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.980]   It's not tangible.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.720]   It's an idea.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.940]   And all that is.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.100]   Is a financial assets.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:37.720]   And so.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.680]   The financial assets.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   Do not contribute.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.000]   Directly.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.440]   To the productive capacity.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.260]   Of an economy.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.120]   Rather.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.380]   The financial assets.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.540]   Represent a claim.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.420]   On the productive.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.800]   Assets of an economy.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.360]   So.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.780]   So.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.060]   A financial asset.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.720]   Is a claim.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.080]   To an.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.020]   Into the income.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.820]   That's created.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.560]   From something.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.180]   That's created.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.000]   From the real asset.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.700]   So.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.800]   The example is.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.460]   You know.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.320]   I may not be able.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.020]   To own.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.780]   A.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.280]   An oil refinery.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.660]   Or.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.520]   Or an oil well.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.880]   I may not have the ability.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.060]   To own an oil well.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:10.740]   But.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.140]   I can still buy shares.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.040]   In Exxon Mobil.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.380]   And Exxon Mobil.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:14.880]   Can go.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.140]   And own the real asset.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.720]   And then my financial asset.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.320]   The stock.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.940]   That I own.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.580]   Represents my claim.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.780]   On the income.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.140]   That Exxon Mobil.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:23.800]   Can earn.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.200]   Based upon their.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.340]   Based upon that.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.960]   Based upon their.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.020]   Oil wells production.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.920]   So.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.440]   All wealth.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   And all income.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.680]   Ultimately comes.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.920]   From real assets.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.980]   And the financial assets.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.520]   Just simply.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.540]   Allocate.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.780]   The income.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.500]   Or the wealth.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.560]   Among the investors.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.400]   Among the owners.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   So.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.960]   If you've come in.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.820]   And you've transformed.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.800]   Your human capital.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.440]   Your labor.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.200]   And your time.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.980]   And your skills.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.880]   Into.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.600]   This concept.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.520]   That we call money.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.300]   Which is basically.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   A system of accounting.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.160]   Then you can choose.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.440]   To consume this goodwill.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.040]   That you've bought.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.840]   The system of accounting.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.320]   This money.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.620]   You can choose to consume it today.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.400]   On something.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.960]   Or you can choose.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.840]   To invest it.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.420]   For the future.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.900]   So.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.760]   In this world.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.940]   The only rational way.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.400]   To make that.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:10.840]   Decision.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.560]   Would be to say.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.880]   Do I value.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.360]   The consumption.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.100]   That I can get.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.840]   For today's.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.800]   For today's.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.400]   Expenditure.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.040]   Or do I value.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.420]   The future consumption.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.240]   That I can have.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.600]   With the investment growth.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.020]   So the example here.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.740]   That I come to.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.540]   Comes to mind.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.620]   Is the biblical story.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.620]   Of Jacob and Esau.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.460]   And at the end of Isaac's life.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.080]   If you're not familiar.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.660]   With the account.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.420]   At the end of Isaac.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:31.920]   Isaac was.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.040]   Was the son of Abraham.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   And Jacob and Esau.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.960]   Are the sons of Isaac.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.740]   At the end of.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.620]   Isaac's life.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.680]   Then.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.580]   Or excuse me.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.340]   As part of Jacob and Esau's life.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.060]   Jacob and Esau.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.680]   Were born.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.520]   They were twin brothers.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.120]   And they were.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.440]   At odds with each other.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.900]   They fought.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.460]   All the time.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.820]   So at one point in time.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.360]   Then.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.860]   Esau was out hunting.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.940]   And he had the ability.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.680]   To go out and hunt.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.700]   He was a master woodsman.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.280]   He went out.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.260]   He went out hunting.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.820]   And he came in from a hunt.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.500]   And he was.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.800]   Esau was the firstborn.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.660]   So in that system.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.160]   In Israel.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.000]   The firstborn.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.280]   Was entitled to the larger share.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:01.960]   Of the inheritance.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.680]   It was called a birthright.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.540]   And so.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.660]   Esau came in from hunting.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.400]   And he was incredibly hungry.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.980]   He hadn't eaten.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.480]   I think the hunt.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.360]   Had been unsuccessful.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.140]   If I remember my.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:11.660]   My biblical.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.040]   Stories correctly.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.980]   And Jacob had prepared a soup.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.320]   Or a meal of some kind.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.380]   And Esau said.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.720]   Hey Jacob.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.960]   Can you give me some of the meal?
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.940]   Can I give me some food?
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.780]   And Jacob said.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.120]   Yes.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.140]   I'll give you the food.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.960]   If you give to me your birthright.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.080]   Your claim.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.520]   On the major portion.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.320]   Of the inheritance.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.160]   From our father Isaac's estate.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.720]   And so Esau.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.260]   As the aphorism goes.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.360]   Esau sold his birthright.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.780]   For a bowl of soup.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.820]   So.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.340]   In my terms.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.160]   Esau sold.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.280]   His claim.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.420]   On the future.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.840]   Economic benefit.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.780]   That he would have had.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.820]   By being the firstborn.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.620]   He sold the value.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.880]   Of that future ability.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.520]   To consume.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.660]   For the benefit.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.720]   Of today's consumption.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.760]   He wanted it.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.720]   He wanted the bowl of soup.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.340]   He was hungry.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.460]   He needed some food.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.660]   So this is the.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:57.780]   The.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.640]   Decision.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.460]   That we all face.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.960]   Every day.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.200]   My wife and I.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.740]   Are in the process.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.720]   Of painting our house.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.580]   And so.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.580]   If I go down.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.300]   To the paint store.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.120]   And I buy a $20.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.440]   Can of paint.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.640]   That can of paint.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.160]   Is going to be.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:10.600]   Consumed.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.420]   By being spread.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:11.920]   On the walls.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.600]   Of our living room.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.320]   So once.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:13.980]   As it's spread.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.400]   On the walls.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.000]   Of our living room.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.680]   I no longer have the ability.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.160]   To gain the future income.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.380]   From what that $20.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.260]   Of.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:21.780]   Of.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.520]   Let's say I had bought.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.560]   I had bought.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.780]   Excuse me.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.000]   My English is usually better than that.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.720]   Let's say that I had purchased.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.420]   A.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.460]   One share of a stock.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.160]   Valued at $20.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.600]   And that stock was paying out.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.300]   A $2.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.120]   Dividend.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.300]   Or.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.200]   A $1.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.640]   Dividend.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.680]   It would be a 5% dividend rate.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.160]   So a $1.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.780]   Dividend.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.060]   Each year going forward.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.020]   So I'm giving.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.360]   Up.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.380]   The benefit of a dollar.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.060]   Going forward.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.840]   Into perpetuity.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.360]   And having the value of the stock.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.200]   For the benefit of having a painted living room.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.040]   This is my decision.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.360]   Now.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.040]   I value.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.740]   And she values.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.640]   And we value.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.140]   Having.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.080]   A beautifully painted living room.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.100]   More than I.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.000]   Than we value.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.900]   The money.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.480]   The dollar.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.220]   A year coming in.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.540]   Off of the dividend of this stock.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.200]   So.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.300]   By.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.800]   Putting these things into perspective.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.740]   We can start to see.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.100]   That one of the most important.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.460]   Investment decisions.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.240]   That we can make.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.080]   Is which.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.540]   What of.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.340]   Of our capital.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:09.740]   And of our.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.100]   Of our.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:10.160]   Our.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   Resources.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.200]   That we've built together.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.540]   So we take human capital.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.240]   Work.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.880]   Labor.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880]   Whether that's time.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.480]   Invested.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.000]   Skills.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.680]   Knowledge.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.020]   Skills.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.520]   And abilities.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.060]   We take this human capital.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.580]   This ability to be productive.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.880]   That we as humans have.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.180]   And that human capital.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.340]   Is usually turned into some form of financial capital.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.420]   We call it money.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.460]   A system of accounting.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.340]   Among us.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.480]   That's all money is.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.640]   Is a representative concept.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.820]   Of a system of accounting.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.820]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.920]   Whether it's U.S. dollars.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.600]   Or.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:35.720]   Or.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.740]   Euros.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.940]   Or gold coins.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:38.960]   Or seashells.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.440]   Or.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.080]   Bitcoin.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.900]   Or whatever.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.140]   The system is.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.420]   Money is just a system of accounting.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.220]   And so.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.480]   We take that system of accounting.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.340]   That we now have.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.360]   And we say.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.040]   I'm going to choose to do.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.320]   This.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.040]   With the money.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:51.760]   Now.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.500]   If we're broke.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.740]   And we don't have any.
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.040]   Any.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.280]   If we don't have any food.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.240]   Let's say that we live in an impoverished area of the world.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:57.860]   And we.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.260]   We're.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.800]   We're earning just enough to pay our.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.240]   Our daily.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.600]   Our.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.820]   Just enough money.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.000]   To hopefully buy some food.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.160]   I'm in close.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.680]   We have some.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.560]   I have some friends in.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.040]   In parts of Africa.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.980]   Where they're in this situation.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.620]   Every day.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.060]   Not knowing where today's.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.000]   Food is going to be.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.140]   And there's been crop failures.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.960]   And crop shortages.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.800]   And.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.280]   They're.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.200]   They don't have.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.380]   Any ability to get today's food.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.380]   Or to know exactly where it's going to come from.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.120]   And so.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.840]   In that world.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.020]   The rational thing to do.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.760]   Is to buy food.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.400]   Because we've got to survive till tomorrow.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.240]   And if we don't have food.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.400]   For enough consecutive days.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.600]   We're going to have a very difficult time.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.900]   So we're forced to consume it.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.800]   But when we can generate a surplus.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.120]   Over and above what we need.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.020]   For that daily need.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.040]   Then we can decide.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.120]   What do I do with the surplus?
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.640]   And so the.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.680]   One of the decisions is.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.880]   Are we going to buy.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.780]   Real assets.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.100]   Or are we going to buy.
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.180]   Financial assets.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.360]   So real asset.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   Are we going to buy a house.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:45.900]   To live in.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.380]   So that we.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.120]   So to shelter us.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.400]   Are we going to purchase.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.460]   Farmland.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.660]   So that we can produce crops.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.380]   Are we going to purchase.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.800]   A timber.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.620]   Attractive timber.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.760]   With trees on it.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.820]   So that we can sell the timber.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.360]   Are we going to start a business.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.660]   Or are we going to purchase.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.700]   Financial assets.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.820]   And lay claim.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.480]   On some other aspect of income.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.780]   So real assets.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.720]   Ultimately drive.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.180]   All economic growth.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.120]   But yet.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.000]   We're mostly used to looking at.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.700]   Financial assets.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.960]   Now the key is.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.620]   If you were to look at.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.580]   A payment of accounts.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.080]   If you were to look at.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.840]   A balance sheet.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.080]   For something like.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.700]   U.S. households.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.180]   Or a country.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.340]   Or an individual.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:20.980]   If you were to look at.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.780]   A balance sheet.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.120]   You would see listed.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.180]   A differentiation.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.920]   Between the real assets.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.960]   And the financial assets.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.120]   So the real assets.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.100]   Would be the real estate.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.980]   Would be the factories.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.260]   Would be these types.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.420]   Of things that we've gone over.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.620]   Probably too much.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.680]   And the financial assets.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.820]   Would be stocks.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.620]   Bonds.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.420]   Cash.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.600]   Mutual funds.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.080]   Debts.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.840]   That are outstanding.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.320]   Life insurance.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.200]   Cash value reserves.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.080]   Pension reserves.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.020]   These types of things.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.460]   But the key thing to remember.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.020]   Is that all of those financial assets.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.460]   Are financial assets.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.160]   Of households.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.000]   But they're liabilities.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.340]   Of the issuer.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.040]   Of the security.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:55.980]   So let's say.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.060]   That you have a hundred dollars.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.880]   And you bring it to me.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.200]   And you say.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.620]   Joshua.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.220]   I'm going to invest a hundred dollars.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.160]   In the bank of Joshua.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.600]   So as a bank.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.780]   I would then say.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.100]   I'm going to issue you.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.080]   Let's assume.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.920]   That I'm going to issue you.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.080]   A piece of debt secured.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.020]   I'm going to issue you a bond.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.500]   Which will get to.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:09.980]   In just a moment.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.360]   So I'm going to issue you back.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.480]   A hundred dollar bond.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.440]   And I'm going to promise.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.080]   To pay you.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.940]   Five dollars of interest payments.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.300]   Every single year.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.400]   For the next five years.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.380]   And at the end of five years.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.740]   I'll return your hundred dollar.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.140]   I'll return your hundred dollars.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.560]   To you.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.180]   So you now have an asset.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.360]   On your balance sheet.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.980]   That is called.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.860]   A hundred dollar bond.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.560]   From.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:27.980]   You know.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.440]   An IOU.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.200]   From Joshua.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.720]   And I now have a liability.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.880]   On my balance sheet.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.740]   So I owe you a hundred dollars.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.220]   So if we were to look at this.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:35.840]   In aggregate.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.780]   Over a nation.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.800]   Or over a community.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.680]   Or over the world.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.260]   In aggregate.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.300]   What we would find.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.680]   Is that all of the financial assets.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.880]   Will ultimately cancel out.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.340]   Because every financial asset.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.720]   Is an asset for one entity.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.480]   And it's a liability.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.380]   For the other entity.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.640]   So the financial asset.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.840]   Would cancel out.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.920]   And then we're ultimately.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.380]   Only left with the real assets.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.680]   So all.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.140]   Whether it's.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:55.780]   We're talking about.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.380]   A community.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.360]   Or a nation.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.260]   Wealth.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.520]   Is.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.920]   Only consists.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.580]   Of the real assets.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.240]   The structures.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.840]   The equipment.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.660]   The inventory.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.860]   Of products.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.460]   The land.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.320]   These types of things.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.260]   That are real assets.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:07.940]   Now.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.780]   In financial planning.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.200]   We almost.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.320]   Exclusively focus.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.500]   On financial assets.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.720]   So we almost.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.700]   Exclusively are talking.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.420]   About money.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.660]   About financial assets.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.500]   But we really.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.320]   Shouldn't start there.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.520]   We really should.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.360]   Really incorporate.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.720]   Into our conversations.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.740]   An accounting.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.980]   Of real assets.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.040]   And financial assets.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.880]   Because sometimes.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.660]   You can substitute.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.380]   The two of them.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.980]   So.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.740]   As I mentioned.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.380]   In the introduction.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:28.960]   I believe.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.660]   That a rational.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.880]   Decision.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.640]   I love avocados.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.900]   It's one of my favorite.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.100]   One of our favorite fruits.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.560]   That we have.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.460]   And we grow them well.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.200]   Down here in Florida.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.600]   We don't have the dark ones.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.460]   That they have out in California.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.060]   We don't have the.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.340]   Hossa.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   Avocados.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.580]   We have Florida.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.020]   Avocados.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.980]   And there's many varieties.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.240]   Well.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.120]   I'm planning to go.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.320]   And buy some avocado trees.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Avocados are expensive.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:46.800]   Down here.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.360]   Even though.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.340]   Because what happens.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:48.980]   They ship them in.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.660]   From California.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.540]   Or New Zealand.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.340]   Or other places.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.580]   And they're expensive.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.280]   So.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.820]   When my wife goes to the store.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.840]   And brings home.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.240]   A bag of avocados.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.820]   For us to eat.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.440]   That is.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:58.860]   It's not.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.460]   They're not cheap.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.580]   I don't remember the exact price.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.640]   They fluctuate with the season.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.380]   But they're not cheap.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.480]   So I can go.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.860]   And I can buy an avocado tree.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.360]   For say 25 bucks.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.060]   So I plan.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.960]   In the next couple of months.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.180]   I need.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.620]   I need to plant some avocado trees.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.440]   So I'm going to go.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.680]   And plant some avocado trees.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.340]   And for a $25 tree.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.100]   If I buy a $25 tree.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.120]   And I plant it well.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.380]   And I care for it well.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.120]   A good.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.420]   Mature avocado tree.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.400]   That's 5 to 8.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.300]   10 years old.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.240]   Is going to produce.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.220]   Hundreds of pounds.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.420]   Of avocados for me.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.880]   In any.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.900]   Kind of growing season.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.060]   And what I plan to do.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.160]   Is instead of planting one tree.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.960]   Which just.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.640]   Puts forth a torrent.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.720]   Of avocados.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.260]   That I can't eat them all.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:34.940]   In one.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.040]   In one season.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   Where you're just sick.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.220]   And tired of eating avocados.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:38.500]   Morning.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:38.680]   Noon.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:38.960]   And night.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.100]   I plan to plant.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.240]   Maybe four.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.260]   Four or five trees.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.740]   That ripen throughout the year.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.820]   So I may have one crop.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.160]   On one variety.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.180]   That ripens in March.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.780]   Another crop.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.440]   On another variety.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.360]   That comes in July.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.620]   Another one in September.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.100]   And the fourth one in December.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.060]   And I plan to keep these trees small.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.280]   So that I can allocate.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.560]   More of my property.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.800]   Which the small.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.920]   Limited amount of space.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.580]   That I have.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.860]   Keep these trees small.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.180]   So I can fit four trees in.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.220]   Instead of one big tree.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.600]   And have a smaller harvest.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.880]   That spread over a period of time.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.060]   So to me.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.180]   To me.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.040]   Spending $100.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.600]   On four avocado trees.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.920]   Is exactly.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.860]   And should be part of.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.900]   The investment decision.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.300]   As should I put $100.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.400]   Into my.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:15.780]   You know.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.240]   Cash value life insurance policy.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.380]   Or should I put $100.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.160]   Into.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.420]   Apple stock.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.040]   Or.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.960]   I'm always going to use.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.900]   Apple stock as the example.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.920]   I don't own any apple stock.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.900]   But it's going to be the example.
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.540]   Because I think it's still.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.880]   The largest cap stock.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.280]   On Wall Street.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.460]   If my memory is correct.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.100]   So.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.300]   So this.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.380]   This should be every bit.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.280]   Of a rational decision.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   I would believe.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:34.960]   Under the scenario.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.620]   That I've given you.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.040]   If I can buy a 25.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.920]   Dollar fruit tree.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.740]   And.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.580]   It's not going to produce.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.260]   Much for me.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.200]   In the first couple of years.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:41.640]   But then.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.120]   This tree may have a lifespan.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.100]   Of I don't know.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.780]   20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:46.660]   I don't know how long.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.580]   Avocado trees live.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.320]   And I'm going to get.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.360]   Hundreds of pounds of fruit.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.340]   And I know that.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.340]   Avocados are usually.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.360]   A couple bucks of fruit.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.900]   At the local fruit stand.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.680]   That is a huge.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.040]   Return on investment.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.460]   And that's probably.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.220]   Better for me.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.120]   To focus on buying.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.100]   That real asset.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.200]   The avocado tree.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.240]   At the beginning of my life.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.100]   If my family likes.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:04.680]   Avocados.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.600]   Then for me.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.980]   To buy the financial asset.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.880]   That's going to give me.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.860]   A certain amount of return.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.200]   Me lending money.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.280]   On a general electric.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.900]   Bond.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.620]   Or to lending money.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.340]   To the U.S. government.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.580]   On a U.S. savings bond.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.540]   Where they're going to pay me.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   2.8 percent.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.320]   Interest.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.540]   That does nothing.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.620]   For my financial life.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.840]   So I'm not going to do it.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.780]   My going down.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.320]   And buying.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.540]   An avocado tree.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.600]   For 25 bucks.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.060]   Allows me in the future.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.340]   To free up that.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.660]   Maybe $10 a month.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.900]   That I might spend on avocados.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.900]   Or $5 a month.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.960]   That I might spend on avocados.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.600]   Into.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.060]   The equivalent of basically.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.680]   Perpetuity.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.340]   And the wonderful thing about that.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.000]   Is those avocados.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:37.760]   Are not taxed.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.040]   So now I can avoid the taxes.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.680]   I can avoid the sales tax.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.120]   I guess avocados aren't.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.360]   Or their food.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.420]   So they're not going to be sales tax.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.860]   So I guess my example breaks down.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.500]   But I got excited.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.800]   But I can avoid the tax.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.780]   And all of that gain.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.480]   That's never taxed.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.000]   So all the gain of the income.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.600]   So okay.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.480]   So that would be the example.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.120]   Is that.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.080]   I could on the one hand.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.300]   Let's say I spend $10 a month.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.940]   On avocados.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.960]   I could go down.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.660]   And every month.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.280]   I'd have to earn.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.820]   If I'm at a 20% effective rate.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.600]   $12.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.480]   To get my $10.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.360]   That I can spend my after tax money.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.020]   On avocados.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.060]   Or I could just plant the avocado tree.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.680]   And to me.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.860]   That makes all the sense in the world.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.960]   Now if I'm renting.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.680]   In a small apartment.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   If I'm living in Hong Kong.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.140]   Or Singapore.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.900]   It's likely that I'm not going to be able.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.540]   To make that scenario.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.900]   But isn't that an intelligent way.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.480]   To look at it.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.140]   I mean.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.120]   Not to pat myself on the back.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.320]   It just.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.220]   It makes sense to me.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.520]   And so I feel.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:25.980]   As though.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.140]   It's smarter for me.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.680]   Right now.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.100]   To go and buy four avocado trees.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.140]   And eight mango trees.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.080]   And 16.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.580]   You know.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.140]   Well that's too many.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.420]   Four orange trees.
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.260]   And some grapefruit.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.120]   And some kiwi.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.320]   And some blueberries.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.800]   And really.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.140]   Develop my property.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.260]   To provide food for me.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:39.940]   And plant a garden.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.700]   My wife and I.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.100]   Had this amazing tomato harvest.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.700]   From our garden.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.580]   It's so easy.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.440]   You buy a packet of seeds.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.280]   You stick them in the ground.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.260]   The tomato plants grow.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.980]   In Florida.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.440]   They die when the summertime comes.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.900]   So they're all dying out there.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.000]   But no big deal.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.880]   It cost us a dollar.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.300]   And we've.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.480]   We've reaped bowls.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.100]   And bowls.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.300]   Of little cherry tomatoes.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.120]   That.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.600]   And those things.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.780]   If you go down to Publix.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.000]   And get the package.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   Of cherry tomatoes.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.540]   They're a couple bucks.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.940]   So that's a real.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.100]   Wonderful investment.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.440]   And then the wonderful thing.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.300]   About the cherry tomatoes.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.700]   Is that.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.880]   If they're not a hybrid variety.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.600]   Or the avocados.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.340]   Is that.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.080]   They reap dividends.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.400]   And I can reinvest those dividends.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.840]   I can take an avocado off the tree.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.720]   And if it's not a hybrid.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.120]   Or if it's not grafted.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.840]   I can go ahead.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.980]   And I can just stick it in the ground.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.840]   It'll grow again.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   It'll grow me another tree.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.720]   And I can take.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.940]   And I can sell those avocados.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.280]   And I can sell to my neighbors.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:23.700]   And friends.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.220]   A bag of avocados.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.040]   This is rational economic thought.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.000]   Now.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.900]   We could start an avocado plantation.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.160]   And if we were going to do that.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.640]   I might need more than $25.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.220]   And so that might be where.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.280]   We would get into the financial.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:36.800]   Assets.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.980]   So we're going there now.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.320]   But remember that we're.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.080]   Never lose sight of the fact.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.820]   That the value of financial assets.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.420]   And the success or failure.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.680]   Of those financial assets.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.500]   Is ultimately dependent.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.740]   On the underlying performance.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.480]   Of the real asset.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.180]   That is backing the financial asset.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.660]   So if you invest in my avocado plantation.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.580]   And I go and I buy a hundred trees.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.360]   And then I lose 50 of them.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.940]   To a freeze or to a bug.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.700]   That is going to really impact.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.260]   The profitability of my avocado plantation.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.740]   And the profitability of your financial asset.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.280]   So we need to really.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.400]   Always remember that.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.400]   The financial assets are tied.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.540]   To the real assets.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.600]   Real assets generate income.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.920]   Financial assets allocate that income.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.560]   Now.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.340]   In general.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.360]   We're going to distinguish between.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.060]   Basically three broad types of financial assets.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.760]   Those three broad types.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.280]   Are called different names.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.500]   But you'll hear these always used interchangeably.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.320]   They're essentially fixed income.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.940]   Equity.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.480]   And derivatives.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.240]   Fixed income.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.120]   Equity.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.000]   And derivatives.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.260]   So fixed income.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.420]   Would be also.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.420]   You'll also hear it referred to as a debt security.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.340]   Or a bond.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.820]   These are all the same things.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.020]   Equities.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.800]   Also referred to as stocks.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.160]   Equities are shares of ownership.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   You would have equity.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.060]   Or value of ownership.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:51.640]   Or ownership.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.580]   In a company.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.880]   And then derivatives.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.780]   And a derivative is something that derives its value.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.360]   From the performance of something else.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.260]   So let's talk through these.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.900]   And I'm going to explain these terms.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.540]   In a way that I hope makes sense to you.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:06.700]   But.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.920]   And then we're going to talk through.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.360]   A practical example.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.020]   Of how to use these.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.140]   How a business would develop.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.820]   And use these instruments.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.040]   So fixed income is in many ways.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.720]   The simplest.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.220]   They're all simple.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.760]   Fixed income is a simple type of investment.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.400]   To understand.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.400]   And so essentially a bond.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.920]   A bond is basically.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.260]   It's debt.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.880]   It's lending money to a company.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.140]   So the example here would be.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.360]   If you were going to come to me.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.480]   And you were going to say.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.220]   Joshua.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.340]   I need money.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.160]   I said okay.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.740]   How much do you need?
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.380]   I need $100.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.800]   All right.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.680]   I'll give you the $100.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.120]   And I'll lend it to you.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.620]   But I'm not going to give you the $100.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.400]   That I could spend on my consumption.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.300]   Unless you can give me.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.420]   Some additional benefit.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.600]   That I can't get by consuming the money myself.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.380]   So you say well I'll pay you.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.920]   Instead of when I bring it back.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.940]   Instead of paying you $100.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.220]   I'll pay you $105.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.420]   And I'll return it to you.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.380]   A year from now.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.120]   So we're all familiar.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:06.920]   With the idea of a loan.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.960]   You have an interest rate.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.280]   I say that would be good.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.700]   I would value more.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.740]   Having $105 in one year.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.160]   I would value that more.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.800]   Than having the $100 to use today.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.240]   So therefore I'll give you my $100.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.560]   And you can use it for a year.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.320]   This is the simple concept of debt.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.360]   That's what a bond is.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.440]   Except in general.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.960]   It's not usually just one year.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.880]   Although it could be.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   More typically when we think of bonds.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.540]   We think about it as something like this.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.240]   I'm going to lend you my $100.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.300]   You're going to pay me $5 every year.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.500]   For the next five years.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.160]   And then at the end of five years.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.620]   You're going to give me back my $100.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.020]   So in that bond.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.240]   I'm going to lend you the $100.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.440]   I'm going to get my $5.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.220]   So that would be if I were to lend to a company.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.940]   Or if I were to lend to a government.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.360]   Now your ability to make good.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.500]   On those payments.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.640]   Those $5 annual payments to me.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.720]   Your ability to make good on those payments.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.500]   Is very much dependent on.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.800]   Whether you have the money or not.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.680]   So the performance of a bond.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.240]   Is very closely tied.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.420]   To the financial condition of the borrower.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.140]   Or in bond terms.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.120]   This is called the issuer.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.280]   Who issues the bond.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.600]   So in our example of the $100 and the $5.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.360]   You would issue me a $100 bond.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.800]   With what's called a $5 coupon payment.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.860]   And the coupon payment.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.460]   Refers to in old days.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.920]   They would send a book of coupons.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   That you would use.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.520]   To lay claim on your interest payments.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.100]   And so it's called a coupon payment.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.020]   A 5% coupon payment.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.060]   That gets paid based upon the $100 security.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.120]   So you create the security.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.060]   You create the financial asset.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.180]   And that financial asset is backed.
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.400]   Based upon your ability.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.560]   To make the payments to me.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.200]   Now there are vast.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.000]   Vast.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.340]   A vast array of different ways.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.480]   That these types of bonds.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.060]   That bonds could be structured.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.300]   That they could be securitized.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.520]   That they could be issued.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.700]   They can be.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.240]   They can be on fixed interest rate payments.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.900]   Where we're going to pay you 5% per year.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.900]   They could be based on floating interest rates.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.320]   So for example.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.940]   If I were a corporation.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:14.060]   I could borrow money for you at 1.8% above the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bills.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.660]   So the government has its borrowing rate.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.700]   Let's say that's 2%.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.660]   And I'm going to pay you 1.8% on top of that.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.320]   So that would be 3.8%.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.020]   So then I could adjust every year.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.300]   So those.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   But the reason that it's called a fixed income investment.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.120]   Is that you know.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.240]   How much your payment is going to be.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.200]   If it's a 5% fixed interest rate.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.080]   A 5% fixed interest rate.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.780]   A 5% fixed coupon rate.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.940]   Then you know every year you're getting 5 bucks.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.860]   Or if it's determined by a formula.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.840]   You know all you got to do.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.900]   Pull up and open the newspaper.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.620]   See what U.S.T. bills are paying.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.980]   Add 1.8%.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.520]   You know that on December 31st.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.820]   When my bond payment is due.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.340]   Then you're going to receive.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:52.960]   In my example.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.780]   $3.80.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.620]   So it's a fixed income.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.620]   And so it's.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.800]   But it's.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.740]   My ability to pay is purely determined.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.680]   Based upon.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.100]   If I'm the issuer of the bond.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.340]   My ability to pay is based upon my financial state.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.060]   There can be short term bonds.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:06.880]   Long term bonds.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.960]   So if you're the U.S. government.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.880]   And you're borrowing money.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.880]   You issue treasury bills.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.660]   Notes and treasury bonds.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.320]   So treasury bills are short term.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.440]   Notes are intermediate term.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.320]   Bonds are long term.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.180]   If you are a local municipality.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.780]   You could issue short term.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.780]   You could issue long term.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.460]   If you're a company.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.180]   You could issue very short term.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.880]   You could issue.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.780]   You could issue very short term or long term.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.040]   I won't go into more details.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.780]   But right now.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.680]   This could be.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.960]   Across the board.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.080]   And they can be risky.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.880]   Or they can be very very safe.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.320]   So the U.S. government bonds.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.480]   That the U.S. government issues.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.800]   Are generally considered to be the safest.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.180]   That they could possibly be.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.080]   And there's zero risk of default.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.060]   By investing in U.S. government bonds.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.340]   And the reason that there's zero risk of default.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.820]   Is because the U.S. government has.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.060]   The legal ability.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.760]   And the legal authority to tax people.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.440]   So the U.S. government will always be able.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.840]   To make payments on.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.660]   Bonds.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.760]   As long as they retain the ability.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.500]   To tax the income from people.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.420]   To ensure that those payments are made.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.780]   Many of you are immediately thinking.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.120]   What about the value of those payments?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.080]   That's another issue.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.260]   Show for another time.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.920]   U.S. issued securities.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.860]   Have zero risk of default.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.060]   Because the government can tax the people.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.820]   Now if the government lost the ability.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.560]   To tax the people.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.500]   So in the United States.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.160]   In the Civil War.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.100]   What would happen when the Confederate.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   Government in the southern states.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.000]   Issues its bonds.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.700]   And it promises to pay people back.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.120]   The money in exchange for them.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.000]   Giving it to the government.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.100]   Well the government loses the war.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.060]   Government goes bankrupt.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.160]   The bonds become worthless.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.580]   That'd be an interesting piece.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.740]   I made that up off the top of my head.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.720]   Because I believe it's true.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.540]   If anyone knows.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.900]   I'd be interested in reading a book about that.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.100]   If anyone knows of any books.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.020]   Or any information on that.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.660]   I'll have to research that later.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.880]   But so if the government loses the ability to tax.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.540]   My point is that if the government loses.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.420]   Its ability to tax the people.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.040]   Then it loses its ability.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.680]   To make those payments.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.300]   On its debts.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:10.000]   That's debt securities.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.540]   That's fixed income securities.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.080]   Now the second type of assets.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.160]   Are called equities.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.260]   Or stock.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.680]   So equity.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.800]   A stock represents.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.960]   It's a financial asset.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.360]   That represents an ownership claim.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.320]   So instead of it representing.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.120]   A debt claim.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.340]   A crediting claim to a company.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.920]   Equity represents an ownership claim.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.060]   And so a bondholder.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.280]   Is promised a stock.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.380]   At a certain payment rate.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.780]   That's why it's called fixed income.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.680]   An equity holder is not promised.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.080]   Any particular payment.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.240]   So there's no specific amount.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.280]   That an equity holder can be promised.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.400]   So this is why.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.600]   If you own stock in a company.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.400]   You really never know.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.200]   How much you're going to get for your asset.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.800]   You really never know how much.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.520]   For example if your company is paying a dividend.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.400]   And a dividend is a share of the profits.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.000]   That are returned to the owners of the company.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.840]   If your company is paying a dividend.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.920]   You never know from quarter to quarter.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.440]   If the dividends are declared quarterly.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.860]   How much your dividends are going to be.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.880]   Now some companies are very consistent.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.040]   Some companies are not.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.060]   And a company may increase those dividends.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.440]   Or may decrease the dividends.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.360]   Depending on what's going on in the individual business.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.520]   But you're not necessarily promised any specific amount.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.660]   You get the dividends that the firm pays.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.600]   And you have a portion of.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.280]   You have an allocated percentage of ownership.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.600]   In the assets.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.020]   In the real assets of the company.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.980]   So if you and I are going to go.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.060]   Into an opportunity.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.400]   An avocado plantation together.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.580]   And we decide to make you an equity holder.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.600]   Let's assume that you invest $100.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.040]   And I invest $100.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.120]   And you own 50% of the stock.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.460]   And I own 50% of the stock.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.120]   And we buy 10 trees.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.460]   Well you own 50% of the value of those trees.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.780]   So if we need to split up.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.700]   We can sell the trees on the secondary market.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:00.360]   And we can split our money.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.400]   So we can share our money between us.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.960]   And so hopefully.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.160]   My example is not a very good one.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.180]   With the avocado plantation.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.480]   Because it's kind of hard to dig a tree up without killing it.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.080]   But it is theoretically possible.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.440]   So the performance of.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.200]   Equity investments.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.520]   Is directly tied to the success of the firm.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.120]   And directly tied to the performance of its real assets.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.360]   So because of this.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.240]   You'll have a lot more.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.360]   Volatility.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.660]   A lot more fluctuations.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.540]   In the price of.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.140]   Equity securities.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.000]   Than you would have.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.800]   Than you will have.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.900]   In debt securities.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.940]   Because debts.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.660]   Because those payments are promised.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.840]   At a certain time.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.640]   At a certain amount.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.600]   It's a little bit more consistent.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.860]   But because the equity payments are not promised.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:46.600]   At a certain time.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.840]   At a certain amount.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.760]   Then there may be more variability.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.920]   In the amounts of payments.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.140]   That are paid to the person.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.360]   Who owns the financial asset.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.520]   Now there are other advantages.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.540]   And disadvantages of it.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.600]   So in.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.640]   For example.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.860]   If the company were to go bankrupt.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.520]   Bondholders come ahead.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.000]   So creditors to the company.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.900]   The bondholders.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.920]   Come ahead of the owners of the company.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.800]   This would be normal.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.720]   If you owned a company.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.640]   And you had debts that you had to pay.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.740]   And you had to close your doors.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.020]   Then you would pay.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.440]   Paying those debts first.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.980]   If there was any money.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.360]   You sold all your assets in the company.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.420]   You'd be paying those debts first.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.060]   To.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.920]   To your creditors.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.360]   Before you would be taking.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.400]   Whatever was left over.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.060]   For yourself.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.720]   To have in your own.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.580]   Your own money.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.500]   So.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.600]   Hopefully that's a good background.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.800]   On fixed income.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.680]   And debt securities.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.920]   The third type of.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.620]   Financial asset.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.420]   That is a primary.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.920]   A primary type of financial asset.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.640]   Is called a derivative.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.760]   And so.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.480]   A derivative security.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.860]   Is a financial asset.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.820]   That derives its value.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.420]   Based upon the underlying performance.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.100]   Of another financial asset.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.980]   So you might hear.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.240]   The words options.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.080]   Or futures contracts.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.980]   And so.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.800]   There are many types of derivatives.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.300]   But options or futures contracts.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   Would be the specific.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.960]   The specific amounts.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.680]   So.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.780]   And we'll talk.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.320]   In detail.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:05.880]   Another time.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.500]   About options.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.300]   And futures.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:07.560]   But.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.620]   You could do.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.500]   You could purchase.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.260]   Something called a call option.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:11.840]   On a stock.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.720]   And so.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.980]   If you purchased a call option.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.560]   On a stock.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.860]   You would pay money.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   To somebody.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.060]   That would.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.520]   And that.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.260]   Payment that you would make.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.460]   Would allow you to buy the stock.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.940]   As long as a certain.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.300]   A certain thing.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.100]   Turned out to be.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.140]   Turned out to be true.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.380]   So let's say that.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.260]   Under a call option.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.560]   Let's say that you're going to buy.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.780]   One share.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.300]   Of.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:34.700]   Of.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.500]   Of XYZ corporation stock.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.920]   And.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.540]   You have the option to buy it.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.120]   For.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.820]   Say.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.940]   Thirty dollars per share.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.480]   You're going to pay.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.360]   You're going to pay.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:46.740]   The.
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.460]   The.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.060]   Your.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:48.980]   Trading partner.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.000]   In the derivatives world.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:50.680]   You're going to pay.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.600]   That person.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.240]   Say.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:52.920]   Two dollars.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.620]   For the option to buy the stock.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.620]   At thirty dollars per share.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.220]   Now.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.200]   And.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.720]   There's a.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.080]   Certain time period.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.980]   That's applied to that.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:01.660]   So let's say that.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.100]   Anytime within the next.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.900]   Six months.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.500]   So.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.000]   Let's say you buy.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.260]   A six month call option.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.620]   On.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.560]   XYZ corporate.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.460]   Thirty dollars a share.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.120]   What you are hoping.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.260]   Is that.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:11.620]   The.
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.200]   That.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:12.500]   The.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.220]   And you paid.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.120]   Two dollars for it.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:14.320]   If my.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.120]   In my example.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.200]   What you're hoping.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.440]   Is that the value of that stock.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.880]   The market value.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.460]   The market price of that stock.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.640]   Will increase.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.280]   Higher than thirty dollars.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.140]   So if.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.180]   Six months from now.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.600]   The market price of that stock.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.980]   Is currently at forty dollars.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.340]   Then what you would do.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.260]   Is you would go ahead.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:31.900]   And do what's called.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.200]   Exercise the option.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.300]   You would go ahead.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.340]   And pay me.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:35.960]   Thirty dollars.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.620]   For the stock.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.820]   And then you would turn around.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.720]   And you could turn around.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.220]   And sell it.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.000]   At forty dollars.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.980]   So.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.160]   What you've effectively.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.180]   Been able to do.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.620]   Is you've been able to control.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.040]   The thirty dollars.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.880]   Worth of stock.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.020]   For an outlay.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.660]   Out of pocket.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:50.460]   Of two dollars.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.280]   And the value.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.340]   Of that control.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.200]   Is what drives.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.740]   The value.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.520]   Of your security.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.440]   So if.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.180]   In my example.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.060]   If the market price.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.560]   Of the stock.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.700]   Goes up to forty dollars.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.680]   And you are.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:01.880]   Have.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.040]   You have had the ability.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.300]   To buy.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:04.680]   The stock.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.200]   For thirty.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.440]   Plus your two dollar.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.680]   Cost of buying the option.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.380]   And then you turn around.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:08.840]   And sell it.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.460]   You've profited eight dollars.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.280]   So that's a.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.420]   That's a profit.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.340]   For your six months.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:13.560]   Of.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.680]   For your six months.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.620]   But.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.640]   If the market price.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.180]   Of the stock.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.300]   In the open market.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.840]   Is twenty five dollars.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.900]   Then what happens.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.600]   Is your option.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.440]   Becomes worthless.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.780]   It's worthless.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.260]   Because.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:25.760]   You would have no reason.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.800]   To go.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.860]   And pay thirty dollars.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.200]   To exercise the option.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.060]   To buy the stock.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.400]   When you can just go around.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.420]   And pay twenty five bucks.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.400]   Because now you're.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:33.740]   You're.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.180]   If you were.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.180]   You were all in.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.400]   You still wanted to buy the stock.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.780]   You're essentially paying.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.480]   Thirty two dollars.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:38.980]   For the stock.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.620]   When you could buy it.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.320]   Twenty five bucks.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:40.880]   The two dollars.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.540]   For the insurance.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.160]   Or excuse me.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.380]   For the.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.280]   For the option price.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.060]   Plus the.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.220]   Twenty.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.860]   Plus the thirty dollars.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.200]   For the.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.540]   For exercising the option.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.320]   So.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.280]   The derivative.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.820]   The value of that security.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.580]   Is going to be derived.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.480]   Based upon the underlying performance.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.120]   Of XYZ corporation stock.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.840]   The derivatives will go.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.840]   All over the place.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.240]   And as far as their value.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:04.780]   But the key thing.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.320]   Is to notice.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.180]   That they can be.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.400]   Hugely valuable.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.680]   Or they can be worthless.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.840]   If you had.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.260]   The.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.660]   If you had a call option.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.420]   On XYZ corp.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.120]   And if that call option.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.140]   If.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.180]   And you could buy it.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:17.880]   Thirty bucks.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.480]   And you paid two dollars for it.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:20.040]   And let's say.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.580]   That XYZ corporation.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.280]   Invented the.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.820]   Guaranteed cure for cancer.
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.340]   And they are set to make.
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:26.040]   Billions.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.360]   And so the market price.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:27.860]   Of the stock.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.280]   Increases to a hundred dollars.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.100]   Or two hundred dollars.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.080]   Or a thousand dollars.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.940]   You have a huge.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.220]   Upside.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.300]   But.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.620]   If the cure for cancer.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.700]   Turns out to be bogus.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.360]   You have.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.800]   An unlimited risk of loss.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.220]   Because you can.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:42.480]   Well.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.620]   Not unlimited technically.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:43.960]   You have.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.220]   You have a risk of total loss.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.000]   Where you can lose.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.180]   All of the two dollars.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.840]   You don't have any claim.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.140]   On the financial assets.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.620]   Of the company.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.440]   You don't have any claim.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:51.640]   On.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.400]   Like you would.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.500]   If you invested in the stock.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.040]   Directly.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.560]   You don't have any claim.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.280]   Over.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.600]   Forcing the company.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.400]   To sell the factory.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:58.900]   And taking.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.140]   A portion of that portfolio.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.940]   Of that.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:01.960]   Money for yourself.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.800]   So.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.700]   The underlying.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.100]   A value of the stock.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.780]   Literally.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.760]   Becomes worthless.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.320]   If the.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.040]   If the.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.280]   When the.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:09.920]   When the exercise.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.660]   Date.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.900]   Arrives.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.520]   So.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.740]   Hopefully.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:14.620]   That makes sense.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.080]   It's just a.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.980]   Brief.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.420]   Blink.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.260]   Into derivatives.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.360]   And.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.060]   Today.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.380]   Derivatives are really.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.340]   A major part.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:22.680]   Of the.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.900]   Larger investment.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.420]   Environment.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.720]   And there's many.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.500]   Many ways.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.080]   And reasons.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.020]   That they can be used.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.100]   They can be used.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.380]   As speculative instruments.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.760]   Or they can be used.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.220]   As.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.440]   Ways to manage.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:34.960]   Risk.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:35.460]   So.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:35.920]   Probably.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.140]   The.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.300]   The primary way.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.320]   That derivatives are used.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.760]   Today.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.980]   Is to.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.700]   Hedge risk.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.600]   Or to transfer.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.180]   The risk.
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:43.840]   Of a certain thing.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.280]   Happening.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:44.760]   So.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   If you're managing a.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.440]   If you're managing.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.140]   A portfolio.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.820]   You may be concerned.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.240]   About a certain thing.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.340]   Happening in your portfolio.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.120]   And you recognize.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.160]   That my portfolio.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:53.880]   If.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.320]   This event occurs.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.700]   Then I may want to.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.680]   I may be in a problem.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.040]   So.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.080]   You may go ahead.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.340]   And say.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:52:59.480]   Well.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.120]   I want to insure.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.780]   Against that.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:01.560]   And.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.260]   And the way.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:02.940]   That you insure.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.320]   Against.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:03.580]   That.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:04.220]   In a portfolio.
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.200]   Is through the use.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:05.740]   Of derivatives.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.580]   Whether it's options.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.100]   Futures.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.580]   Swaps.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.420]   There's.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.280]   Lots of.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.320]   Variation.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:10.740]   On these.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.360]   But that's.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:11.940]   Essentially.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.540]   The.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.280]   The value.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:13.800]   Of derivatives.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.540]   So.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.380]   Don't.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:16.760]   And then.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.280]   Last thing.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:17.700]   As far as.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.200]   Assets.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:18.580]   As far as.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.000]   Investments.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.620]   Don't forget.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.780]   That you could always.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.240]   Invest.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:21.880]   In real assets.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.360]   Directly.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:22.640]   So.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   The choice.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.720]   Is not always.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.680]   Should I.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.240]   The choice.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:26.980]   Is not always.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:27.900]   Should I buy.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.220]   This.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:28.880]   This stock.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.400]   Or should I buy.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.040]   This bond.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:30.620]   Or.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.220]   But rather.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:31.780]   The choice.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.040]   Is more of.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.740]   You know.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.220]   Again.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:34.960]   Fruit trees.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.100]   Or shares.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.040]   Of XYZ Corp.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.800]   So.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.080]   That's just a brief overview.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.340]   Now.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.200]   I want to give you an example.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.680]   And talk about.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.540]   Some different ways.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.420]   That these can be used.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.760]   So.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.620]   You can use.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.400]   This concept.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:46.940]   Of stocks.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.380]   And bonds.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.140]   And you can use.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.260]   This in a large.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.460]   Context.
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:50.700]   Of.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.020]   Of.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:51.880]   The stock market.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.180]   Quote.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:52.520]   Unquote.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.300]   As we're.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.760]   Accustomed to thinking about it.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.880]   Or you can use it.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.000]   In a smaller context.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.700]   And.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.640]   It's exactly the same tools.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.380]   They're just applied.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.300]   In a different concept.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.500]   In a different context.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.320]   So.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.400]   Let's start with a very.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.140]   Very simplistic.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.680]   Overly simplistic example.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.540]   And let's.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.700]   Talk about some.
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.640]   Some of the ways.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:09.980]   That.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.240]   We would use.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.440]   Stocks and bonds.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.040]   In our business.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.900]   Let's talk about some of the advantages.
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.600]   And disadvantages.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.480]   I am going to completely ignore.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:17.940]   Now.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.620]   Derivatives.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.240]   And.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.500]   Because derivatives are.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.940]   A little bit more challenging.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:22.420]   If you're not.
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.440]   Comfortable with the lingo.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.580]   A little bit more challenging.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.460]   To wrap your head around.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.340]   And.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.840]   I think we had enough.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.300]   Of an insight.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.080]   With just a simple.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.200]   Options example.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:30.940]   But.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.460]   You could use.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:32.940]   Derivatives.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.340]   And basically.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.260]   You could.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.340]   Create derivatives.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.240]   If you can find a buyer.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:36.780]   For the market.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.800]   You're basically making bets.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.760]   On something happening.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.520]   And.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.340]   As long as you're willing.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.260]   To agree to the terms.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.160]   And agree to the price.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:42.980]   And agree to the risk.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:43.620]   Then.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:44.420]   Then the derivative.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.280]   Should.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:45.940]   Should work.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:46.420]   But for now.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.240]   Let's ignore derivatives.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   And let's just focus on stocks.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:48.720]   And bonds.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.460]   So.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.460]   You and I have.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.560]   I have an idea.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.100]   I have noticed.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.400]   That people are.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.460]   Drinking coffee.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.120]   And that gourmet coffee.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:57.840]   Has now become.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.740]   Quite in vogue.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.660]   And.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.920]   I went.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:01.300]   To.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.740]   You'll notice.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.660]   I'm stealing the story.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.340]   Let's say.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:03.760]   That I went.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.700]   To a European country.
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.320]   I went to Italy.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.120]   And I noticed.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:06.700]   That in Italy.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.280]   It's quite.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.120]   What's the French saying?
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:09.400]   I think.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:09.660]   The.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:09.880]   The.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.060]   The.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:10.120]   The.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.220]   The.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:10.280]   The.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:10.340]   The.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:10.360]   The.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:10.380]   The.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:10.400]   The.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:10.420]   The.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:10.860]   The.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:10.940]   The.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.220]   Quite.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   If I.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:12.500]   If my.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.420]   My usage is correct.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.100]   Quite.
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.380]   Quite popular.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.380]   To sit in a coffee shop.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:17.560]   And.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.940]   Enjoy my coffee.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.980]   And I come to the US.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.860]   And I noticed that.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.120]   I noticed that.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.840]   In my country.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.580]   In the United States.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.100]   That people.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.380]   Coffee is more of just.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.780]   Something that you get at the cafe.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.600]   In a brown cup.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.480]   For 22 cents.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.400]   And I think.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.900]   Why is it that Americans.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:32.820]   Always drink coffee.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.620]   With their breakfast.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.000]   Why don't they actually go.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.140]   And just drink coffee.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.100]   Like the Italians do.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.000]   So I decide to open a coffee shop.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.640]   Now.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.180]   I don't have any money.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.460]   But.
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.440]   I read the book.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.580]   That Jake DeSilis wrote.
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.220]   On entrepreneurship.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:45.900]   And I said.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.880]   Well why would I ever go.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.500]   And get a job.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.680]   When I could just start a business.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.180]   Instead.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.700]   And I listened to Joshua.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.100]   And he said.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:51.300]   Look.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.120]   There's no risk.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.080]   What's the worst that can happen.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:53.800]   I'm going to go bankrupt.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.380]   Big deal.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.320]   So I'm going to go bankrupt.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:56.840]   That's why.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.580]   So I'm going to go ahead.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.320]   And try something.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.860]   So there's no risk.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.640]   I don't have any money now.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.460]   I might make a lot.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.380]   Or I might lose.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.220]   But regardless.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.460]   If I do some smart stuff.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.520]   I'm not going to lose.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:08.540]   And I can control the risk.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.420]   And I can always go sleep.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.300]   On mom and dad's couch.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.100]   And mom will feed me.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:11.900]   So.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.880]   I'm going to open a coffee shop.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.320]   Because I would.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.560]   I think people would enjoy.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.380]   This experience.
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.380]   So.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.080]   But.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.940]   Let's see.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.640]   In my example.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:19.940]   Who's.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.260]   Okay.
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:20.900]   So I'm the guy.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.200]   I'm the guy opening the coffee shop.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.840]   And you're the person with the money.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.300]   So.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:24.980]   I come to you.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.180]   And you have $100,000.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.040]   That you got.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.140]   Because your great aunt Matilda.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:28.740]   Just died.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.940]   And left you $100,000.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:30.940]   And you say.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.320]   Well Joshua.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.380]   Do you need some money?
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.640]   And I say.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.280]   Yes I do.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.980]   Well.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.880]   There's a couple ways.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.900]   That I could give you the money.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.700]   How much do you need?
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.600]   Well frankly.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.520]   I need $100,000.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.400]   To get started.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.480]   I got to buy some coffee.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.400]   Machinery.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.580]   I got to rent a space.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.220]   I've got to hire some employees.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.980]   I've got to invest in some marketing.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.040]   So that people will know.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:49.680]   That I'm there.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.900]   I got to build a logo.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.400]   I've got to buy aprons.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.240]   For my employees.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:54.840]   So I've got.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.720]   I need $100,000.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.960]   And.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.140]   So I said.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:58.320]   Well.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.660]   I'm willing to consider this.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.540]   And.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.680]   You look at me.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.100]   And you say.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:03.340]   Well.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.300]   What would you like to do?
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.480]   Would you like to borrow the money.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.240]   From me.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.680]   Or would you like me.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.680]   You say.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.240]   Would you like to.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.560]   Me to invest in the company.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.480]   I tell you.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:11.800]   Well.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.960]   Frankly.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.840]   I'd like to borrow the money.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.480]   Okay.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.320]   What are your terms?
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.020]   Well you as a rational person.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.080]   You have $100,000.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.800]   And you're looking at me.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.360]   And let's pretend.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.140]   That my example.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.400]   I was a young 18 year old kid.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.040]   Who just got back.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.160]   From.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.200]   From backpacking around Italy.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.220]   And you're saying.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:26.360]   Well.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.580]   How good is Joshua really.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.260]   At running a business.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.220]   After all.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.540]   He has no business experience.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.880]   He has this kind of a harebrained idea.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.280]   That he wants to create a coffee shop.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.780]   Like the Italians do.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.660]   And he wants it to be a certain way.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.360]   But.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:38.920]   Really.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.360]   People like paying 25 cents a cup.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.140]   For a cup of coffee.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.900]   And he wants to charge $3 a cup.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.860]   So how on earth.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.800]   Is this even going to work.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.480]   And.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.520]   You say.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.740]   I think this is pretty risky.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:49.420]   It might work.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:49.660]   And it.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.600]   It might work.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.300]   But.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.440]   It could be pretty risky.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.100]   So you say.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:53.320]   Well.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.120]   I can get.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.760]   Down at the bank.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.340]   I can get 2% interest on my money.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:56.840]   So.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.840]   That's my.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.600]   Essentially.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.360]   My risk free.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.520]   My risk free return.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.500]   And usually.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.180]   In an investment world.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.440]   We would usually not use the bank.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.040]   We would use a.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.240]   Government securities.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.260]   We'd use a treasury bond.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:08.480]   And say.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:08.560]   Well.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.500]   My risk free rate of return.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.440]   If I do nothing else.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.740]   I could lend money to the U.S. government.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.200]   And they'll tax their people.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.760]   Into oblivion.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.220]   To pay me.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:14.840]   So.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:15.520]   I'll go ahead.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.520]   And just lend my money to the government.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.620]   There's my 2% return.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.920]   That's my risk free rate of return.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.640]   So you've got to go over and above it.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.360]   And if you say.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:21.560]   Well.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:22.440]   If I charge Joshua.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.800]   3% rate of return.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.280]   I could lend it to the government.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.020]   At 2%.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.460]   I don't think that's enough.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:29.800]   Of a.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.380]   Of a.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.200]   Of an interest rate.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:31.640]   For me to.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.800]   Take a bet on him.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.680]   And.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.160]   Then also over here.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.580]   I noticed that I read in the newspaper.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.120]   That Walmart.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.260]   Is issuing a bond.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:39.760]   For.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.300]   $100 million.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.180]   To do.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:41.940]   Some project.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.540]   That they're doing.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.120]   And they'll pay me.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.200]   A 4% rate of return.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:44.860]   If I give them.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:45.620]   $100,000.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.840]   So.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.980]   I think Walmart.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.140]   Has probably got a brighter future.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.240]   Than Joshua's coffee shop.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.380]   So you're going to sit down.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:51.600]   And you're going to.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.140]   You're going to figure out.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:52.400]   There's.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.860]   There's going to be some analysis.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.740]   In your mind.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.080]   Of at what point in time.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.260]   Am I willing to lend.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.200]   This $100,000.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:58.840]   To Joshua.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.820]   Now that.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:00.640]   That number.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.800]   May be at 5%.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.480]   Or it may be at 55%.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.120]   It's just completely.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.220]   You may not even be willing.
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:05.740]   To lend it.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:06.260]   So.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.000]   But let's just say.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.600]   As an example.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.460]   Let's say that.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.600]   It is going to be.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.180]   $15,000.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.660]   15% rate of return.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.700]   Or 10% rate of return.
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.400]   And so.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.740]   Under this example.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.020]   If you say.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:17.420]   I'm going to lend it.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.620]   At 10% rate of return.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.200]   Then.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.540]   I look at.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.080]   My books.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.900]   As the borrower.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:23.180]   And say.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.040]   Can I afford to do that?
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:24.140]   Well.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.360]   That means.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:24.920]   I got to come up with.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.640]   $10,000.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.340]   In the first year.
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.360]   Of my coffee shop.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.460]   On top.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.260]   Of paying me.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:31.200]   Paying my employees.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.300]   On top of all the expenses.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:33.000]   To pay the bond.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.260]   To pay the bond payment.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.160]   And I may say.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.400]   Listen.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.020]   I'm not sure.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.900]   I can do that.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.940]   Well.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.300]   We would have that option.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.240]   If I think I can.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.160]   Then I can do that.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:42.980]   Then I would go ahead.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.720]   And accept the deal.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.880]   If I could make the $10,000.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.200]   But I may not be able.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:46.700]   To do it.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.200]   So you say.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:47.360]   Well.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:47.940]   I would be willing.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.960]   To lend you the money.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.880]   But.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:50.620]   Excuse me.
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.160]   Instead of lending you the money.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.060]   I apologize.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.380]   Instead of lending you the money.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:54.920]   I'd be willing.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.940]   To invest the money.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:56.460]   With you.
[00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.020]   And I'd be willing to.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.660]   In exchange.
[00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.460]   For a percentage.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.120]   Of the company.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   I would be willing.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.080]   To invest the money.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.240]   And so.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:03.940]   We can go in.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.020]   As 50-50 partners.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.660]   In this company.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.040]   And I will invest.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.880]   My $100,000.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.600]   And you will invest.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.040]   Your time.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.440]   And effort.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.180]   And knowledge.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.300]   And ideas.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.700]   To build the company.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.620]   And then.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.040]   We will split.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.600]   The profits.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.240]   That we make.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.600]   So that would be.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.420]   A stock investment.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.500]   So I would draw up.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:20.960]   Some papers.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.800]   And I would issue.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.980]   Shares of stock.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.560]   And I could issue.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.580]   Two shares of stock.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.500]   And I could issue.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.180]   One share to me.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.840]   And one share to you.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.080]   Now.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   Realistically.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.400]   One of the values.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.280]   Of companies.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:30.760]   Is that.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.480]   We can issue.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.540]   More shares of stock.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.220]   So I would probably.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.760]   Issue 1,000 shares of stock.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.180]   And then 500 of them.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.840]   Would go to you.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.720]   And 500 of them.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.280]   Would go to me.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.160]   Now.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.080]   This is an incredible way.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.760]   Of basically creating wealth.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.660]   When a company issues stock.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.520]   It's simply.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.640]   Issuing ownership.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.220]   In an identity.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:47.480]   In an idea.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   In a concept.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.860]   In exchange for money.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.080]   So if I created this situation.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.300]   Then what I've really done.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.780]   In this scenario.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.520]   If I create.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.400]   My company.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.260]   And I issue 1,000 shares of stock.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:01.220]   And you give $100,000.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.140]   And I buy $100,000 of assets.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.500]   I have just.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.040]   Printed money from my company.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.540]   By issuing you shares of stock.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.360]   Now you.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.240]   Have claim.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.500]   Over 50% of the assets.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.280]   But I have claim.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.820]   Over 50% of the assets as well.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.560]   So.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.100]   We've just had this transaction.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.360]   And my company.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.040]   Has been.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:17.600]   Decapitalized.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.780]   It had money come in.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.660]   To build my company.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.560]   And.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.400]   Now.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.300]   I'm ready to go.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.760]   With stocks.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.480]   And we could do this.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:23.860]   We do this.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.220]   People.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   Entrepreneurs do this.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.800]   Every single day.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.720]   Now.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.060]   It's very simple.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:28.800]   With one person.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.400]   But what if I want to go ahead.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.420]   And over time.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.140]   Let's say you and I.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:32.800]   Business grows.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.460]   You've chosen to invest in my company.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.620]   You own stock in my company.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.040]   And we're doing really well.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.620]   And now we have two locations.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.220]   In my hometown.
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:39.780]   But I've.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.820]   I've done market research.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.740]   And I know there's people.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.760]   All over the country.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.160]   That are asking for.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:44.780]   More shares.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.620]   That are asking.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.760]   For these locations.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.160]   Of my.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.600]   My coffee business.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.240]   In their town.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.060]   Well.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:50.740]   In this situation.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.400]   And we could go.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:51.780]   And we could say.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.620]   We need more money.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.640]   But you don't have any more.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.560]   And I don't have any more.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.800]   And we're trying to fund it.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.940]   Out of the profits of the company.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.720]   But we can't really expand fast enough.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.900]   Because we're only making a profit.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.600]   Of a few thousand bucks a month.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   And every new store.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.060]   That we open.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.100]   Is a hundred thousand.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.420]   Is a hundred thousand dollars.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.200]   So we're profitable.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.940]   But we're not profitable enough.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:08.860]   To grow very fast.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.340]   We can only open two stores a year.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.120]   We'd like to do 200 stores a year.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.160]   So we could go to the open market.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.440]   We could go to the public market.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.680]   And this is what's called.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.400]   An investment lingo.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.860]   This is called a primary offering.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.780]   Or an initial public offering.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.920]   And we could say.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.880]   We would like to solicit you.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.300]   To invest your money with us.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.440]   Our business plan.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.200]   Is that we're going to open.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.280]   A chain of stores.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.360]   And in exchange.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.580]   For you giving us your money.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.300]   So that we can open.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.500]   Our chain of coffee stores.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.640]   You're going to give us your money.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.620]   And we're going to try to raise.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.680]   Ten million dollars.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.660]   Or a hundred million dollars.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.860]   And you're going to try.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:39.620]   To give us your money.
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.280]   And in exchange for that.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.400]   We'll give you shares of the company.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.740]   So we draw up.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.940]   Some fancy stock certificates.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.520]   Or in the past.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.100]   We would have done that.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:46.740]   Now we just created.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.960]   An entry in a.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.840]   In a journal.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.700]   In a journal entry.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.680]   A journal entry in a ledger.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.700]   And we print up these.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.740]   These shares of stock.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.700]   Then we go ahead.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.520]   And we issue them.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.360]   To the public market.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.780]   And let's say that you think.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.580]   That's a good investment.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.660]   So you give us your money.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.380]   Now we have ten.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.400]   Ten million dollars.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.240]   So we go ahead.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.280]   And we start opening stores.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.700]   And then now you.
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.600]   Have claim.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.420]   In a share.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.180]   Of the profit.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.100]   From all of those stores.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.740]   This is how companies work.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.680]   This is how business works.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.940]   Now there are various players involved.
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.340]   And it can work.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.340]   All along the way.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.500]   And then that same company.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.200]   After we've issued.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.080]   The more shares of the stock.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.880]   And we've grown out.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.800]   To be a hundred stores.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.960]   We may need to.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.460]   Some.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.200]   Some.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.340]   We may want to start.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.500]   Building buildings.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.960]   And so we need a special.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.100]   We need a special.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.200]   Influx of cash.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:29.640]   To go ahead.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.680]   And build our own buildings.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.960]   Our freestanding locations.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.620]   Instead of.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.520]   Going ahead.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.140]   And building.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.780]   Instead of going ahead.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780]   And renting them.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.200]   So we may issue a bond.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.280]   And we may promise.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.360]   To pay a five percent.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:40.900]   Payment.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.960]   If you'll lend us the money.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.900]   And the reason.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.580]   That we would do that.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.660]   Is if we could borrow the money.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:44.980]   From you.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:45.160]   The public.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:45.480]   The public.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.040]   At more favorable terms.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.920]   Than we could borrow the money.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.480]   From a bank.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.580]   So.
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.240]   Hopefully.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.280]   My example made sense.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.240]   And it was a little bit interesting.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.420]   But you can do this.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.560]   At all different scales.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.640]   You can do this.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.700]   At every single scale.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.480]   You can do this.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.360]   As an individual.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:03:59.900]   You know.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.480]   You can do this.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.000]   As an individual.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:02.660]   And own a corporation.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.440]   You can do this.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.540]   With a couple of people.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.320]   And own a corporation.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.680]   It can be a small corporation.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.080]   It can be a large corporation.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.980]   So everything.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.600]   From Apple computers.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.140]   Or whatever.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:11.800]   Apple Inc.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.940]   To.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:14.860]   A local mom.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.140]   And pop cleaning business.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.020]   You can do this.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:17.740]   Now.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.960]   The value of those shares.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.880]   Is going to be based upon.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:20.420]   The company.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:20.920]   That's under.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.140]   That's underlying.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.320]   And the assets of the company.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.860]   If I have a cleaning business.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:25.560]   And I try to.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.440]   To sell you.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.420]   Shares in my cleaning business.
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.600]   But my cleaning business.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.460]   Consists of me.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.100]   And my car.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:31.640]   With a broom.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.180]   And a mop.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.540]   Going to the local.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.880]   Going to someone's house.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.160]   And trying to say.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:36.560]   Hey.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.880]   I don't really have any assets.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.160]   Basically.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.180]   I have customer accounts.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.640]   So to try to issue a stock.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.340]   Based upon that.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.060]   And you to figure out.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.800]   What the value of that is.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.440]   It's very difficult.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.840]   That's very.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.100]   Different than Exxon Mobil.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.060]   That they say.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.980]   Look at these oil wells.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.680]   Look at all this.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.000]   This.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.260]   These assets that we have.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.100]   And you can more easily.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:51.960]   Figure out what the value.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.700]   Of the stock would be.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.580]   So.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.940]   If you understand that.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.580]   And it seems a little simplistic.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.740]   But if you really understand.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.560]   That it helps.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.720]   When you're trying to figure out.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.640]   What should I invest in.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.540]   And how should I invest.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.300]   And do all of that.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.380]   So the key point.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.240]   That I wanted to try to.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.680]   Drive home today.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.880]   Is that you need to really understand.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.100]   How these things work.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:09.460]   And hopefully.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.880]   This just basic introduction.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.800]   To stocks and bonds.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.200]   Would give you some idea.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.000]   Of what these are.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.860]   And you can use these.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.180]   At every stage of your wealth.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.440]   You could use these.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.400]   If you have a lot of money.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.060]   And you want to buy shares.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.000]   Of general electric stock.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.840]   You can also use this.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.800]   If you don't have any money.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.040]   And you're trying to start a business.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.660]   And so you're trying to start a business.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.020]   You can issue shares of stock.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:30.840]   And raise capital.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.340]   You can use bonds.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.220]   If you want to invest.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.480]   In long term savings bonds.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.220]   For your grandchildren.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.520]   And you say.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.120]   The U.S. government.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.000]   Is always going to be there.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:38.880]   It's not going to be much.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.880]   It's not going to have risk.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   You know.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.800]   Risk of default.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.600]   But.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.540]   You know.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.100]   At least.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:44.800]   At least it's safe.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.640]   I'm going to go ahead and get it.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.740]   So you can lend your money.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.480]   To the U.S. government.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.020]   Or you can lend your money.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:49.520]   To.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.400]   General Motors.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.420]   When they need.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.860]   When they issue a bond.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.720]   Or you can lend your money.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.820]   To the local municipality.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.520]   When they want to build a new highway.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.220]   Or when they want to build a new stadium.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.060]   These types of things.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:01.720]   Now.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.280]   With every one of those transactions.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.000]   And decisions.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.780]   Then there's going to be.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.040]   There's going to be a trade off.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.240]   Now here's the key point.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:08.940]   That I'm going to end with.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.140]   Buying stocks.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.380]   Or shares of ownership.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:13.960]   In companies.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.360]   In the publicly traded markets.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.980]   It's not always going to be the best move.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.880]   I don't believe it's possible.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.340]   To get really get rich quick.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.620]   On buying stocks.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.020]   Because.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.360]   You have a large company.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.620]   That's a very valuable thing.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.380]   But for your.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.460]   If you're a young person.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.740]   It's not going to do much for you.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.620]   What is.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.020]   You know.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.420]   What is.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.380]   A 10 percent.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.000]   Growth rate going to mean.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.400]   If you're going to investing a hundred dollars.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.880]   Over a long period of time.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.040]   A huge amount of money.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.980]   But over the next five or ten years.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.280]   How much is it really going to mean?
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:40.960]   Now.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.580]   If you have a decision.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.980]   Between not investing a hundred dollars.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.740]   Let's just run some numbers.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:44.960]   Here.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.020]   And usually.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.540]   Let's say that you're 20 years old.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.320]   And you're listening to me.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.600]   And you're going to go to the.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.060]   Traditional retirement age of 65.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.100]   So let's just say.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.220]   You're going to invest a hundred dollars.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:53.600]   A month.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.980]   Let's say that you're going to get.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.640]   The.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.320]   Let's clear this out here.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.180]   Clear the register.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:58.440]   Okay.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.340]   A hundred dollars a month.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.000]   It's our payment.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.960]   We're going to do this for 45 years.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.880]   On a monthly basis.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.020]   We're going to use.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.140]   A 10 percent number.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:05.800]   Compounded.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.600]   10 percent annually.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.940]   For the rate of return.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.620]   And we're going to start with nothing.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.180]   At the end of 45 years.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.320]   If you invest a hundred dollars.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:14.720]   You're going to have.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.400]   A one million.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.220]   Forty eight thousand.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.180]   Two hundred and fifty dollars.
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.080]   And seventeen cents.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080]   Not adjusted for inflation.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.000]   So we're going to have.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.620]   A million bucks.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.400]   But the reality is.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.500]   Is that what does a million bucks.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.020]   Do for us in 45 years.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.540]   Versus what could we do.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.240]   With a hundred dollars.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.000]   Now if we took that hundred dollars.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.680]   And we went out.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.480]   And we started a business.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.160]   With it today.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.380]   We have the possibility.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.040]   Of instead of making.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.040]   A 10 percent rate of return.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.240]   To make a 10 thousand percent.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:36.820]   Rate of return.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.300]   If we take an idea.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.120]   And we put an idea.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.360]   For a film.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   And we put it on Kickstarter.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.500]   And we get that film funded.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.460]   And then we.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.680]   We raise our capital that way.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.740]   Or if we issue stock.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:46.160]   Or if we.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.060]   Whatever our project is.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.140]   We can do it quicker.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.680]   Or if we go and buy.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.800]   Fruit trees for the yard.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.560]   Or if we go and.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.340]   Invest in.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.300]   Whatever we invested.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.620]   I mean this is what.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.920]   The choices of investment.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.520]   Should be.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.220]   So once you understand.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.120]   The role that these.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.360]   Financial assets can have.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.080]   You could decide.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.220]   If it's worth it to you.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.680]   To invest your money.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.140]   Into.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.020]   General electric stock.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.200]   Or if it's worth your.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.500]   Worth your money to you.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.700]   To invest your money.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:11.220]   In.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.980]   Hosting for your podcast.
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.640]   On financial.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.380]   Planning to.
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.740]   To teach people.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.400]   About the topics.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.160]   Of financial planning.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   I personally decided.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:20.960]   That's a better investment.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.700]   For me right now.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:21.940]   Now.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.900]   Is it always going to be so.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.360]   No.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:23.920]   Absolutely.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.940]   Absolutely not.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.840]   It doesn't get better.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.740]   If you have money.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.200]   And if you want.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:29.780]   True.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.700]   Financial independence.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.920]   If you want.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.320]   True.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.000]   Capitalism.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.100]   Where you can just sit back.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.140]   And you can collect money.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:35.500]   Without.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.920]   Any real work.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.620]   True.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.500]   Financial independence.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.860]   Where you don't have to do.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.340]   Anything.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.100]   I think only.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.840]   Ultimately comes.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.000]   From.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:42.760]   Loaning companies.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.360]   That you don't need to.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.040]   Necessarily control.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.560]   Or be involved.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:44.780]   In.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.880]   And I tell you.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.920]   General Electric.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.480]   And Apple.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.300]   And Exxon Mobil.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:48.800]   And Walmart.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.780]   And.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.140]   These companies.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.640]   That's an amazing way.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.100]   To do it.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.180]   But if you're just getting started.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.180]   And you're trying to fix something out.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.660]   It may.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:57.620]   Or it may not be.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.700]   The right move for you.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.480]   So.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.680]   All financial planning.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.640]   Comes down to personal.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.460]   And this is why.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.340]   I'm building this show.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.140]   Because.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.580]   For so many years.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:06.300]   I got motivated.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.980]   And I read these books.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.320]   On.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:08.980]   Put your money.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.620]   In the stock market.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.660]   I think that's awesome.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.280]   I've managed.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.600]   Large portfolios.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.540]   But.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:14.220]   I wish.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:14.500]   At this.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:14.740]   Point.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.440]   That instead of opening.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.040]   A Roth IRA.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.000]   On my 18th birthday.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.560]   That I had started.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.320]   A couple of businesses.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.600]   Because you know what.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.180]   There's no one.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:20.980]   On the Forbes 400.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.720]   That got there.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.180]   By opening a Roth IRA.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.940]   Entrepreneurship.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:25.660]   And building something.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.620]   And investing in something.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.500]   That you own.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.280]   Or that you control.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.160]   Is.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:29.740]   Is.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.840]   Is going to be incredible.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.080]   Now what that is for you.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:32.740]   I don't know.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.740]   But.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.540]   The decision.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.400]   Should not be.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.840]   Should I buy shares of Apple.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840]   Or shares of GE.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.380]   The decision should be.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.920]   Should I buy shares of Apple.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.480]   Should I buy shares of GE.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.380]   Should I buy.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.040]   A pickup truck.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.340]   And start a landscaping business.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.220]   Should I build a rental house.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.200]   And rent it out.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.160]   Because I have the ability.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.920]   To build things.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.280]   And.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:51.520]   And.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:51.620]   And.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.480]   Put a tenant in there.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.460]   And give them a place to live.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.060]   Should I buy a local.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.760]   Hotel franchise.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.120]   And invest in a days in.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:58.840]   At the local.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.700]   Interchange.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:09:59.980]   Between.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:00.560]   You know.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.440]   The interstate.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.780]   And the local road.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:04.560]   Should I buy a subway franchise.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.940]   And open a subway location.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.400]   Should I.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.760]   Buy treasury bonds.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   From the U.S. government.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.000]   Should I pay off my.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.440]   High interest rate credit card debt.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.720]   Or should I pay off my house.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.120]   Should I buy solar panels.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:14.480]   From my house.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.080]   So I can.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.300]   Reduce or eliminate.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.160]   My electric bill.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.400]   Should I insulate my attic.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.280]   So that I can reduce.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.420]   Or eliminate my electric bill.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.640]   Should I buy fruit trees.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.380]   From my front yard.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.180]   So that I don't need to.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.740]   Buy so much groceries.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.620]   Should I.
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.980]   Call up and buy a load.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.560]   Of horse manure.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.720]   From my backyard garden.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.900]   So I can grow some food.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.320]   Should I buy gold coins.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:31.860]   Or should I.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.680]   Buy food.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.760]   Should I buy cans of soup.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.380]   For the pantry.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.300]   Should I.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.320]   Give the money away.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.200]   Or should I go and buy education.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.240]   And a college degree.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.040]   Which hopefully will.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.100]   Will get me a higher.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.860]   Higher value in the marketplace.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.440]   This is the decision.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.660]   And this is why.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.680]   All financial planning.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.480]   Must be.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.560]   Intensely personal.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.260]   I'm never going to tell anyone again.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.200]   Without knowing them.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.060]   Here's what you should do.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:53.540]   With your money.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.540]   You should just go.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.540]   And you should buy this stock.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.620]   Or you should invest in.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.940]   This index fund.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:58.820]   Or you should do this.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.460]   It's so much bigger.
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.260]   And more complicated.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:01.780]   Than that.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:02.380]   But.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.120]   It's so much simpler.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.500]   Than that.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.360]   But you've got to look at your life.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.160]   And you've got to figure out.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.200]   What are my skills.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.120]   What are my goals.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.720]   What are the things.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.840]   That I'm trying to do.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.720]   What is it.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.200]   What is it.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.360]   That's going to work for me.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.400]   And then based upon.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:14.760]   That.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.620]   Then you can make.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.540]   A rational decision.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.700]   About what will serve you.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.380]   And your interests.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:18.960]   And your goals.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.540]   To the best.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.160]   To the best.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.340]   You can make a rational decision.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.100]   On what will serve you.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.680]   And your interests.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.220]   And your goals.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.480]   In the best way.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.760]   And in the most intelligent way.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.320]   For you to get.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.380]   From here to there.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.120]   In the quickest way.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.860]   So.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.720]   Remember.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.940]   You can literally.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.120]   And that's why I get so excited.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:33.860]   About entrepreneurship.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.940]   Is because.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:35.760]   A lot of times.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.120]   People say.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:36.560]   I'm broke.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.420]   I don't have any money.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.320]   Okay.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   How are you going to get it?
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.320]   I don't know.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.520]   I only earn X amount of dollars.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:42.720]   Well.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.500]   Why are you only earning.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.280]   X amount of dollars?
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.680]   There's people making.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.800]   Ten times what you're making.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.860]   No matter how much you're making.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.780]   So why don't you become.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.580]   One of those people.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.960]   Can earn ten times that much.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.060]   You can start at Walmart.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.000]   As whatever their.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.460]   Basic entry level wages.
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.360]   And retire a multi-millionaire.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.040]   You can move up.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:11:59.860]   In any company.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.580]   Any business.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.480]   Or you can just go out.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.400]   And create your own.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.700]   I was watching a video.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.180]   On YouTube.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:05.840]   I was researching.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.800]   Some camera things.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.680]   And I saw a guy.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.880]   He actually.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.560]   I was watching.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.860]   His creative live class.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:12.400]   That he taught.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:12.620]   Which.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.400]   If you have any interest.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.080]   In creative arts.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.380]   Go check out creative live.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.660]   They're doing an amazing job.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.840]   Of just incredible.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.700]   Free.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.980]   Creative education.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.620]   On photography.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.400]   And music.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.340]   And just all of these.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.220]   Fascinating classes.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.360]   That are all available for free.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.420]   Right on their website.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.160]   They have at this point.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.040]   I think five studios.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.660]   Running around 24 hours a day.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.360]   On their network.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.860]   And I was watching.
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.340]   The photography class.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:34.720]   And this guy.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.320]   Was a filmmaker.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.360]   And I guess.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   He was doing some work.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:37.680]   For.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.960]   He was doing some work.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.220]   For somebody.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.360]   He was flat broke.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.640]   And he was doing some work.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.180]   With a guy.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.820]   As a part time employee.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.500]   But he wanted to make a movie.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:46.900]   And so this.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.680]   This man.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.540]   Had written a script.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.300]   For his movie.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.320]   And.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.520]   He wanted to create it.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.820]   So he had some friends.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:54.480]   Of his acting.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.320]   And he'd written the script.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.840]   And he borrowed from his boss.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.880]   He borrowed.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   The camera.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.920]   And all they had.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.200]   Was one of these.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.000]   Canon digital SLR cameras.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.220]   Basically about $750.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.140]   Worth of gear.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.560]   A $500 camera.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.580]   He went to.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.160]   Home Depot.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.980]   Bought a roll of duct tape.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.140]   Duct tape.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.140]   A piece of wood.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.120]   And a broomstick.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120]   Onto a skateboard.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.120]   To make his dolly.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.380]   To create his movement shots.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.720]   And he created a movie.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.620]   Which he wound up.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.200]   Producing.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.600]   And he created the whole thing.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.200]   And he sold it.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.280]   And he wound up.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.580]   I didn't get the full story.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.260]   But he wound up.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.960]   Making some money.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.060]   And just breaking into.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:28.880]   A whole new career.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.640]   And a movie career.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.740]   And being able.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.540]   Just to do something.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.300]   With almost no.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.180]   With almost nothing.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:33.600]   Equipment.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.460]   Just a little bit of skill.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.480]   And a little bit of ideas.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.200]   And you see that all the time.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:37.740]   I mean.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:38.460]   In today's world.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.440]   You can literally print money.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.200]   Without being the government.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:42.500]   You can print money.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.380]   If you can bring.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:44.780]   Knowledge.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.260]   Skills.
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:45.840]   And ideas.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.460]   To the table.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.000]   So whether it's through.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.640]   A kickstarter.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.680]   Whether it's through.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.540]   Issuing stock.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.580]   Whether it's just through.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:51.900]   Doing.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.340]   You know.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.880]   Creating a feature length film.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.820]   With excellent production value.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:56.660]   That you can display.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.440]   And get your break.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.340]   Into the movie business.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.420]   With $750.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:00.660]   Worth of camera equipment.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.380]   I was blown away.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.300]   By the quality of his.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.160]   Of his.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.600]   Production.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.260]   It was amazing.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.680]   Like you can do this.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.980]   You can do this.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.900]   But you got to think about.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.720]   It's going to be unique for you.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:10.960]   So.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.780]   That's why.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.400]   And in essence.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.760]   That's what my frustration.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.480]   With kind of being.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.900]   A traditional financial advisor.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.320]   Is that.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.420]   If I was paid.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.740]   Based upon the sale.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.820]   Of securities.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.500]   And you tell me.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:21.780]   Joshua.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.620]   I want to make a movie.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.220]   There's so many different ways.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:25.800]   To handle that.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.540]   And I just have to say.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:27.020]   Well I mean.
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.160]   Maybe you should not invest.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:28.440]   $100.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.540]   In an IRA.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.900]   And rather you should take that money.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.700]   And go make your movie.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:32.900]   You should only invest.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.820]   $100 in an IRA.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.180]   If Walmart.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.960]   Is going to pay you more money.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.980]   For easier.
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.080]   In exchange for them.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.820]   Having your $100.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.180]   Then you can do it.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.060]   In your own life.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.080]   So I want to empower you.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:44.900]   To make those decisions.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.700]   Hopefully today's.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.560]   Information.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.260]   Has been interesting.
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.420]   You know.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.280]   Sometimes with.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.300]   A lot of these shows.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.500]   With just as far as.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.460]   The detailed information.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.940]   I'm not sure exactly.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.900]   How this is all going to work.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.580]   Over the long term.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.160]   I just feel like.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.180]   I got to set the foundation.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.740]   And sometimes people are saying.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.720]   What are stocks and bonds.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.060]   And I don't know about you.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:01.360]   But.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.060]   There was very little.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.080]   Thought about this in school.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.640]   And even though.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.240]   I went to a school.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.140]   That did actually teach.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.260]   Some of this stuff.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.940]   I didn't learn it through that.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.340]   I.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:10.440]   I.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:10.500]   I.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:10.860]   I.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:10.880]   I.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:10.940]   I.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:16.440]   learned it through myself. I tell you, I've heard some people say some crazy stuff about stocks and
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.900]   this is what's going to happen with stocks. This is what's going to happen with bonds. I think
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.740]   you understand what a stock or a bond is. Hopefully, today has helped with that.
