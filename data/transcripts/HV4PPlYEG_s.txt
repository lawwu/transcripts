[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Of course, we are called to glorify God in everything that we think and say and do.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.540]   But the Bible also says that God will glorify us, his children.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.780]   So what in the world does that mean?
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.380]   It's a question that comes to us from a listener named Nicholas.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.660]   Pastor John, I'm very grateful for your love for the Lord and for your ministry.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.580]   In John chapter 5 verse 44, Jesus challenges the Pharisees in where they seek their glory.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.940]   How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.140]   that comes from the only God?
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.300]   It seems that Jesus is indirectly telling us to seek glory from God.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.220]   How do we balance this with desiring to glorify him?
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.500]   What is the difference in the link between me glorifying God and God glorifying me?
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.580]   The difference between glorifying God and seeking glory from God is the difference between
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:06.780]   our making God look like what he really is and God making us into what we are definitely
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.620]   not—namely, beautiful and glorious in his image.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:21.580]   We are created to glorify God, that is, by treasuring him and valuing him above all else
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.620]   to show him to be infinitely valuable above all else in our lives and in the world—Isaiah
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.620]   43:7.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:40.000]   But we're also created to be glorious or to be glorified, since we're not yet glorious.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.380]   Not in the sense—glorified not in the sense of being shown to be supremely valuable like
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.580]   God, but in the sense of being conformed to the image of Christ.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.980]   So the key passage is Romans 8, 29, and 30.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.700]   "Those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.980]   order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980]   Look-alikes.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.620]   "And those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he justified; and
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.700]   those whom he justified, he glorified."
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.300]   And that glorified refers back to that conforming to the image of his Son.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.540]   God does not intend for his Son to have an ugly bride.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.140]   Jonathan Edwards makes a very big deal out of the point of the universe being the creation
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.260]   and preparation of a bride for his Son.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.420]   Ephesians 5, 27, "So that he might present the church to himself in splendor."
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.580]   Present the church—Christ died for the church so that he might present the church to himself
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.220]   in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220]   blemish.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:18.220]   Now, the way this fits together with our glorifying Christ is, first, that we are his workmanship.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.160]   We don't make ourselves beautiful.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.340]   We aren't intrinsically beautiful.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.500]   We are intrinsically abhorrent in our rebellion against God.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:36.420]   He makes us beautiful, and therefore our beauty reflects his primary power and grace and beauty
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.980]   as the creator of our beauty.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.380]   The second way our glorification relates to the glory of Christ is that his glory is the
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.700]   template from which our glory is designed, shaped, and brought about.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.660]   Therefore, if anyone looks upon us and thinks we are glorious, it will be because they've
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.700]   already looked at Christ, found him to be glorious, and then looked at us and say, "Oh,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.160]   you're like that, and I love that."
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:23.100]   So there's no conflict in pursuing the glory of Christ and pursuing being glorified by
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.100]   Christ, which means that we shouldn't be shocked to read Romans 2.6.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.860]   I think a lot of Christians are shocked to read it when Paul says in Romans 2.6, "God
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.340]   will render to each one according to his works.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.820]   To those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.520]   give eternal life.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.860]   But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.780]   they will receive wrath and fury.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.220]   There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.380]   and also to the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.460]   Jew first and also the Greek, for God shows no partiality."
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:31.020]   There's a deep flaw in our thinking and our souls if we are not seeking this glory
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.340]   and honor.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:41.260]   No one can love God and not want to be conformed to the image of God, but we will always want
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.980]   our glory to be derivative.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.580]   We'll always want our glory to be reflective, not original, reflective of the original,
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.400]   and we will always love the way the two are put together in 2 Thessalonians 1.11.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.660]   To this we always pray for you.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.500]   To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, may
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.140]   fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power so that the name of
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.140]   our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you in him.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.820]   Amazing, beautiful, bringing together the Lord Jesus glorified in you and you glorified
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.420]   in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.180]   So when Jesus says, and this is the text that Nicholas asked about, when Jesus says in John
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:48.300]   5:44, "How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek, do
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.340]   not seek the glory that comes from the only God?"
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.860]   I think he means if you find the praise of other people and the honor of other people
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.620]   and the greatness of other people more satisfying than the greatness of God and the praise of
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.540]   God and the honor that comes from God and the beautification that comes from God, you
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.100]   will be so man-centered that you will not be able to believe on Jesus.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.660]   Yeah, that is a sobering warning.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.940]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Nicholas, for the question.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.100]   Really good question.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.300]   If you are perplexed over a theology question that you can't seem to wrap your mind around
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.240]   or a Bible passage that seems to contradict other Bible passages that you've read, send
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.340]   those questions into us.
