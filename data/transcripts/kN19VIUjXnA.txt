[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   Kayla, all right, Kayla says,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.700]   "I was wondering if you'd speak about
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.520]   "how you've applied deep life concepts to time with kids.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.180]   "We have five kids from seven months to 12 years,
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.200]   "and I've chosen to only work part-time for now,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   "which means I am actively parenting
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.500]   "from one to 8 p.m. most days."
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.860]   Put a pin in that, I have a question about that.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.160]   But let's keep rolling for now,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.780]   but I think Laura has a question about that too.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.460]   "Time with them can easily feel reactive and unstructured.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.900]   "I don't wanna create too much structure
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.380]   "because with all the moving parts,
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.220]   "I imagine that would only lead to frustration,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.240]   "but I also feel that there could be more intentionality
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.380]   "in the way that I spend time with them."
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.400]   Oh, this is kind of interesting.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.620]   Okay, so deep life, Laura,
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.340]   I use this phrase on my podcast a lot,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.420]   being intentional about the different aspects of your life.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.280]   So I guess she's wondering about
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.000]   how do you do that with kids?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.100]   Now, how close is this range to yours, by the way?
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.700]   Do you have four kids or five kids?
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.780]   - Four kids, me, like three years ago, roughly.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.620]   - Oh, your oldest is 16 now.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.460]   - My oldest is 16 now.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.860]   He just turned 16, and my youngest is three.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.420]   - And your oldest watches the youngest,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.260]   that's how it works, right?
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.800]   So your oldest just watches all the other kids,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.420]   and that's how that works?
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.260]   Isn't that how it works?
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.020]   - No, well, he can, he can, and he does some.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.660]   But I try not to hit my kids up for too much babysitting
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.500]   when they have other things that they would like
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.100]   to be doing with their time, like studying and such.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.380]   But, you know, it's a lot of kids.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.220]   (laughs)
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.580]   It is a lot of kids when you have five of them.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.720]   I totally love this question, though,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.700]   because she's correct that time with children
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.620]   often does feel very reactive,
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.460]   and even if you do have routines,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.540]   it can feel very unstructured at times.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.300]   And in many cases, it doesn't feel particularly enjoyable.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.620]   And clearly, she's chosen to work part-time
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.300]   because she wants to spend more time with her kids,
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.940]   and yet it can feel like that's not the good part of the day
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.660]   because, I mean, partly the kids have their own things
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.860]   going on, and, you know, five kids can be pretty chaotic.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.900]   But I think approaching this
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.740]   with some amount of intentionality,
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.860]   and this goes for anyone,
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.260]   and sort of those hours after work and before bed.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.220]   Like, I feel like these are the hardest hours
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.380]   to use well in our lives, because we're tired,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.740]   we're all there, like we all need to get through
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.960]   to the end of the day, and it could be a really cool time,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.760]   but in many cases, it just isn't.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.100]   But being somewhat intentional about it,
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.060]   like saying, you know, what is some little adventure
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.660]   we could have today?
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.220]   Like, what would I like to have done with a kid
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.260]   or some number of kids by the end of the day?
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.460]   And it can be simple, it's just like, okay, well,
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.660]   you know, before we pick up the big kids at school,
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.040]   we're gonna go to the library and get these books
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.140]   from this author that I learned was really good,
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.220]   and then we're going to read those at night.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.140]   That's my intention for today.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.540]   And that would probably make it a better day
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.560]   than if you didn't have that intention,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.060]   or I've looked at the weather, and, you know,
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.820]   Thursday and Friday are going to be great,
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.140]   so when we pick up the big kids at school,
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.420]   we're all going to, you know, go to this playground,
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.300]   and the 12-year-old can, you know, go read
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.980]   or do whatever the 12-year-old does
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.860]   and ignore the rest of us, and then, you know,
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.580]   the rest of us will play on the playground,
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.420]   and I've invited this other family to join us,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.420]   and that's gonna make it more enjoyable for me
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.180]   and for everyone else.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.220]   Yeah, just thinking it through like that
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.780]   allows the time to feel like it's possible to enjoy it
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.340]   as opposed to just, like, dealing with whatever crisis
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.180]   arises in the moment.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.840]   - I like that.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.420]   The other thing I noticed here,
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.420]   this 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. caught my attention
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.300]   because parenting multiple kids,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.140]   especially if there's a seven-month involved,
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.100]   is as draining as any job you're doing
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.300]   maybe outside of if you're actively on, like,
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.260]   a SEAL team rescue mission, right?
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.700]   I mean, it is very draining.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.140]   So if you're working a job till one
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.940]   and then you're taking the kids from one to eight,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.940]   I'm gonna guess, I don't know the context,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.300]   but I'm guessing Caleb maybe has a partner that says,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.540]   "Well, great, since you're now home with the kids
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.280]   "in the afternoon, I can work till,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.260]   "I have a hard job and I can work till eight."
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.340]   So the way I would see this then is you have two parents
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.940]   who have jobs that you're working until 8 p.m.,
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.140]   and when you see that situation,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.740]   okay, we have two very high power,
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.400]   like jobs that require that much work,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.380]   almost always the answer is you are gonna have
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.700]   to bring in outside guns to help with that, right?
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700]   This is the two law partner parents, the two executives.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.000]   There's a lot of households like this
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.880]   around where I live in D.C.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.940]   They end up having huge amounts of support for that.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.660]   They have night nurses with the young babies.
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.500]   They have nannies to pick people up from school
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.340]   and take them there.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.940]   They have coverage in the evening.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.180]   I didn't know about, I don't know if you know
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.360]   about these evening nannies, you know about this,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.420]   where you have one nanny that is during the day
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.100]   and then you switch to another nanny who comes at four
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.220]   to make the meals and deal with the kids or whatever.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.520]   It's what you do when you have spouses
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.380]   that both work jobs that require this much time.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.900]   So that's the other thing that occurred to me.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.960]   It's like, well, you're working a very, very long hour job
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.740]   and it sounds like perhaps your partner is too.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.960]   You have to acknowledge how hard that is
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.120]   and is that really sustainable without either a lot of help
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.960]   or maybe saying maybe you shouldn't be working
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.860]   to your partner till eight every day.
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.620]   If that might not be necessary,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.160]   he might just be thinking, oh, this is great.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.480]   We don't have to worry about childcare.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   There's always someone here,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.600]   so I can just spend time at the office or do whatever.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.480]   I don't know, the 8 p.m. caught my attention.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   - Yeah, well, he could, I mean,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.520]   or maybe they're both there, who knows?
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   I mean, but yeah, if he's working late every night,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.640]   I would certainly say you might wanna bring in
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.040]   a little bit of reinforcements to help you with this
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.960]   and if he has the option of not doing that,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.240]   again, we do the thing where each partner
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.080]   gets one night off, right?
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.920]   - Do that more clearly, yeah.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.760]   - So Tuesday, he's home at five
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.040]   and you go off and do your thing
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.480]   and then obviously you're on till eight
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.320]   the other nights anyway,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.880]   so he can do his thing if he wants to as well.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.480]   And one thing with five kids
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.600]   is it's a lot for one individual anyway.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.880]   If you think about the staffing ratio in a daycare,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.600]   they don't let you have more than four babies per adult
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.360]   and there's something to be said for that.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.760]   Granted, they've got older kids,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.720]   so I'm sure it's not quite the same,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.200]   but if you have multiple little ones,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.520]   one thing that actually I've found
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.000]   makes parenting more pleasant
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   is actually getting to interact with the older kids
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.480]   and so sometimes I have time that I am not working
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.680]   but if my husband is gone or something like that,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.400]   I'll have a sitter for the younger kids
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.240]   and so then I can go do stuff with the big ones
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.440]   and that can allow for a lot more enjoyment of this time
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.480]   'cause then you're doing something
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.120]   that let's say you've got a 12 year old
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   and a nine year old and a seven year old,
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.880]   that you could do something
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   that the three of them might want to do
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.160]   and go to one of those bouncy house places
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.540]   or a roller rink or I don't know,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.200]   go see a soccer team play or something,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.840]   but you could do that
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.440]   and then you're not miserable
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.360]   chasing around a two year old and carrying your infant.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.580]   I mean, that just makes everything so much harder.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.080]   So you might find somebody who,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.360]   you're there with the little ones
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.940]   from one to the time the big kids get home
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.560]   and then you have somebody else come help
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.960]   a couple days a week from, I don't know, three to six
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.080]   and then you can go do things with the big kids
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.220]   and that might help a lot as well.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.960]   - I'm a big believer in that.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.800]   My wife and I figured that out a few years ago too.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.300]   If someone is traveling,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.400]   immediately like great, we're getting babysitters
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   and for exactly that purpose for,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.200]   okay, so I can take an older kid to do something
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.740]   or just have time for herself or time for myself
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.420]   to go do things where you don't have to be,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.760]   it takes a little while to figure that out,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.060]   but that goes really well.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.900]   Also figuring out who the high school kids are
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.740]   in your neighborhood, who are, especially the seniors
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.440]   who are starting to worry about money
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.180]   when they go to college the next year
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.900]   and just, we've done this so many times,
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.000]   setting something up like, yeah,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.620]   like a couple afternoons a week,
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.620]   just come over and take the five year old
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.260]   or the four year old and go do things with them.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.840]   And it really makes a difference.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.480]   And I think people don't always think about it
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.080]   'cause they say, well, why would I have someone
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.960]   come into my house if I'm here?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.160]   And that's like a block people have,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   but it's a one to get past.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.800]   - Definitely, definitely.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.200]   (upbeat music)
