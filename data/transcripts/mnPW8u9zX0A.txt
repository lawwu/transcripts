[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is In Depth, a semi-regular series in which I talk to
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.880]   interesting people about the quest to cultivate deep life. Today's episode is brought to you by
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.320]   our presenting sponsor, Reclaim.ai. This is a product I'm actually really excited about. I mean,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.460]   they use the word deep work when they describe it. So I'll come back a little later to tell you more
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.000]   about that. But what I want to tell you about right now is today's guest, the one and only
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.560]   Mr. Tim Ferriss. Tim, of course, rocketed to prominence with his 2007 book, The Four-Hour
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.660]   Workweek, which basically redefined my generation's relationship with work and meaning and the
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.980]   possibilities for building an interesting life, a major influence on my work for sure. He followed
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.660]   that up with a series of other massive bestsellers, including The Four-Hour Body, The Four-Hour
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.460]   Chef, Tools of Titans, and Tribes of Mentors. Most people probably know him today for the podcast
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.100]   he started right around the time he was wrapping up the four-hour series. It's called The Tim Ferriss
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.280]   Show, and it was one of the first big business interview sort of self-development podcast out
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.700]   there. Some people have called him The Oprah Podcast, and I see why. This show has been wildly
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.880]   successful. It's surpassed more than a billion downloads. Tim has interviewed countless major
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.240]   figures from Jane Goodall to Jerry Seinfeld to LeBron James, and his biggest get of all, of course,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.340]   myself. More recently, Tim put out a card game. It's called Coyote, and he created it with one of the
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.960]   top designers in the game business, the same company that invented exploding kittens. The game is a blast.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.820]   Okay, so given all of these things, what did Tim and I talk about in this discussion you're about
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.060]   to hear? Well, we started with Coyote. I wanted to know why did he build a card game, and more
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.100]   importantly, how does that world work? How do you become the top designer in the card game business?
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.820]   What does it take to really strike it big in game designing, and how is that different than what
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.360]   other people who try to strike it big in game designing don't succeed? What's the difference
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.500]   there? I'm just curious about that world, so we start there, but then we go deeper. Tim and I talk
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.120]   about his path to stardom. We talk about the autonomy and depth he had in his life circa the time when he
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.300]   was writing The 4-Hour Workweek, and then how his own success stripped some of that away, and his effort
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.320]   since then to get it back. We talk about his future plans for his podcast and for writing where he wants
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.920]   to go from here. We really get into some really interesting territory about one of the masters of
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.360]   this topic, how he feels, what he's thinking about, and what he wants to do. This is a must-listen
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.300]   episode if you have any interest in the deep life. Tim really is sort of the OG of the deep life as a
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.880]   concept, and he obviously has a lot of interesting things to say. He speaks from a place of deep
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.200]   deep experience. So anyways, let's get right into it. Without further ado, here is my conversation
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.080]   with Tim Ferriss. All right, Tim, thank you for joining me. Always a pleasure to talk with you.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.840]   Yeah, yeah. Lovely to have the band back together.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.980]   That's the way to think about it. So, I mean, I want to open with the reason why we originally
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.740]   thought about talking, which is you made a game. Yeah, WTF. What's happening here? I'm holding this
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.860]   up to the camera. Yeah. Coyote. Walk us through, just to set the foundation, just give us the basics
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.320]   here, what type of game it is, who you did this with, and where is it, just so we know where we're
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.160]   on the same page. Sure. So the basics are, and there's a lot of backstory, but I grew up kind of saved
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   by games, mostly very complex games like Dungeons and Dragons. I still have all of my materials
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   downstairs from when I was a kid. And I, for a host of reasons, felt like games, analog, social
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:09.880]   is just every year. As kind of digital goes vertical, the counterbalance of analog and social is becoming
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.360]   more and more important. So I thought, you know what? Maybe I should make a game. And it is a fast,
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.780]   casual, social game. Made it with exploding kittens because I became close friends with Elan Lee,
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.860]   used my podcast to sort of test the waters. And they've made a whole host of great games and
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.160]   tested a few dozen games with my friends and came across Poetry for Neanderthals, which is an
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.520]   exceptional game. Maybe it's just by me and my dumb friends, but that's the one they wanted to play over
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.140]   and over again. And I was like, well, who made this game? Oh, Exploding Kittens. Who's behind Exploding
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.140]   Kittens? And that's how I kind of pulled on the thread. And right now, Coyote is,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.780]   it's doing very well. It's got like 300 million plus social views of gameplay online. And you can
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.500]   find it everywhere. Just launched. And it plays three to eight folks, typically. Kids can play,
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.380]   I'd say, 10 plus. So very, very simple to learn, but different every game.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.140]   It seems like it's physical memory. How do you describe this game plan? It's like, okay, so if you
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.340]   have to do motions and the ones and the cards, as the cards come down, it changes what people have to
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.760]   do and trying to keep track of where everything is. And it gets kind of frenetic. So under the hood,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.140]   and all of my books are designed this way as well. There is a Trojan horse with this game. So it has
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.980]   to be fun. And people need to want to tell their friends about it and play again, right? That's
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:47.840]   table stakes. But under the hood, it is also a workout for your brain. And I've spent a lot of
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.400]   time thinking about this kind of thing. But by and large, people are not interested in buying things
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.060]   to make them smarter. I know it sounds crazy, but I've tried this multiple times in the US,
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.680]   at least it does not work. So this has to be a side effect. But yes, it's basically a gesture rhythm
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:14.200]   and verbal game where it's almost like rock, paper, scissors on steroids for a group where you try to
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.600]   match all these things as you go around the table. And if anyone makes a mistake, they lose a life and
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.640]   then last person standing wins. You can also play cooperatively. If you have someone in your family
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.000]   who's a really sore loser or a friend who's just complaints too much. But the competitive mode is
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.880]   really kind of where the smack talking and I think the adrenaline and a lot of the fun is. So it is a
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.400]   rhythm and gesture game where people have to perform an action, say what's on the card, and go around in
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:50.200]   a circle keeping a certain rhythm. And the reason it's called Coyote is because I want people to find
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.920]   their inner trickster if you think of the mythologies around Coyote in many of the indigenous cultures in
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.960]   North America, also in Mexico. I suppose that includes Mexico on some level. But this Coyote
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.040]   character pops up again and again. In every culture, whether it's Loki, Ictomi, or others, there is some
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.780]   type of trickster. And the reason that's part of the game is you can sabotage other players.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.660]   So if you have somebody who's really good at, say, math or music, those folks tend to be very good at this
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:27.180]   game, you can handicap them by slapping them with attack cards and things like that. So that's the game. And
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:35.300]   you can learn to play in a few minutes. But as someone who spent 20 years in Silicon Valley, still also to this
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:44.500]   day, investing in tech startups and everything else, I think we're wading into some very risky waters with a lot of the
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.940]   technological saturation and everything else, which we could talk about. So getting offline, giving people a light
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:57.860]   lift, that provides sort of a little bit of vitamin P vitamin play, I think is, is really, really, really
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:04.660]   important. So I've been playing a lot more games versus just staring at a screen 18 inches away, all day, every
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.340]   day. And that's why I made it.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:14.580]   I'm curious about this world. Because I think about this type of game that you called it casual or fast
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.340]   casual. Is that what?
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.180]   Yeah, yeah. And there are there are lots. One thing I realized and part of the reason this took two years to
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.220]   make is there's so many different. If you say I want to make a game, it's kind of like saying I want to
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:33.940]   start a business. It's like, okay, well, we need to drill down a little bit. So you could call this, I would I would describe it as fast,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.980]   casual, there are other ways to describe it. But meaning, after dinner, you've got an hour,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.740]   maybe a few people have had some drinks, what do you play? If you try to play some of these other
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.900]   games, which are fine games, wonderful games, terraforming Mars, you're never going to get it done,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   right? Yeah. And furthermore, if people are tired, or a little fatigued after a long work day,
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:01.620]   it's going to be hard to recruit people, at least my friends to play it. So so this is along the lines
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:09.300]   of an Uno, or the Monopoly Go card game, something like that. It's closer to that side.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.820]   So because what fascinates me is it reminds me of screenwriting. And here's the connection I want to
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:21.060]   make there is that when you talk to screenwriters, they say, look, people think this is easy.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.740]   Because when a when a script is on the screen, and it works, you're like, I could think up a
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.100]   similar idea for a movie, and I know how to talk. I'm not watching someone drill, you know,
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.500]   Steph Curry drill a three pointer from six feet behind the line like, oh, I can do this. This is
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.940]   a great the alien attacks or whatever. Yeah, a good fast casual game if constructed, right? You're like,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.620]   oh, this is just fun. Like you have some rules, you have some ideas, it kind of goes back and forth.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.180]   But when I talk to screenwriters, they say the issue with the screenplays, everything has to be
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.140]   right. It's a watch mechanism, like everything. And you don't realize a very good way to put it.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.420]   If you introduce like, you know, Chekhov's gun, like you mentioned this here, it better pay off there.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.380]   No dialogue cannot have a purpose like this has to connect to this and even a bad screenplay.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.060]   You have to be a professional screenwriter to have written the bad screenplay because there's a
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.820]   there's a technical complexity that just making a script that everything connects together.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.780]   I assume this is similar for making a game like this. You said two years. So I'm curious about
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.340]   that world, what the world you met with Elon Lee, what you learned from him. What is it like in the
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.860]   world of trying to make a card based game that is easy to learn and fun to play? What goes on in that
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.260]   world to actually make a game like that? Yeah, let's talk about it. And what we're about to talk about,
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:41.860]   right? How that watch is built is part of the reason why I decided to do something completely off menu,
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.700]   completely different from what I am accustomed to doing because
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.620]   I choose and maybe we'll get more into this later, but I choose projects based on the density of
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:58.420]   learning, skill acquisition and relationship development, all of which should transcend that
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:04.020]   project even if it fails. And so the question of how do I win even if this fails is always present in
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.780]   my mind? So with this, let's dive into it. How do you build this watch? And rest assured, whether you
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:20.260]   make a very obviously sophisticated game or a very, very simple game, there's a lot of complexity or there
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.300]   can be in the process if you want it to work consistently. So I've learned so many things from
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:31.380]   Milan. And he's such a sweetheart of a guy and such a polymath. I mean, he'd worked on the original,
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:38.740]   on the Xbox, on Halo, on entirely new genres of games. He's just, I've seen him make entirely new
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.900]   types of games that have not existed in the world before. I mean, but he comes out of video games.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.740]   He comes out, well, let's see, what does he come out of? I mean, he comes out of so many different
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:53.700]   places. It's hard to slap a clean label on him, which I like. I remember I asked him to send me his
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.540]   bio and I was like, I don't even know what to do with this. And I was like, okay, I like this guy.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:08.500]   And he cannot help himself but create games. And also, and I'll get into the kind of the process in a
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:15.860]   second, but games are fundamental to human life past a certain rung on Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.980]   right? I think we, I'm sure you and I could talk about this forever. So it's like you are,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.420]   if you're listening to this podcast, there are many games you are playing in life with rules,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:33.620]   with stakes, maybe with a quitting time, whether you're aware of them or not. So studying games helps
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:41.140]   you kind of peer behind the curtain to see the games everywhere around you and to choose better
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:47.540]   games also. Okay. Process wise, what did I learn? Well, number one, there are a hell of a lot of
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.020]   different types of games, right? You can have magic type games where you're building decks, where you're
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.340]   collecting cards. You could have a D and D role playing game, very, very, very, very complicated and
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:04.180]   involved. Then you have all the way over on the other side, you have some very seemingly, at least when it's
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:12.900]   done right, simple to learn games. And what I realized, at least for me, was number one, just
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:18.500]   deciding on the direction was the most challenging part as a first time game designer, because I was
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:25.860]   involved in every single step of the process, which I'm sure slowed things down for them. And then
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:35.460]   10 minutes of trying to prototype is worth 10 hours of talking. That's something you learn very, very
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.340]   quickly. And what does a prototype look like for a game like this? Yeah, I'll tell you for a game like
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:48.100]   this. Yeah. We applied a bunch of constraints. So I started with and in conversations, we did a number of
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:56.500]   sprints, Elan and I, friends of mine, just as testers, right, as players. And we're trying all sorts of
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.940]   different original games, then we're looking at potentially taking an easier path, which would be
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:08.660]   taking, say, the game that led me to Elan Poetry for Neanderthals, creating a variation of that with new
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:19.300]   rules or a twist on the rules. And ultimately wanted a few things to be true. Because I played,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:25.780]   for instance, chess with my brother, my brother is very mathematically inclined. I'll leave it at that.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.700]   But he always will beat me at chess. And that's annoying, number one. Number two,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:38.260]   he also wants me to suffer through going all the way to the end to get knocked off,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.820]   even if I see very quickly, oh, I just painted myself into a corner. I'm doomed. This is checkmate.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:50.660]   So I wanted to be closer, meaning the game that I would make closer to backgammon or poker than
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:57.700]   chess in the sense that there is a chance for a weaker player to win if they have some good luck.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.300]   And that also came from playing magic with a couple of friends of mine. And I was like,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.460]   this sucks, not because magic sucks, but because they would always beat me, always.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.900]   And I was like, well, this isn't fun. I don't want to play this game again.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.940]   So it was a constraint. And then thinking of other constraints, like, well, what can be
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.460]   prototype quickly? Cards. We could also use chits, meaning something you use to keep track of lives.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.860]   And we played around with a bunch of other accessories. But here's what the first prototype
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:34.420]   looked like. We were doing a sprint, the last sprint, because we had tried sprints over the course of
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.540]   nine to 12 months. And we hadn't found something yet. Because for me, if I'm going to put my name
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.780]   on something, man, I need to be willing to live with this forever, which means it's got to be something
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:52.100]   I'm excited to talk about, which is a high bar for me. And then we decided, look, we're both very busy.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:59.140]   We haven't found something yet. Let's make this the last sprint. We either commit, well, we do commit to
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.740]   either finding something and running with it, or calling a spade a spade. And we're just grasping
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.220]   in the dark here. And it's probably better for us to focus on other things.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.100]   And what are you physically using in a sprint?
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.980]   I'll tell you.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.740]   Yeah, I'll tell you. So the sprint, first of all, just looks like us walking around.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:22.500]   Well, this happened to be in Toronto. So walking along the waterfront, drinking copious amounts
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   of coffee, talking about games. What if this? What if this? What if this? What if this? And the
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:36.820]   breakthrough moment came when I think prompted by either Alon or Ken Gruhl, who is one of the employees
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.100]   at Exploiting Kittens, an amazing game designer. I think it might've been Alon. I think he brought in
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:48.420]   the question and we ended up with a better question. So the question was no longer, what tabletop games
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.740]   have you really liked? He's like, let's broaden that. It could be kickball. What are the games you've liked?
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:01.460]   Any kind of game. And I was very, a little shy because I've got professionals here who can,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:08.100]   who have done also very, very, very, very complicated games, sophisticated, I should say. And I said,
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.740]   you know what, this is embarrassing to say, but if my friends and I have had a few drinks, even if we
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:21.060]   haven't playing rock, paper, scissors, we really enjoy it. These are smart friends. And I was expecting
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.780]   an eye roll, but instead they're like, okay, let's roll with it. Like what, what, what does that look
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:31.300]   like? And I was like, well, what could it look like in a group of say four or five people? And let's say
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.100]   we're only using cards, but we could add in some dice because I wanted that chance opportunity for a
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:42.580]   weaker player to win. So I was attached to dice because I love like the 20 sided die out of D and D. I just
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.660]   really wanted to use the D 20. So D 20, I really want to use the D 20. Now in retrospect, I'm glad
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.500]   that we applied more constraints to use only cards because for instance, exhibit a tariffs. Oh,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:04.020]   adding, adding these components, that's a lot of cost. And we had this kernel of an idea and we basically
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:13.140]   raced back to the kitchen table and had a bunch of blank decks of cards could just be index cards.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:20.340]   Doesn't matter markers and a bunch of accessories kind of looks like a craft shop in a launch house.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.420]   You can imagine he's got every possible little knickknack you can use for making games.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:32.980]   And Ken and Alana and I just sat down and started making cards and tried a bunch of things and
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:42.100]   literally had a V1 for like version one ready to play test in 15 minutes and then tried it.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.900]   Barely worked, but there was like something. So we're like, okay, let's double down on that piece.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.580]   Let's take this other thing out, throw away a bunch of cards or just cross them out and put something
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.220]   different on the card. Try again, try again. So we were able to iterate sitting at a table
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:06.020]   with blank cards over and over and over again for a few hours. And by the end of that weekend,
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:13.540]   I had to rely on Alon in, in, in the sense of pattern recognition and his taste sensors,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.980]   his kind of water feel for games, because I felt like there was something there,
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:24.260]   but Alon has seen hundreds and thousands of games, right? As has Ken. And I was like, what,
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.700]   what do you think here? Right? Like zero to 10 question. I like to ask, right? Zero to 10,
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.700]   no seven allowed. I buy, I learned this from Kyle Maynard who learned it from somebody else, but like
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.980]   zero to 10, no seven allowed. Where do you rate the potential of this game? And don't blow smoke up my
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:46.660]   ass. And I think it was like a, an eight or a nine with the possibility of getting it higher. And I was
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:54.020]   like, okay, if that's true, let's pause for now. Cause we were wiped out, you know, after play testing
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.020]   and especially this game also, if you want to, if you have trouble getting to sleep and you want to
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:05.540]   get to sleep, like play a couple of rounds of this before bed and it might just be easier to sleep.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.900]   I say that as a lifelong insomniac. Um, so we were wiped out and we, but, but there was enough proof
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:17.700]   of concept there to say, okay, let's expand this, make a very, very rough deck and play test it with
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:23.300]   other people to see what happens. Was the motions in the beginning, like the initial play testing,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.420]   was it closer to rock, paper, scissors? Like at first, was it just, Hey, we have different hand motions,
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:35.380]   the details. Didn't matter. Uh, the details didn't, the details do matter, but in the beginning
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:42.740]   and this is again, keep in mind, I'm like this, the, the skier who's been on the, like a couple of
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.900]   slopes six times. So I'm like, tell you, let me tell you all about skiing. Right. Here's what you got
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.140]   to know when you're jumping off a cornice. It's like, what have you, you know, but, but keeping all that in
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.060]   mind, big grain of salt. I have learned a lot. I've taken a lot of notes. I've documented everything. So
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.780]   here's what I would say. The details do matter, but in the beginning, you don't know which
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.860]   details matter. So you just throw a lot against the wall. So we tried tons of stuff. And what Alana
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:11.140]   is very good at doing is, and I'm, I would say I'm not terribly good at this is brainstorming and
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:18.340]   testing without too much judgment, right? So leave the editor aside, right? And no matter how harebrained,
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:26.180]   how boring, try everything. Cause it's so fast to prototype, the turnaround time is so fast with this
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:34.660]   type of game construction that you should just try it and you'd never really know. So in the beginning,
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:41.540]   there were a lot of gestures, for instance, that we ended up pulling out later. Example,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.780]   anything that's kind of not suitable for work, which we're very reliable at getting laughs.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.620]   If you're going to distribute at Walmart and target where you want to, chances are you're
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:57.380]   going to have to yank some of those out. And similarly, some of the cards had people standing
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.700]   up from a table to do something. Well, if you have somebody at the table who can't do that,
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.260]   you've just run into a big problem, right? So yanking those out. Now later you can have
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.500]   expansion packs and you can have print to play PDFs and all that stuff, which I plan on doing.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:16.900]   But there was a lot of vetting. Now, once it goes back to Exploding Kittens headquarters and they're
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:23.140]   playing it internally with employees, then they have an entire system for play testing. They have an entire,
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:30.580]   very refined system for play testing. And at that point, we also were creating spreadsheets with
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.940]   multiple tabs of different gestures, which have corresponding words. So you can change the
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.740]   gesture, you can change the word, you can change both. And we had a ranking system for everyone.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.700]   So we just had hundreds of these things. And what's the data to rank them?
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:52.420]   Yeah. So there was a, there was a, as I remember it, there was a one to three ranking system.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:23:00.100]   And one was, this isn't interesting at all. Two is it's sometimes interesting. Three was it, it,
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.380]   it seems to hit most of the time and get a laugh, right? There were a lot of questions around like,
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.820]   how many kind of laugh out loud cards should you have? And if you only aim for those laugh out loud
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.700]   cards, does that actually handicap the game? Because it makes you kind of deaf to it after a while,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:24.980]   do you want to preserve it for like variable reward? And in addition to that, there are some decisions to
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:32.260]   be made about just, hopefully this doesn't sound boring, but deck construction, like there are 66
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:42.100]   cards. Why on earth 66 versus 86 versus 36? All of that revolves around a combination of
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.940]   variety. Things are color coded because you can play with people's brains in weird ways once you add
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:55.300]   colors. So a certain amount of repetition with colors, deciding which cards to replicate. And it,
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.220]   and it comes down to a lot of probability, right? Like how often do you want certain cards to show up
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:07.540]   and over many, many games, what do you observe and mathematically, what should you see? Which then feeds
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:16.900]   into questions like, for instance, initially we had the game produced where you do what you do with every
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:22.500]   game. You shuffle the deck, right? Yeah. But if you have the gesture cards or action cards, they have
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.140]   salamanders on them. You can explain why they're salamanders on them. There's a good reason for that.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:33.300]   But the, then you have the action cards, then the coyote cards are all grouped together initially. And when
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.940]   you would shuffle, you wouldn't get, most people don't shuffle very well. If you just do a riffle
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.460]   shuffle, it doesn't actually mix the deck that well. So they would end up with these solid groups of
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.860]   identical cards that doesn't work very well. So they're seeing this in play testing, like the people
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.780]   are shuffling not well and they're getting like six salamanders in a row. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.940]   Or six coyote cards or whatever. So then you go back to the manufacturing and manufacturing cards is
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.860]   surprisingly challenging. Like the, the actual manufacturing facilities are gigantic.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:10.820]   They are huge. And there are very, they're relative to many other types of games or things
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:16.580]   you could produce. A few, relatively few of these manufacturers.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.860]   They're in China at high volume. Yeah. A lot, a lot. Most of them are in China.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:27.300]   And same as book printing, basically the same as book printing. And what you can do is off the line,
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.540]   you can manufacture a shuffled deck. So you can indicate what type of composition you want the deck to
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:39.620]   have as a quote unquote shuffled deck. So then when people pull it out of the box, they have a really
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.020]   good first time out of box experience. It's so important. It's like if the first two rounds
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:53.780]   whiff, or they're just meh, that is going to crush you. And particularly since it's like,
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.580]   this thing's cheap, right? It's half the price of a movie ticket, basically in the US, right? It's 9.99
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:05.620]   in or around, around $10, right? So if they play twice and doesn't totally work, it doesn't make
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.020]   them laugh. Are they going to play again? Maybe, maybe not. So you need the out of box experience
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.780]   to be really good. So the amount of time that you spend on the instructions also play testing the hell
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:23.060]   out of that, because once you do the internal testing, then you can go out to families and other
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:29.940]   people you've recruited to play test. And this is also, there's so many parallel parallels with tech
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:37.460]   and any type of product really, I think direct to consumer, but it could be applied anywhere.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.500]   Where if, if for instance, I think usertesting.com might still be around. I'm sure there are better
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.220]   tools now. But back in the day, it's like, if you want somebody to try signing up for your
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:53.220]   software as a service on a website, you could ask them, what did you find confusing? How was it? Or you
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.540]   could just do a screen capture with a video and watch the facial expressions and see where they pause and
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.660]   take too much time. Yeah. So similarly with play testing a game, you don't want to just ask somebody,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.660]   what did you think? And have a list of seven questions. Do you want video of them playing?
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:15.780]   Like, how long does it take certain parts of the game to transpire? Are there, are there huge pauses
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.020]   where people get gummed up? Where do they laugh versus where do they report they laugh? Right? Like,
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:28.180]   these are, these are often things that have huge discrepancies. So suffice to say, to figure out
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:38.500]   a simple game is not so simple. And it has given me so much more appreciation. It's kind of like if you,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   for instance, I'll give people a recommendation. Like I love drawing. I've done, I was very involved
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.900]   with all the artwork for every aspect of this game and did a lot of hand sketching and, and so on.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:55.860]   But if you have somebody take you, let's just say a nature guide, take you on a tour somewhere around
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:02.020]   your house and introduce you to all the tree species, usually easier to start with trees versus
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:08.100]   general plants. Right? So you get maybe like in most places in North America, half dozen trees, maybe.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.260]   And now when you walk through the forest on your usual hike, you're just going to see things
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:20.820]   completely differently. Yeah. Like the fidelity, it's like, boom, things suddenly it's 3d instead of
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:28.420]   green trees, your labels change. And with your labeling change, your reality changes. And the same thing
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:34.740]   happens to me now. If I see other games, I'm like, Oh my God, this is so smooth. And so
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:42.740]   simple for me as the user, right? It's like, if you open any product, let's just say a really
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.860]   well-designed Apple product, cause most people had that experience and you're like, Oh my God,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.620]   to get the, to get the AirPods paired to my phone and to do this and this is so easy. And then you compare
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:57.140]   that with like, I'm going to throw them under the bus, but buying like a brother printer and you're just
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:03.300]   like an hour and a half year later, you're like, what does it take in God's name to get this thing
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.740]   on wifi? So I can, what is this wifi button about? Like there's a feature that no one has ever used
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.900]   this like auto connect protocol that yeah. So you can have this, you can have the same experience of the
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.180]   game where you read the instructions. You're like, I have no idea what this means. Um, so
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.780]   to answer your question, I suppose, yes, there's, there's a lot that goes into it. And then also
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:32.100]   there are things that you can do that translate or can transfer from other places. So for instance,
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:39.220]   I used a bunch of websites and there are a million of them, but I think in Tel Aviv is one pick food.com
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:46.260]   is another where, you know, I created like, I don't know, we created six to eight variations
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:53.780]   of this box in terms of the cover art, right. And then split tested it by serving it to different
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:59.620]   demographics and having them select their favorites, meaning one out of two at a time. And then the
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.580]   winner would proceed to be compared against the next variation. And we did a ton of split testing.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.620]   And just like I did the Google AdWords way back in the day to test for our work and the subtitle,
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:16.580]   you can where possible test with a few hundred bucks, you can get great signal. Not always,
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:24.660]   but often you can with this. It was really clear because the winner was like 10 X, right? The number,
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.820]   like the standard deviations out was so significant. I was like, yeah, this is very clearly. Did you
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:35.780]   predict that or are you surprised? In this case, I did predict it. I have whatever it is. I don't
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:44.420]   know what it is, but from a visual perspective, I think I'm, I'm just maybe a little more acute than
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:50.100]   a lot of folks. I don't know what that is, but certainly my OCD probably feeds into it. I mean,
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.420]   I have been diagnosed with that, which was no surprise. I had to do it as like a formality.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.020]   And the therapist was like, or the psych, the, I guess he was psych, a psychiatrist was like,
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:03.140]   I know this could be a lot to take in if you need to like pause the zoom and come back tomorrow. I'm
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.500]   like, this is not news to anybody. Let's just keep going. I need this for the insurance. Come on.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.100]   Yeah. I need this for the insurance. Let's keep going. But I can draw almost any layout of any
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.060]   restaurant I've ever been in. All right. Like the, just like my, my mind just works that way visually.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:22.740]   So in this case, I was able to, I was able to predict. And I should say also, it's not just data,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.740]   data, data. It's like, can you, if your name is on this goes for book covers too. Can you live with
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:36.420]   this forever? Which is why I sometimes, I guess no longer because the publishers can make pretty good
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.980]   money reliably. So they won't say this, but I was a problem author. Like I was a problem author
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.700]   author because I would fight. I was like, you guys don't have to live with this. Your name is
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.020]   not on this. And I understand the incentives are slightly different, but like, I am going to see
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:57.540]   this so many times. I need to be happy with it. Yeah. And if that ends up being the second choice
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:03.300]   instead of the first choice based on the data, so be it. Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering if there's a, uh,
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:09.860]   drug dealing for fun and profit box that you tested equivalent, referring for the lister back to your
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:17.060]   original title before our work, maybe a coyote with a bloody ma or something that just did not test well,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:28.660]   well, figuring out just the name took a long time. Uh, I tested so many different names and it can become
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:36.340]   just like with book titles, sort of a emotional, not necessarily heated, but it can become a conversation
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:44.420]   based on opinion and you want to test that you want to test. So for instance, one of the counter
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:55.060]   arguments against the name of this game was that coyote is very much sort of an animal of the Americas.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.140]   You know, it's like, let's just call it maybe down into some of Central America, but mostly,
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:07.300]   you know, Canada, us and Mexico. And will people actually, will this mean anything to people in
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:15.140]   other places? And so I had to do a bunch of polling, which I'll very often do with very short social posts
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:21.380]   at very odd hours that hit particular time zones just to see, uh, and also texting friends and so on,
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:29.460]   uh, about this. But then there are, there's so many different variables to land on something
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:39.220]   that finally works, uh, including box design, box size, pricing, uh, negotiating and handling the
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:45.220]   politics of very, very large retailers. Like these are all independent arts in the decathlon of creating a
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:51.220]   game. Yeah. And Alon is just an excellent decathlete. He's good at all of it.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:58.580]   So what's that? This is my, I'm curious about new worlds. What's that industry like? Is there big
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.180]   players? It's a lot of independent players. Is anyone making money? Like what is the game?
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:08.100]   Yeah. What is the game world? Yeah. This does take to a lot of people. Yeah. This might be a good one
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.620]   where we have the Wayne's world. Like do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. And we cut to Alon Lee
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:20.180]   giving an answer. Listen to that podcast episode with you and Alon is probably the, the best answer,
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:25.700]   right? I would say it's, it's a lot like other industries in the sense that you have a few 800
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:32.340]   pound gorillas who are gigantic, you know, the Hasbros, Mattels, et cetera. And they have internal
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.380]   divisions that are doing what like exploding kittens is doing. Like just, just working on game
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.020]   variations. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you'll absolutely. And you'll, you'll have these giant
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:50.180]   within the scope of games. You'll have these gigantic companies that do a lot of things, including
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:58.340]   something like a, you know, the fast casual category. And then you have a ton of, then you have
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.900]   the, the very successful and exploding kittens would be one of the very most successful, let's call it
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:09.220]   more independent game studios that make tabletop games and exploding kids is definitely one of the
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.380]   most successful. I mean, they had one of the most, if not the most successful Kickstarter of all time
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:20.900]   initially with exploding kittens and then parlayed that into creating a real amazing company with many,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:29.380]   many, many best sellers. And then you have a super long tail of let's say independent game designers and
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:39.060]   people who are taking a stab at making a game and those folks almost always will license their game
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:47.460]   to a publisher. It's just like books in a sense and take a royalty because they don't, they're not capable
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:54.980]   of, uh, and, or they do not want to contend with all the logistics of like supply chain management,
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:01.860]   dealing with retailers and all of that stuff. And if you only have say one skew and you're relatively new
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.820]   to the game, it could be the best game on the planet, but just as with book publishing,
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.900]   if you try to approach big retailers by yourself, they are not going to carry your game. It does not
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.100]   matter how good it is. They do not have the infrastructure to handle thousands upon thousands
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:24.180]   of independent contacts. So you'll have brokers, which would be the equivalent of say book agents,
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.540]   right? It's the same, it's the same thing. Yeah, it's the same, same. And that's also part of why I
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:36.180]   like stepping into these realms that seem completely unrelated, but you start to spot things that you
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:42.580]   can conceptually at least copy and paste. The brokers are negotiating licensing deals on your behalf if
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.140]   you're an independent, the bro, those would probably be, this is probably a lot. I'm getting into the deep
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:53.780]   end of my ignorance pool here, but the brokers would help you potentially place even for the larger game
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:59.860]   companies. They would be your interface to someone like a buyer, category buyer at a Walmart or a Target
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:10.740]   for instance. And you would probably need to find representation of some type to submit games to
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:15.140]   larger game companies if you want a little bit of leverage. That could also be an attorney potentially.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.300]   I mean, that's how I lean with any new industry. So for instance, like screenwriting, right? You mentioned
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.140]   screenwriting, like I, that I have, I've had it for like a decade, but I have a screenplay that's like
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:32.900]   80% done. And at some point. You're the only one. You're the only one. Yeah. Yeah, right. Exactly. So
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:43.300]   at some point lawyers are very neglected, right? They get a bad rep in some senses, right? But they are the
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:51.540]   ultimate connective tissue that holds a lot of any industry together. So I suppose what I would say is
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:38:00.420]   that there are these intermediate parties and very often you will need the assistance of one or more
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:07.060]   to get any type of deal done. If you were a part of that long tail, which is another reason why it
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.340]   wouldn't have made sense for me, for me to try to do this solo, my learning would have been much
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:20.500]   flatter. I would have made many more mistakes and I wouldn't have possibly had the distribution would
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.700]   have been, I would say impossible. It's probably a fair word to use. What's the best case scenario for
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.340]   someone's dream? I mean, you're independent and you just stumble across your, your, your play testing
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.100]   with your friends and it's just like a brilliant game, like a tabletop game or something like this.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.220]   Yes. And you have someone approach and it, it, you license it and it hits, right? What,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:44.900]   when we're talking about like the, the blue sky scenarios for someone who's thinking about that,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.180]   what, what are we talking about? Are we talking about someone getting rich or are we talking about?
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:55.300]   That's a great question. And I, I, I can't contractually get into like the details of my deal,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:00.740]   but I would say it's very similar to books. I mean, yeah, it's similar to books. I would say that
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:08.900]   if you have a mega mega mega hit, then you can do well, but they're like an atomic habits of
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.100]   tabletop games. Like you could just something about what you're doing takes off for years.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:21.940]   I mean, those games definitely exist. I will say that I know for a fact, a lot of the game designers
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:32.020]   who have done deals with publishers who later have those games go parabolic and just insane for many
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:43.860]   years in terms of incredible sales seem to like a DIY their lawyering or otherwise a lot of game
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.020]   designers. And this, this is true for anyone who's new to anything, right? It's easy to be
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.540]   penny wise and pound foolish. So I've seen a lot of, let's just call them inventors, right? Yeah.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:59.860]   Cause this is also true in pretty much any product category. And there's a, there's a great book on
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:05.940]   just inventing in general and sort of licensing versus venturing called, I think it's one simple idea by
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   Steven key, Steven with a pH. Who's just, he's created stuff for all these gigantic brands. He does
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:17.220]   almost all of his prototyping with like construction paper and really basic stuff around the house. And he's
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:26.020]   been massively successful, but pay a lawyer to review contracts, pay a good lawyer, like really invest in
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:33.700]   that. Even if you're going to put yourself obviously not dangerously in the red, but that is where you
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:39.460]   want one of the places where you want to spend money, right? If you do that correctly, then yes, there are
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:48.260]   people who can make a, a good living doing this. If your goal is to make billions of dollars or tens
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:54.740]   of millions of dollars, I would not bank on trying to be an atomic habits, right? Like that may be,
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:00.340]   I hope it's not for James. I hope it's, I hope he has 10 more of those, but the magnitude of sales of
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:06.100]   that book might just be a non-recurring phenomenon, right? It's kind of like, I was talking to an
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:12.500]   entrepreneur recently and Taylor Swift wore one of her rings to an NFL game. And I'm like, okay,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:18.340]   you saw this huge bump in sales. You cannot in any universe depend on that happening again.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:23.060]   Yeah. That is, you stumbled across a bag of money. That's exciting, but don't make your
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.860]   business plan stumbling across a bag of money. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Business plan. Step one,
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.660]   pick up bags of money. It's like, ah, that might be hard.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.580]   But if you just keep getting Taylor Swift to wear your stuff, it's a great business plan. What's the
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:42.420]   problem? But I will say that it is possible to make money in games, but you're not dealing with,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:49.300]   say the margins of software. Yeah. Right. And that's just the reality of a physical product.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:54.500]   It's like books. It sounds like it's very similar. Yeah. You can even even, even the price point is
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:01.780]   similar. Interesting. There are very, there are much more expensive games. So if you get into the
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:08.340]   realm of involved strategy games, like there are games that definitely you walk into a game shop,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.180]   there are games that sell for 50, 75 bucks. I mean, you can find those games, right? But they don't
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:17.140]   sell very many. Exactly. So you're going to be looking at, I mean, they can sell,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.460]   but you're going to be looking at, there are always trade-offs. There are always trade-offs.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:29.860]   And my, my goal with this was, and I'm fortunate to be in this position, but it, it, the business can
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:34.660]   work like exploding kittens has done a really amazing job of building a business. It's not a not-for-profit.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:43.620]   So you, so you can, you, you can make money in this world, but the advice, my advice to someone who
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.820]   is thinking they might want to make a game would be the same that advice that I would give to someone
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:53.460]   who's thinking about writing a book, right? Uh, be slightly different. I would say in a, in the case
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.940]   of a book, I'm like, if this can't be your top priority for the next year, from a time perspective,
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.740]   don't do it because you're going to have to live with it forever. And if it can, then consider it.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:11.620]   Similarly, I would say, if you assume that you do not make any money, you don't lose money, but you
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:17.700]   don't make any, is this still worth doing for you? And if the answer is no, I would not suggest doing
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.140]   it. Just like if, if someone said, I'm thinking about becoming a country musician to make my riches,
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:29.060]   I would say, Oh, but if you said, I think I'm going to make an album because I've always loved music.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:36.500]   My friends love my music. And I just, I can't rest knowing I never gave it a shot. Okay. That's a good
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:42.340]   reason. Then give it a shot and maybe lightning will strike and you'll capture it in a bottle. Maybe.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:47.060]   What a fascinating world. Well, let me, okay. So let me zoom out on this a little bit then.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.620]   Oh, can I say one more thing? Sure. That, uh, I have tried more and more
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:57.700]   to immerse myself in worlds where the people are friendly. This sounds so maybe, I don't know,
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:05.300]   like, uh, Mr. Rogers, but some worlds are friendlier than others. Yes. Right. It's just
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.900]   true. So if you go to any of these big trade shows related to games or you go to even like
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:16.740]   Comic-Con, right. To expand it a little bit. But if you go to Gen Con, for instance, I have not yet
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:23.540]   been, but from everything I've heard and in tandem, I'll give another example of archery, specifically
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.980]   bare bow archery, which we don't have to spend a lot of time on, but there are many different
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.500]   disciplines within archery and the, the people in bare bow are the friendliest. They're happy to help.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.260]   They don't have any cutthroat competitive mentality. Generally speaking, like everybody helps
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:43.220]   everybody. That makes a difference. Uh, it makes a huge difference. That's like the neighborhood
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:48.340]   where you choose to raise your kids. Yeah. It's like, where do you want to be? Who do you want to be
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:55.060]   around? Because you are going to be influenced by all of that. And the gaming world, the tabletop gaming
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:01.220]   world, to be clear. I think when the stakes get higher, it gets weird, like video games, then
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:07.780]   there's a lot, uh, the dynamics are very, could be very, very, very different. Just like all the prize
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:12.420]   money for archery or a lot of the prize money is in compound archery. And it's like, things change
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:18.340]   when you start to add in that incentive as a primary driver, right? The people matter.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.900]   Yeah. Yeah. And the incentives matter. It's like the, if you, if you added the same amount of money
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.980]   into bare bow, I'm sure people would stop sharing their secrets. It's the money. Yeah. But you probably
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.780]   have the same experience I've had because we both obviously had a lot of exposure to the publishing
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.660]   world, but also some exposure to Hollywood and like the, that world. And I read the difference,
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.340]   both of them there. It's people are meaning a different way in Hollywood.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:46.500]   It's like, they're satirical, how nice they are to you. And then behind the doors, it's so brutal.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.980]   So like in Hollywood, it's always like, I, you know, I gotta tell you, this idea is so good.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.260]   I would give one of my kids away for adoption just to work with it. You have, I could die tomorrow.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:01.620]   You have given me a reason to live. And then, you know, you never, it's so bad. It's so bad.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.020]   And then you go to the publishing world, dealing with Hollywood. Some I was like, ah,
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:13.300]   New York based agents. They're like almost they're brutal. Right. But at least like they're honest,
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.500]   they're also just as mean, but they're more honest. Like that's a dumb idea and that's not going to work
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.020]   and we're not going to publish it, but at least they're clear about it. So you have different flavors
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.740]   of meanness. Yeah. It's nice to get out of those worlds. I can see that. Yeah, for sure. I mean, the
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:31.860]   and I'll, I'll actually speak to that too, because games have a huge benefit
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.340]   that is similar to maybe standup comedy and here's the benefit.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:46.820]   If you have, you have a passion project, that's music or art or whatever
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:55.060]   for a lot of different types of projects, people can lie to you to be nice. Yeah. Right.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:00.900]   If you get up in front of an audience and try to do a 30 minute set comedy, you might get one or two
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.780]   courtesy laughs, but then it's going to be dead silent and you're going to bomb and you're going
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:11.620]   to know that your material doesn't work with a game. If your game doesn't work, your game does not work.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:17.060]   It really doesn't. You can tell on those big game tests. You can tell. And even if somebody's trying
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:23.620]   to be nice there, they have that kind of plastered fake smile on you're like, Ooh, that's not good.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:27.780]   Right. Or if they're like, yeah, that's, yeah, that's fun. Like the damning with faint praise. I mean,
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.300]   like you can tell watching the, like the colors were great, Tim, the colors, really like the size
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:39.620]   of these cards are laminated, like really smooth. Like really good job. Yeah. So, so a huge benefit
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:46.740]   is you will know if your baby's ugly very quickly and you don't have to ask people for their opinion.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:54.020]   You'll see it. And I would just to speak to the Hollywood piece also, the, and maybe I'm biased,
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.540]   having grown up in New York, uh, people can be brutal and the people who are brutal are not always
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:07.460]   going to be right. But if the idea is truly bad, they just saved you a lot of time by being honest.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:13.620]   If you pay attention to it doesn't mean you should just follow it wrote, but separately,
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:22.820]   if someone's brutal to you and you fold, it means you didn't have the necessary enthusiasm or focus to
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:29.620]   have endurance pursuing that project. So even if it's a good idea, they saved you time because you
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.780]   wouldn't have been able to execute in the longterm on it. Does that make sense? Right. Yeah. If they,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.820]   if they'd been too supportive of a bad idea, it would have been six months later, it would have,
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:44.020]   you would have folded when it got hard. Exactly. Yeah. Or if it was, even if it, even if it were a good
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.780]   idea, that's, I think the thing that I'm very inarticulately trying to convey is that even if it
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:55.940]   is a, the idea could have product market fit for say a book, but the book is going to take you a year
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:02.500]   and a half to write and underneath all of the surface enthusiasm, you don't actually have
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:11.060]   the juice to fuel that year and a half. Yeah. Great idea. But like execution risk, right? Like
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:19.060]   key man risk with, with endurance, the, the agent or whoever it is who insults that book or judges
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:26.980]   it really harshly, if that causes you to fold, you wouldn't have made it anyway. Yeah. And I mean that,
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:34.340]   that gets into some very smoky territory where, when do you listen? When do you not? And my, my very
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:39.540]   brief answer to that is you workshop the hell out of it in advance. You pay a lot of attention to your energy
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:47.460]   levels, if it recharges you or not and know what works before you even get to the agent, right?
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:53.620]   I mean, this is another divergence, but why do you think a nonfiction book publishing people don't
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:59.220]   like, not everyone, but I run into people who want to be writers who do not like the fact that the book
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:05.140]   is bought first before you write it. To me, I'm like, this is great. Like money is a neutral indicator of
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.980]   value. Derek Sivers. Uh, you, you, you don't have to put in a huge amount of effort before you get
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:16.020]   like a very definitive, okay, this could work. We're investing in it. And then, you know, and people,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:21.460]   there's a lot of first time writers who just don't want that to be true. What do you think is going on
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.580]   there? Well, tell me, tell me more about that. So with the folks who have voiced that to you, is it that they
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:34.660]   want to sort of follow the romantic image of the writer, come out of a cave with this beautiful
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:41.700]   diamond and then get what they're worth? Is that, is that the, is that what they hope to do or is it
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.460]   something else? I think, well, here's what I'm trying to figure out. I think it might be,
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:52.420]   it makes the rejection proximate. Right. So it makes it too close when you say to them, oh, great. All you
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:59.460]   need to do is query an agent. You could do that tomorrow. It's maybe it's, I'm not ready for this
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:05.460]   to be rejected yet. I want to have a thousand words a day with, with the perfect, you know,
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.740]   urban matte tea that I Instagram and do this for two years. And I don't want this to be derailed. I
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.340]   don't know if that's, what's going on. And then there, but there's such, I have these conversations
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.860]   with the writers all the time where they invent the most elaborate ways that they're going to get around
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:23.460]   being judged first. And I was like, well, why not just see if the idea, maybe it's their mind knows,
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:27.380]   like it doubts them. I'm not, but it's always a fascinating thing. I was like, this is the huge
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.100]   advantage we have over novelist is we find out upfront. We don't have to wait till the box office numbers.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:39.140]   Yeah. I would say, I think that now that you're explaining it and giving some examples, it's
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:47.860]   avoiding judgment, it's avoiding feedback. And this is where Seth Godin has so many great things to say.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:53.700]   And I can't remember who first said this, but you know, no product survives first contact with customers.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:52:01.620]   And what Seth would say, and I'm paraphrasing here, but he said, you know, changing the world and creating
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:07.460]   this and doing these giant things that you can hide behind the big. He's like, find your smallest
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:15.300]   viable audience and get in front of them as quickly as possible. And then you can't hide, right? If
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:22.660]   getting it, if having three of my friends play test, my, my shitty prototype is, is doable tomorrow.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:29.060]   I it's, it's, it's almost impossible for me to come up with excuses why that isn't something I,
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:34.660]   I can do. Right. But if I'm like, I want to create the game, that's the combination of this,
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.980]   this, this, this, and this bestselling game, it's going to take me nine months. I have a plan and then
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:45.140]   I'll be ready to finally show it, to debut it on the stage at the world expo or whatever.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:51.460]   I think underneath it all. And it's often, I would suspect subconscious people are just afraid
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:59.540]   of it being rejected. And for me, the problem is the label as is often the case, right? It's like the,
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:05.220]   the labels you use and the words you use matter, they form your thinking and your beliefs and your
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:12.820]   reality. So for me, it's just feedback. It's people who are helping me make something better. That's it.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:21.140]   Right. That's it. And that's like having a very rough draft and having people who care about you,
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.380]   who have a good eye, giving you feedback on that rough draft. They are helping you make something
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.620]   better. Now, if you're dealing with strangers, of course, they may not do it in the most delicate
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:36.500]   fashion possible, but nonetheless, they're still helping you get closer to something better. So
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:44.100]   the, the first contact is tough. And a lot of people may not realize, I mean, if you get good,
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:50.820]   especially in the early days at selling nonfiction books, you're basically fundraising for a startup,
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:58.020]   right? It's like, you're putting, you're putting together a book proposal. What is that? It's a pitch
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:06.340]   deck slash fundraising presentation is what it is. And a lot of the stuff you would see for people
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:11.300]   raising money for Uber or anything else. It's going to be the same stuff. How big is the market?
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:17.300]   Yeah. Right. Do you have access to the market? What's the basic premise? Why doesn't this exist
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:22.420]   in the market? Or why does it echo something that's already working? Okay, let's see a sample,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:27.940]   right? Which would be the equivalent of like a super rough mockup prototype. And
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:36.900]   they want to know that it is as close to a sure thing as humanly possible. And then you get this
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:42.500]   advance, AKA like seed funding, right, to get you to the next milestone. And they're like, well, if this
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.220]   goes well, we'll have more to pay you, right, which is paying you in installments. It's the same thing.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:54.500]   Same idea. Whereas fiction, man, that's a tough game. I mean, having to write it first. I mean, that's,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:00.900]   I would prefer to do it, honestly, because the prospect of selling a fiction book, which I could
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:06.100]   probably strong arm someone into doing if I wanted to, right, I could have some publisher cover their
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.420]   eyes and say, I hope you don't get me fired. Right. And like, yeah, I have channel, I wouldn't want to do
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:18.100]   it because the pie on the face would be so much more dramatic. Yeah. If it came, whatever it is,
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:22.500]   six months before this thing supposed to be published. Yeah, I'd rather just have a couple of
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:28.980]   sample chapters. And they're like, Tim, I love you. And this is terrible. But good news. There are steps
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:34.580]   you can take to make it not terrible. And here's like, we love you your book about bare bow archery.
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:39.220]   We get that you're passionate about it. 800 pages. I don't know. Yeah.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:45.060]   Yeah. There's a lot in here about string density or tension or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:52.180]   So tell me if this is right or not. Like if I'm, this is like, I'm putting an arc from afar on your
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.660]   life. So you can tell me if this is, this is right or not, because I've been writing recently about this
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:02.420]   idea. I've been using the term engineered wonder. I had a recent newsletter post about this talking about
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:08.020]   Walt Disney. And there's a certain point in his, his career is post-World War II. The studio was
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:13.780]   struggling. He was in a malaise and he went all in on, he was building a one eighth scale model
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:18.500]   working steam train. He went all in on this for like a couple of years.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:23.460]   And then he shut it down and like came out of that and built Disneyland. But there was like something
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:28.740]   about this activity. He was all in on something. It was like, it wasn't a core. This is the next
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   movie we're doing as our studio or whatever. It like re re-energized him. They sort of got
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.220]   different parts of his brain and nervous system active again that weren't before.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:42.260]   And it led to, you know, all sorts of other stuff as well. And I was making this argument like this is
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:47.620]   important, like engineered wonder, a project you do just because my, my, my two aspects where it's
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:54.020]   fascinating and then you tend, like you take it far. It can't just be, I took dance lessons. It has to be
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:58.500]   like, you know, I, I want to compete and win. It's not just, Hey, I built a game to play with my
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.780]   friends. It's like, I want it. And let's, let's try to go all the way and do it in Walmart.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:10.660]   So it seems like if we're looking at your life pre four hour work week, because in four hour work
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:15.540]   week, you talk about your life, like right before four hour work week, like this period where brain
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.860]   quickened, you stepped away and made it like, I'm going to have a lot more time. You had a lot of that
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:25.380]   going on, right? A lot of the things you document in like your first book was just things that were
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.860]   interesting and you pushed it really far because like life is, I mean, that's, that was the thesis of
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:35.940]   that book. You're doing this now as well. I mean, it's, you know, there's cock punch before that
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.860]   and you have the game and just like things that are just interesting to you, right? Like that, right.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:46.100]   Folks. Yeah. That's what it was called. Everyone knows what I'm talking about. Uh, and there's a lot
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:50.100]   of this going on and it seems like from afar, this is where I want you to tell me if I'm right or wrong,
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.140]   is that there was like a period in between where things seemed maybe a little more grinding.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:58.980]   Yeah. I'm thinking about like when Ryan was working for you, it was like, this book was successful
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.580]   and there's these events we're doing and the books, the new books were taking like forever
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.180]   to write or whatever. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:09.460]   Is there an arc there where like you're returning the engineered wonder or am I simplifying things?
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:15.300]   I want to take a quick break from our conversation to talk about the presenting sponsor for today's episode,
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.060]   reclaim.ai.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:25.220]   Now, those of you who have heard me talk about AI know that my big interest with this technology is not
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:33.460]   these massive vague promises about super intelligent Jetson style robots. What I care about is targeted
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:39.380]   applications, places where AI can solve specific pain points. Now, when it comes to knowledge work,
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.820]   there are a few pain points worse than a calendar that's so haphazardly filled with meetings and calls and
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:52.260]   appointments that deep work or recovery or even just sanity becomes impossible. This is where reclaim enters
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:59:01.220]   the scene. They use AI to solve this specific problem. Now, how does it do this? I want to run over to their
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:05.380]   website real quick to actually show you for those who are watching instead of just listening, because I think
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:12.340]   it's really cool. Jesse, can we load the reclaim.ai website? So here we go. Here's their website. The tagline,
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:17.220]   get your time back with AI. You're talking my language already, but I want to scroll down to the
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.620]   three specific use cases they discuss here. All right, here's the first one. Jesse, there's gonna be
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:27.940]   music to my ears. You're gonna see why I like this. Defend focus time. Protect time for uninterrupted deep
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.780]   work. They're using my language. I love it. They're literally speaking my language in the sense that
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:38.740]   they're using a term I invented. Protect time for uninterrupted deep work so you can achieve peak
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:46.420]   concentration and be up to 500% more productive. You can see on the screen here that you set a focus
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:50.580]   weekly time goal and it helps you change your calendar to meet it. All right, here's another
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:56.020]   use case on here. Optimize your meetings. Use AI to find the best time for your regular meetings and book
[00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:02.260]   new meetings faster with AI power scheduling links. Man, there's a great graphic that came up where there's
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:07.140]   like a grid of available time. You can see it on here now and you click little sections where you're available.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.140]   Other people do the same thing. The AI can help find a group meeting that's going to work for you
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:17.220]   and the other people. The final thing to say here is improve your work-life balance. Say goodbye to burnout
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.620]   with AI calendar controls that prevent overtime, back-to-back meeting days and interruptions. Can you imagine that?
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.900]   A calendar that knows a busy meeting day probably shouldn't be followed by another busy meeting
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:34.260]   day? A calendar that can help you schedule so it's not just you sending all these emails back and forth,
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:39.140]   but instead of just scheduling you whatever random time is available, it actually knows about deep work
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:45.220]   and focus time and recovery. This is AI I can get behind. So here's the thing. Reclaim doesn't
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:52.020]   lock you into rigid schedules. It's AI dynamically adjust your time blocks. Again, they're using my language, Jesse.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:58.340]   I love it. I love it around conflicts and shifting priorities. So you stay protected without sacrificing
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:05.380]   flexibility. The average Reclaim user, get this, gains seven extra productive hours every week.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:11.140]   Cuts overtime nearly in half and sees major drops in burnout and context switching. That is the third
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:17.540]   term I love that they're using. Here's what I think, Jesse. I think I have one of those like split
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.620]   personality Jekyll and Hyde things. And what I didn't realize is that like at night when I thought I was
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.580]   sleeping, my other personality came out and I started Reclaim.ai because they're speaking my
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.180]   language. This is all the stuff I would care about. I don't want to hear about your super intelligent AGI
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:38.980]   that's going to automate half the economy. I want a calendar that's not going to overbook me, that cares
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:45.060]   about deep work, that knows that context switching matters. Finally, a company speaks the right language.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:49.460]   Reclaim it as you use it will be the one thing on your computer that's actually trying to help you do work
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:54.340]   that matters as opposed to actively trying to make it impossible. Like basically every other app I feel
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:59.060]   like I deal with on my computer sometimes. So if you're a knowledge worker, you have to check this out.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:07.380]   So how do you do it? You can sign up 100% free with Google or Outlook calendars. If you go to

[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:35.860]   that discount code CAL20. That's reclaim.ai/cal. All right, that's cool. But now let's get back to my
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:41.700]   conversation with Tim Ferriss. I don't think you're simplifying things. I would say you are simplifying
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:48.980]   things, but you're simplifying correctly. It's the right direction. Yeah. So here's what I would add to
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:03:00.180]   that because I think you're right. I've always, well, let me rewind. I think we can mine a lot of very
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:08.020]   valuable stuff from our childhood and younger lives. Like the obsessions that we never got tired of.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:16.020]   I think there's a lot there, which doesn't mean, oh, I liked My Little Pony. So I'm going to go
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.020]   strike a licensing deal with My Little Pony. But it's like, what is that? What about it?
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:26.900]   Like dig in. And surprisingly often, I've tried this a number of times in the last
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:32.500]   handful of years, that stuff still works. There's like this little genie in a bottle
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.460]   that you can tap if you figure out why those things did what they did.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:42.740]   Things when you were young. Yeah. Like really captured you. Really captured you.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.660]   Feelings of locked in fascination. Yeah. Fascination dragons when you're
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.780]   12. Obsession, losing track of time. Yeah. Those things still work. So for instance,
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.820]   the last few years, I wanted to be a comic book penciler forever. Meaning I wanted to draw comic books,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:06.340]   like Marvel stuff. And I used to get lost in art for decades. And then when I graduated from college
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.660]   and I got, you know, serious job and I was like, okay, that stuff's for kids. Let's move on. Like
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.340]   focus on the real stuff, read books by Richard Branson and this and that, the other thing. And like, yeah,
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:26.420]   put on some blinders and what I realized over time is that those activities, those, those like time
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:33.700]   passing without you realizing it kind of loss of the self, like the fixation on the self dissolving away,
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:43.300]   those aren't optional frivolous things. And I would maybe compare them to like the,
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:51.620]   I don't know the coal, like furnace room in a gigantic ship. It's like the energy that is produced
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:57.540]   from that preserved and produced, right? Just like the recharging and everything that that room provides
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:02.420]   is necessary for the entire ship. It's not compartmentalized in that one area.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:08.020]   So when you find something like this, which doesn't need to take a long time, honestly,
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:15.140]   for me, it could just be screwing around with the tutorial on YouTube with Procreate on an iPad and
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:21.700]   doing, you know, 20 minutes of drawing at some point after work, just to bookend work, right? The,
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:29.380]   like the shutdown complete, right? Uh, now typically if I do 10 or 15 minutes, it's going to turn into an
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:35.460]   hour and I'm gonna be like, Oh my God, I'm hungry. I totally forgot that I was doing this. And that is
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:41.940]   like an extra four hours of sleep. It's incredible how much energy you can derive from that. And so I
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.340]   would say like four hour work week, another way to chart the course would be like four hour work week,
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:52.740]   which was about, let's just call it like per hour productivity. How do you maximize that? Right. And then
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.700]   for our body, once again about performance, but everything physical
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.100]   for our chef confusingly to a lot of people, actually a book about accelerated learning,
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.780]   right? So, but once again, it's like, how do I do more with each minute? Basically
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:14.900]   then started extending into tools of Titans and tribe of mentors where we get a little more philosophical.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:19.860]   Maybe that's me getting older. I think it's me also realizing how much with every passing year, like
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:28.500]   how few things really matter. Again, any possible way you could assess it, but certainly just in terms
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:35.940]   of quality of life, relationship quality, the things that make humans human. And so I had the philosophical
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:41.700]   kind of stoicism angle, right? It was writing about stoicism and, and other schools of philosophy
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:52.420]   starting maybe let's call it 10 years ago. And the missing piece was just this engineered wonder that
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:07:00.500]   you're describing, right? I touched on edges of it. This, this engineered wonder awe in the last few years,
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:06.500]   like really paying attention to awe and what it does to people. There are some very interesting
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:14.020]   discussions of this in the scientific literature and achieving that in a number of different ways,
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:19.220]   right? Immersive nature with very close friends, which I'm doing next week, literally taking a week
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:25.380]   completely off the grid up in the mountains of Montana with a few friends, learning wilderness survival
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:37.700]   skills, carrying stuff around all day. And then also play. And I think play, play sounds frivolous to a
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:42.100]   lot of folks who are like, I still have places to go things to do. And I guess my point would be like,
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:51.700]   play feeds into productivity. If I, if I need to present it in a way that is palatable to type A people like
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:57.620]   myself. Right. It's it's that engine room in the ship, like a former right-hand man wrote a book
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:01.780]   about that. Yeah. Charlie's book. I remember exactly that to me. It's an influential book.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:09.460]   Play, play it away. Yeah. Charlie on. Yeah. So, and, uh, it doesn't need to, it doesn't need to distract.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:18.340]   It honestly preserves and fuels you so that you can be actually better at discerning what matters. I think,
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.340]   like if you don't have time to meditate for 10 minutes, if you don't have time to play a game
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:29.300]   for 10 minutes, like you need to take a full week and sit down and do some hard thinking and journaling.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:38.020]   Right. Yeah. Uh, because that is basically a preview of burnout and implosion, I would say,
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.700]   based on my, my lived experience and the lived experience of a lot of people in my audience.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.980]   Uh, and we, we could certainly talk about a lot of other elements, but I do think the,
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:54.180]   the, the engineered wonder, the play, the joy, the awe, which are kind of, I would say
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:02.340]   kind of the ends of the spokes feeding back to something central that is, is kind of the same
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:10.980]   thing. It's like a constellation of all of those is incredibly valuable. And if you get a little,
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.780]   this is going to be a big word folks, sorry if this sounds overstated, but like transcendence. And all I
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:25.220]   mean by that is you stop the me, me, me, I, I, I song for 10 or 15 minutes. Oh my God. Can that be
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:35.380]   like just a revelatory experience that you can build into your life. And with all of the powers that be
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:45.780]   and teams that exist every time you open your phone to exploit the me, me, me, I, I, I song to make you
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:52.740]   use these things incessantly. Yeah. I, I really think you need these moments where you are not fixated on
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:58.340]   the self just for, for S for self-preservation, but also just to enjoy this. As far as we know,
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.420]   one way ticket ride that we all have. I mean, is there, it seems like there's an irony
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:07.620]   that like you, you, you wrote a book trying to explain to people, because you're talking about
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:13.380]   many retirements. It was to go have these moments. Yeah. Like, hey, get the helicopter ride up to the,
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:20.260]   the wine country and, you know, Argentina, Argentina, right? Like go to do the, the tango dancing, you
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:25.060]   know, there's like, right. But write a book to tell people about this, right? Like you said, yes, it was
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:31.140]   about getting more out of each minute, but on behalf of reducing the footprint of work. Um, right. But then
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:35.940]   this seems ironic, but maybe I'm just misreading. It's a little bit ironic that writing a book,
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.100]   explaining to other people, Hey, here's what I'm doing. I'm getting all these moments. My life is
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:44.820]   built around these moments of like transcendence and like engineered wonder the success of that book,
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.660]   then like took a lot of that out of your life because now it's like, I have to write the next
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.660]   one and I want to try TV and let me try this, but let me try this instead. Like, it seems like,
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:56.660]   I don't know if that's quite right, but like the ironies of the professional world
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:04.580]   is you're so successful telling people about the joys of it that they took away your time to
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:12.740]   keep doing that. I think that's true for anyone who is successful in anything
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:21.860]   to the extent that they get noticed in any way. It could be, it could be as a chef,
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:28.500]   it could be as a writer, it could be as a coder, as a programmer, like a really good UX designer.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.940]   The thing that you love doing, right. To come back to that endurance, right. You're not only good at it,
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:41.860]   but you really enjoy doing it, which gives you all the fuel, the endurance to outlast other people who
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:46.660]   might have hypothetically the chops, but they don't have the, like, so you've got the, you've got the
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:53.940]   love, you've got the ability, you're really good at doing something before you know it, you're going to
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:12:01.460]   get more attention and you will almost inevitably get pulled away from that thing. Right. So if you,
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:05.460]   if you're the, this is just an example, it's really common in startups, but it's like, if you're really
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:10.340]   good at that thing, boom, before you know it, you're a manager. Yep. And then a few years later, you're
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:16.420]   gonna be like, how did this happen? My whole week is meetings. Yeah. I'm not doing the thing I want to
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:22.340]   do, but if I wanted to be an independent contributor, like I'm going to have to take this big cut in my pay
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:28.740]   and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. And then you have golden handcuffs in a way with authors very frequently.
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:34.740]   I'm sure you've seen this before. It was like, you, you, you've create this thing while nobody's
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:40.900]   really paying attention to you. And then all of a sudden the floodgates open. And we chatted about
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:45.780]   this before recording a little bit, but this is why I have this 800 page draft, please shoot me now,
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:51.380]   but of a book about all the ways that you can say no. And the strategies I've used for the last,
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:57.380]   whatever, almost 20 years, I didn't have that toolkit because I didn't have the problem of
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:04.260]   this huge paradox of choice in the same way. So what did I do? Just like many authors, I was like,
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:10.740]   you're going to pay me to talk for 60 minutes. Hell yeah, I'll do that. And just said yes to everything.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:15.380]   And then you end up this like traveling salesman, like George Clooney. And what is it
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:22.740]   up in the air or whatever that movie is? And you realize this sucks. The thing that I, that I,
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:29.300]   that I was good at, they got me here. I no longer have the space to do because as I mean, you're kind
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:35.780]   of the, the archdeacon of deep work, right? You can't cobble together half hour here, 45 minutes there
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:40.340]   to get what you would get after out of a half day or a full day of writing. You just cannot
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:49.300]   do it. At least I haven't met anybody who can do it. And so then becomes right. The great divestiture,
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:55.540]   figuring out how to get back to these things that got you there in the first place without getting
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.220]   distracted by, and you're going to get distracted. So it's, it's kind of like meditation. Like your
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:04.180]   monkey mind is going to be like, yeah, email porn. Here's calendar. Like the, the argument you had
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:07.780]   with your ex 20 years ago, whatever, like your mind is going to do that. Well,
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.900]   if you could combine email calendar and porn though, I think you have a startup.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:16.260]   I think you got a unicorn email hub premium. So
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:21.460]   that stuff's going to come up. But the point that I think it was Sharon
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.540]   Salzberg who made this point to me, she said, maybe it was Tara Brock. I can't remember, but she said,
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:32.660]   it's, you're not trying to eliminate thought. Every time you take the fishing rod and reel yourself back
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:38.260]   from those thoughts to your breath or whatever, that's a rep. That's like doing a bicep curl.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.660]   It's like, you're going, you're going to get distracted by shiny things, everything.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:51.300]   At least once you set foot in this like attention UFC, that is digital, anything
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:57.380]   you're going to get distracted. So the question is, how do you reel yourself back in? How do you create
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:06.260]   scaffolding and systems? And, and you're right. So I have, I have at various points been pulled away.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:11.940]   That's going to happen. So it's just a question of how you get things in your calendar
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:20.660]   that actually matter. Right. So for me, it's like one group dinner a night with, it seems to be like
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:28.100]   three plus friends, but not too many, like, let's call it like three to six people total, huge quality
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:35.860]   of life. Yeah, huge, huge. Like I can't even put any kind of number on it and get the, if they're not in
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:41.860]   the calendar, they are not real, like get them, get them booked, get the people committed. And so you
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.020]   can't back out with some lame ass excuse. Cause you're like watching an extra Ted talk that you
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:52.340]   don't need to watch or whatever. Right. Yeah. You're on your calendar, porn, email, calendar porn.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.300]   Yeah. Well, can I, I kind of want to get your help on this. This is, this is when I would probably at
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:02.020]   three of the, probably at two in the morning, you know, like in the middle of the night tonight,
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:09.460]   I'm going to buy yet another useless domain. It's going to be huge just in case before this
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:14.260]   podcast comes out. One of the most popular things out there. Well, I feel like you're ahead of me on
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:19.060]   the divestiture, right? Like you, you got more serious about this. I don't know when you would
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:22.740]   say you got more serious about it. It's why I liked that you were, you were working on this concept.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.780]   I feel like right now in my life, I call it the, I'm the great disappointer. And I feel like you,
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:33.940]   you went through this, there's your next book title because the way people, which is natural.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:39.220]   The problem is it's, it's asymmetric for like an individual who's asking you for something.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:44.100]   They're simulating just the time commitment of the thing they're asking you about. And when seen in
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:48.740]   isolation, it's like often reasonable, or as you was speaking, the reward is really high. And in
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.620]   isolation, they're like, I don't understand why you want it. It's 60 minutes and it's some absurd amount
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:59.540]   of money. Or it's like, can't you just come by our company and just like talk about deep work for a
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.620]   while? Or let's just meet up and have a coffee. Yeah. We have a coffee. Yeah. You know, in isolation,
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:08.740]   it's nothing, but then it's asymmetric because there's 30 of those coming in and then that's all
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:14.420]   you're doing. And so I feel like my speaking agent thinks I'm clinically insane because like, I just,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:17.620]   I'm like, I don't want to speak. I have like the worst speaking client. I was like, I'll do three
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:23.220]   times a year. Right? Like I, I just, I just say no to everything. Uh, all of our like extended circle,
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.220]   it's like all friends of friends are always like, why can't you just come talk about deep work? You
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.380]   know? And I'm always like, I just, I can't, or like, I'm just saying no to everything, but it feels,
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.100]   it feels sort of, uh, haphazard. When did you're like, when did you switch to the great divestiture?
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:42.900]   Like at some point, I S yeah, I started, I, it, it took different forms. So I'd say the,
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:53.540]   the great divestiture in terms of figuring out strategies and tools and systems for saying no,
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:18:01.060]   or simply not seeing categories of things that I have decided I need to say no to even for a limited
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:05.060]   period of time. And you do full categories. It's just easier. It's just easier.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.940]   I have a policy, right? No speaking for six months, zero. And if you break your own rules,
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:15.940]   all is lost, right? Like you can't, because here's the beers. And this is going to get into some woo,
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:23.140]   like a Venice slash Topanga hand wavy stuff. But my experience is as soon as you set a policy,
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:28.660]   like no speaking for six months, the best offer you have ever seen is going to come through the doors
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.540]   in two weeks. So you can almost like trick the universe. Like, yeah, you just have to be,
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.020]   and you just have to say, not today, say not today. And you gotta say no.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:42.420]   Yeah. I mean, and this is literally true. Like I literally, it just makes me think about it,
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.900]   getting, you know, an offer from a Sultan. Yeah. And that sounds like a made up thing,
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.500]   but actually I was talking to a couple of someone else who had the same offer come across. That's
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:55.540]   the type of thing that comes across. We like your book. We're bringing you out. You can like dance for
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:59.620]   us and you know, whatever. And I just keep saying, well, keep adding zeros till you say no,
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:02.580]   like that type of stuff. So I said no to that. I say, but this is why my speaking agent thinks
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:07.140]   I'm crazy, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not moved by money. Okay. Yeah. So whole categories.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.940]   You should write a book called tactically insane. Maybe that's the next one.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:17.220]   And, uh, I mean, it just brings up the G to Krishnamurti quote, like it is, it is,
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:21.700]   is not the indicator of health to be profoundly adjusted to a sick society, something like that.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:28.820]   Right. Uh, and so in the beginning it was figuring out systems for saying no, because it was, it was,
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:36.020]   it was literally just like, how do I stop drinking from this fire hydrant or like, how, how do I just
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:42.980]   get out of this flow? Because currently the inbound is so overwhelming. That was, that had to start
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:52.820]   around 2008. Now, given the, the book came out April 20 2007, it took a while to get to, I mean,
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:59.140]   it hit the New York times right away, but tickets number one took until August. And then as soon as,
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:04.260]   is that happened, then all the offers start coming in and then you pay the piper like six months later,
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:10.260]   six to nine months later. And then I was like, oh my God, is this my life now? Wait a second. It's
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.940]   like, it's a quality problem, but this is also in some ways like a very, it's a creative, it's a
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:22.580]   creatively terminal problem, right? Like if I keep doing this, my creativity, my flexibility,
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:31.140]   my identity becomes fixed if I keep doing this. And that's, so it wasn't until later,
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.420]   I tried to find ways around it, tried to find ways to massage what I would say yes or no to.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:42.660]   Okay. I'm going to add, I'll keep adding zeros until people start saying no, all those things can help,
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:50.740]   but they don't, they don't provide the psychological reprieve and the energy benefits of just categorically
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:55.060]   saying this is a no, which I also did for other things that have been like the most lucrative
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:00.260]   thing in my life, angel investing. In 2005, I was like, why I'm taking a long startup vacation or in
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:04.980]   parentheses, why does it know, how does it know when it matters most? And I stepped out kind of at the
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:12.100]   peak of my powers in Silicon Valley to stop completely for three to five years, probably.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.580]   Yeah. And that's what allowed me to really focus on the podcast.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.380]   Did you get a reprieve when you said break from books?
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.980]   Oh, huge, huge, huge, huge. Yeah. Huge reprieve.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.140]   If you could just like not pitch a new book, was there something psychologically different by actually
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.940]   like saying to yourself, I'm not working on, I'm not just waiting to pitch something next. Like,
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:36.820]   I'm not writing right now. I'm doing the podcast. And frankly, for that, that was, I may not ever
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:42.500]   write a book again at that point. I was so burned out from, and this is partially my fault, certainly,
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:48.340]   but committing to do what should have been a three or four year book in a year, a year and a half. I
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:54.180]   mean, it was an insane deadline for this book. I'm so proud of that book. But if people look at it,
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:57.620]   I was, I was thumbing through it. I still use the four hour shelf because it's got a lot of,
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:01.300]   a lot of great recipes in addition to all the accelerated learning stuff. And I was flipping
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:07.620]   through it and I was like, what was I thinking? Yeah. This like four color hundreds and hundreds
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:11.780]   of photographs, maybe a thousand plus with a brand new publishing house. Yeah. Brand new publishing
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.340]   house upsetting the entire world of publishing, going through Amazon publishing a boycotted by everybody.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:22.420]   And I decided what was in BitTorrent involved for some reason for some of the promotion. Well,
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.460]   every time I do promotion, I try to learn something new using a brand new channel or something.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.140]   So we did a BitTorrent bundle, which was actually super successful with a
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:35.780]   free audio version of the four hour chef and all this other stuff. And this is something like
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:41.380]   my kids generation would like those words mean nothing to us. Yeah. Yeah. Torrent a BitTorrent bundle.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:44.980]   Yeah. They're like with, you know, launching the game, I'm going to have one or two kind of
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:56.900]   just, uh, completely off menu, new technologies I'll play with to learn about them and saying no to
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.060]   doing another book, just saying, you know what, I don't know how long this pause is. Maybe it's
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:10.020]   indefinitely was incredibly important also to not to address the isolation and loneliness that I felt
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:16.740]   because even in producing that book, a lot of it, as you know, is very solitary. It's very, very,
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:22.820]   very, very, very solitary. And I spent so much time alone working on that book. It wasn't good for
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:27.940]   me. And I don't think it's good for most people to be alone all the time. Very few people have,
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:33.700]   I would say the mutation. It's not an evolved capacity. It's like Robert Caro, like some of the
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:39.300]   great like historians who just want to be David Grant at the New Yorker. He wants to be in archives.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.500]   Yeah. Just like turning pain, but it's, it's a very specific thing.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:48.100]   I mean, that is, I, I, I really feel like, and sure there are people who are like, I've been reading so
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:52.820]   much Buddhism. Like it's, you just need to be at peace with yourself and talk about your childhood and
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.500]   forgive your parents. And then you can be alone and be happy anytime with yourself. I'm like, maybe,
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:04.020]   but if you talk to evolutionary biologists, like I think evolution drives a lot and genetics drives a lot.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:12.740]   We are evolved to be social period, full stop. And if like Robert Caro by any measure is a complete
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:17.620]   mutant, right? It's kind of like, if you're like, well, LeBron James can jump that high. Like, yeah,
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.940]   yeah. I mean, I should be able to jump that high. And you're like, let's hold, hold on for a second here.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:29.460]   I mean, you are not the same, barely the same species. So similarly, after that, the biggest
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:37.460]   psychological reprieve was spending time with more people and the podcast was intrinsically social.
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:42.580]   Yeah. It was having conversations with people I deeply cared about in the beginning. It was close
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:49.140]   friends and then people I was, uh, whose, whose work or lives I was deeply interested in. Yeah. It was,
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:53.140]   it had a social piece built into it and it doesn't have the footprint on the rest of your life.
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:59.300]   Yeah. Book writing. I'm writing a book now. It, it, you know, I, I'm never not writing a book,
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:04.420]   but man, it gets brutal because it wants it. You want every moment of your life that you're not
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:09.380]   writing. You're a little bit worried. I probably should be writing. Cause that's, that's the thing
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:16.020]   about writing, which is it's, it's so for instance, right. With, with coyote, with this game, it's like,
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:23.060]   yes, because of the way my mind works, I thought about it a lot while doing other things, but books
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:30.180]   are a different level of preoccupation and not preoccupation necessarily in a negative way. But
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:36.900]   when you are not writing, if you're taking a book really seriously, you are consciously or subconsciously
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:44.420]   thinking about the book. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it is kind of an all consuming thing,
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:50.260]   at least in my experience. And it sounds like it to, to, to, to a greater or lesser extent your
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:55.380]   experience as well. But it has to be, it's like, you can do the math. It needs about X number of
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:26:00.740]   thousands of hours of concentrated attention to generate enough words for the book. So like you just,
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:05.380]   you're, you're in the red massively when you start writing a book and like, I have to,
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:10.900]   this needs 10,000 hours of attention or whatever the actual time is. And so it's a, it's not just,
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:16.100]   oh, it's, um, in a degenerate way occupying my mind. It really shouldn't, it's distracting me by showing
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:21.540]   it. It's like, no, it like needs, if I don't get another 50 hours in this week on this, I'm kind of
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:27.060]   falling behind, like how it has to have making my cortisol go up, just listening to you. You can
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:32.740]   tell I'm, yeah, you're, I'm on, I'm on a New Yorker deadline right now. So like I had to take a step
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:37.220]   away from my book and it's stressful every day. I'm like, these are days I could be writing
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:42.340]   glutton for punishment. Yeah. You should get your Opus day whips out and just do that while you're
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:47.380]   sitting. I've got the thing wrapped around my leg right now. Yeah. I was asked to do a speaking thing
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:53.380]   for Opus day once that this is the, I mean, back in the early days in Cambridge. Yeah. Wild. Okay.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:57.860]   Interesting. Uh, if you haven't seen the Da Vinci code movie, you can get a preview. It was exactly
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.020]   like that. Yeah. It was exactly what I was very much like Tom Hanks in that movie.
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.660]   It was an albino who was whipping himself. It was an odd, it was an odd, it was just him. It was a weird
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.460]   speaking of it. It was just two of us in a room, just in a room hitting each other with whips, but uh,
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.300]   good money though. So, you know, yeah, you know, but the money was so good. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:20.500]   I remember BJ Novak, who's famous from the office, writer, director, actor, extraordinary.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:26.420]   And one of his tips, this helped me to say no to a lot of stuff actually was
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:31.380]   effectively, I'm paraphrasing, right? This podcast was a long time ago, but whenever you say
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:35.540]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But the money's so good. Whenever there's a,
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:42.740]   but the money's so good or some variation of that, that is a clear red light. Stop and take a really close
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:48.660]   look about whatever it is that you're considering doing. Yeah. If there's an and it's different.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:53.060]   Yeah. And the money is also really good. And the money happens to be great. That's a different thing.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:58.580]   The money is so good. Podcasting seems like the, at least it was, and then I'm going to ask you if this
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:04.180]   is changing, but like, it seems like the, the perfect refuge from that, right? Because for whatever reason,
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:10.660]   unlike these other industries, you could just podcast and be good at it and successful at it. And people are
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.940]   happy to listen to your show and there was no one, no one, not, there's no scaffolding of people
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:19.700]   knocking on the door and be like, great. Now come do this time consuming thing or that time. It could
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:26.660]   just exist as a creative skilled thing where people were just happy for you to do this creative skill
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.500]   thing. There's just not that many people, you know, you have to deal with like ads or something like
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:36.420]   that. I mean, so did you find, I've loved it about podcasting is that no one else bothers you.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.500]   Do you think it's still that, is it going to stay there? I mean, I'm curious about your trajectory
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.260]   because you were there early. Like, are you stick, are you sticking around in podcasting? Are you
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:47.940]   changing? Like, well, how do you, what's your read? You got to help me here. What's your read on what's
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.740]   happening in this industry? What's your relationship to it? Like, is it still going to be this great refuge for
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:57.700]   people like semi-introverted creative people like us? I think, I think, I think it will be, uh,
[01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:08.420]   it can, it can continue to be a refuge, but I think it requires setting rules and policies that you've
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:14.420]   thought through very carefully, at least in my case. So I found myself getting pulled into the floats and
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:22.100]   jets of all sorts of things and then put out, and this is one of the benefits of having a blog, by the way,
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:27.620]   anyone can have a blog, but you put out a public policy, which depersonalizes saying no to a lot
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:31.700]   of people. Cause you can just say, Hey, I put this up six months ago. I got to follow my advice.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:36.500]   Cause you have an interview show. So everyone is probably saying, yeah, can I come on that?
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:41.540]   Exactly. And so I put up, you know, some new rules for podcasting to keep it interesting,
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:44.900]   something like that and explain, it's like, okay, here are the rules I'm going to follow.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:51.780]   And I was actually literally just having a conversation with one of my, uh, employees who's like the,
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:58.260]   the COO producer of editorial handles a lot of the podcast logistics and we had a possible guest,
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.140]   great guest,
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:07.300]   but a list celebrity and has been on before amazing conversation.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:13.940]   but the rule that I set in that new blog post was I'm not doing book launches anymore. I won't be one
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:22.980]   of 20 podcasts that come out the same week and because it's, it seems redundant. And what I will do
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:30.740]   though, like if I'm going to consider any book I need to, I need to record and publish three months ahead of
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:38.660]   publication. And that rules out a million people because they don't have the necessarily the forethought
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:43.380]   to do that or they missed the post or whatever, but I can still point to it. And in this particular case,
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:51.620]   this is, this is an amazing guest who is incredibly good in conversation and at telling stories on
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:57.300]   podcasts. I mean, a plus plus plus, but they were definitely not going to do me any favors. So it would
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.580]   have been at the same time as everybody else. And I said to my producer, I just said, look,
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:07.300]   if I show people that I am not following my own rules, no one's going to respect my rules.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.660]   Yeah. And rightly so.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:13.380]   They're like, look, you had, you had Brad Pitt on during the F1 launch, like everyone else.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:20.420]   So like now you can have me on the talk about my ebook, whatever it is. And which is not to
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:27.620]   cast aspersions on anyone or what they're doing. But for me, it really comes back to like, for me to
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:36.900]   continue to have the energy and the love of the game to do this long term, I just for myself realized I
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:42.660]   need to change a bunch of different rules. So another one was, for instance, I want to have
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:49.620]   a barbell approach to most guests on the show, most guests on the show, which is sort of everybody knows
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:55.300]   them or almost no one knows them. Right. You're trying to stay away from like the, the very highest point
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:32:04.340]   of the, of the bell curve distribution there. And these are kind of arbitrary in a sense, but
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:12.260]   that's rules. And sometimes there is no perfect line that you can point to. So you have to pick a line.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:19.220]   This is true with moral judgments also and ethics, right? Like sometimes it seems arbitrary, but often
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:24.660]   it's always going to be arbitrary. So you must pick a line so that you can make decisions. And
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:32.420]   it's, it's, it's a hell of a thing. Podcasting, I think will continue to be a refuge. If you want
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:40.500]   to play in the major leagues using video as a growth engine, then there are a lot of compromises compared
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:48.180]   to what you are, you and I are accustomed to doing. And many of those compromises would require doing
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:52.980]   things that are completely antithetical to my reasons for starting and enjoying a podcast in the first
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:59.460]   place. So I have accepted that I'm going to make, this has been true for probably a number of years,
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:07.860]   significant economic compromises and growth compromises in order to continue doing this,
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:15.060]   the way that I enjoy doing it. And what that means is I think for a lot of podcasts
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:21.460]   that are not fixed location, TV shows, right? If it's like to call them podcasts now, it's even kind
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:25.620]   of silly. There is an audio component. Yeah. They're TV shows that have an audio feed
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:28.500]   for people who want to just do the audio.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:36.660]   uh, I think it will return to some of the early days, right? It'll be, it'll be more like
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:48.180]   20 17, maybe 2016 for a lot of folks. And I'm totally, I'm totally fine with that. I'm totally fine with
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:56.100]   that because I love having these conversations. And I, I, the only thing that grows without restraint is a
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:34:01.380]   cancer. So you gotta be careful which like professional cancers you choose. And, uh, that,
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.420]   that isn't to say you can't have something very big that is very good. You can, but in my particular
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:14.260]   case, I need to be very personally interested in whatever we're talking about. Yeah. At least that's my
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.420]   bar because I have all these other things. I don't need to do the podcast. You know, it's like,
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:22.260]   I've got the angel investing and the book writing and the game and I'm going to try all sorts of other
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:27.220]   harebrained stuff. I mean, you're about to become a billionaire. You're going to get that card game
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:34.740]   money to get that bank. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Scrooge McDuck backs backstroking through my, my pool of gold
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:43.860]   coins. Um, and it's, it's this, this is also the, my assumption with any of these projects, whether it's
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:49.220]   the podcast, right, which I gave myself a graceful exit from if needed. When I started, I just told
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.980]   my audience, all right, I'm going to try like six to 10 episodes and see how this goes. And I expect
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:57.620]   I'll learn these following things, even if I shut it down. Same thing goes with the game. It's like,
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:03.300]   I have no idea what kind of doors are going to open, what type of email are going to come over the transom,
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:10.980]   what type of opportunities might kind of present themselves in one way or another. So if you were to ask me,
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:15.060]   what are you doing after the game? I have no idea. I have no idea. I mean, I'll continue doing the podcast
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:20.100]   because having these conversations, right, seeing your face, having this conversation,
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:28.180]   just again, coming back to evolved what we have evolved for. It's like, it's very nourishing for me, right?
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:34.260]   Like I'm in a good mood. And that's why you care so much about making it sustainable for you. So you can keep
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:38.500]   doing it. Like that's the plan is like, you're continually looking for some kudzu has grown in.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:42.980]   Let's trim that off because I want this to be able to keep going. What is a kudzu?
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:49.300]   It's an invasive plant that has like native to the like American South that has sort of taken
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:54.100]   over a lot of places, maybe like barnacle on the side of the sailing ship. Like you're like,
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:59.860]   I got to get those off so this can keep moving. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I really think about
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:07.380]   pruning as much as adding, I love Japan. I, my first time ever outside of the United States was
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:13.220]   as an exchange student when I was 15, going from Long Island to Tokyo, which completely shattered my
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:19.460]   mind in a great way for, for, it took a long time for me to get used to being in Tokyo, but
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:28.020]   shoot the Japanese aesthetic, uh, to paint with a broad brush of some of these gardens where you'll visit
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:32.340]   some of these gardens and you'll see someone on the ground with toenail clippers basically
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:39.300]   pruning away at moss, which is not to say that's what I want to do, but what you remove mattering as
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:49.220]   much as what you add. I like that. It appeals to me, the, the, the, the, not because it's minimal, but because
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:57.780]   it's elegant, like I love elegance in every possible form, whether it's calligraphy, whether it's art,
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:02.660]   like a Frank Miller, for instance, legendary comic book writer and artist, one of the
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.580]   few people in the w yeah, actually. So yeah.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:12.180]   Yeah, that was Alan Moore. He, so Frank, he had like a dark Batman or something at some point.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:17.780]   Yeah. The, the dark night he did since city 300 since city is what I was thinking. He's got tons and
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:23.460]   tons, but one of the few people to be a top five writer of all time, let's just say, and a top five
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:31.540]   artist. That's unheard of. And his style has gotten more and more economical, but economical sounds like
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:36.980]   you're selling widgets. It's become more and more elegant. Like what he can transmit with fewer lines
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:40.900]   has become more and more powerful. Do you think this is possible with podcasts?
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.220]   You're saying you want to get like, what is the core like for you? It's like, is it, if it's the
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:50.340]   conversation, there's the, some platonic ideal of like the interesting conversation, like, let me carve
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.220]   everything else out of it. Like we don't need a camera on a boon. Yeah, totally. Which I've been on
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:38:05.300]   those shows before. Yeah. And frankly, um, I, you can just, uh, the, listen to your inner animal too.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:15.940]   It's like, what pleases you? It seems maybe primitive, but I mean, our biology has millions of years of
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:24.100]   fine tuning pre language. So, so just paying attention to that, like, this is super fun for me.
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:29.140]   So if, if I'm, I'll probably sit down and have some tea after this, maybe do some journal and be like,
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:35.540]   okay, why was that fun? What was it? Right. It was cause Cal's a sweet, swell, smart guy. Like that's,
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:40.580]   that's definitely part of it. Not to, not to, you know, buddy you up too hard, but it's like, that's a part of
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:46.340]   it. And we have some, we have quite a bit of kind of shared history. So that's a piece of it for sure.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:53.540]   Uh, you also see things, observe things that other people often don't, right? So the trajectory that you
[01:38:53.540 --> 01:39:00.340]   pointed to like that discussion I haven't had before and the list could go on and on. Like maybe it's time
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:08.660]   of day. Okay. Like before getting reactive with any kind of inbox or anything, I did this. I happen to
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:13.780]   think that's really important. I'm also creating something before I do any management, right? So
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:22.740]   making before you manage for me psychologically, psycho emotionally, huge, huge thing. I don't feel
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:28.500]   like I'm just slapping duct tape on holes in a ship or putting out fires, right? This is something else
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:36.100]   entirely like this. And so paying attention to that and then testing, okay, let's follow these rules.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.540]   Right. And I put in the blog posts of my new rules. I was like, yeah, I could revise these at
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:44.100]   any point. If these are dumb, if they don't work, yeah, I'll change them. It's your life.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:50.500]   I'm going to do something similar with the podcast where we're just in our talking about timing and I'm
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:55.700]   time of day is very relevant because I'm realizing, I think the best time for me to record my show where
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.340]   it's just monologue, it's like, I think it needs to be at the end of the day because I was finding
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:06.420]   like, okay, you have a show. It's like midday. I'm prepping. We record. I can't do anything else
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:12.580]   after that. I don't want to do anything else. I can't go into my email inbox after that or whatever.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:15.860]   And so it was like crushing days. I was like, actually, this should be like the end of the day.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:20.900]   Like we record above a restaurant. There's kind of like an energy to it. And then you can just be like
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:26.180]   done with work. And I was thinking like, yeah, that's the whole point is like with this medium,
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:30.900]   make it the way you want it to be. Yeah. How should it be? It should be like one day a week. It should be,
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.300]   do it in the evening. It should be, we decompress at the bar downstairs, whatever it needs to be like,
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:44.020]   why not? It's something we can still own. Yeah. And, and also just interrogating what rules you are
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:51.460]   playing by that are, that you can completely alter. Like what rules are you currently following? Let's
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:57.300]   start there. And how can you play with them? Do a two week experiment. And, and you and I have landed
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:02.100]   in the same place, by the way, with in your case, kind of the monologue, but in my case,
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:09.860]   it's like, there's a reason why, you know, we're doing this conversation morning, like my time and
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:18.260]   your time. And then I'm recording my own show later as a bookend at the end of the day, because I know
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:25.700]   like this is my show and doing my show can be energizing, but there's a lot of heavy lifting
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:33.540]   also. And particularly if it's very technical, this is going to be a researcher and a, and a professor and,
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:40.180]   and ophthalmology, it's going to be very technical, uh, practical, but technical. So I know that after
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:44.580]   that I'm going to be, that's like after doing a VO two max workout or something, I'm going to be
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:50.420]   spent and that'll be a great place to just like wipe the sweat off my brow and have a snack and
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:54.820]   jump in the pool or something like that at the end of the day. So let's take the order matters.
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:42:01.620]   And, uh, over time you can just pay attention to like how your body feels. Are you excited to hop on?
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:07.780]   Like I was excited to hop on and see and catch up and just riff because I knew that it would be also
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:10.980]   unexpected in terms of direction, which is fun for me.
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:15.300]   Not as excited as you'll be for the ophthalmologist though, because that's going to, that's going to bang
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:15.940]   right there.
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:20.980]   Well, do you know, not to be an ophthalmologist. So I guess I should, I should eat my words.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:26.260]   Yeah. And this also not to turn this into a, Oh, woe is me. You know, I remember back when we were
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:33.300]   youngsters, but, uh, very personal interest, right. For the last year, for the first time I've had presbyopia,
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:39.460]   which is age related visual decline. Um, also interestingly, cause I looked it up cause I was
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:44.900]   like, is that the same as Presbyterian, like the etymology? And it is Presbyterian is something like
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:52.980]   governed by the old governed by elders. So the actual word origins are related, but, uh, presbyopia,
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.940]   it's like, okay. Like looking at my phone, looking at supplement bottle, the looking at a menu and dim
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:02.180]   light, all of that has started to go. And I'm like, I don't like it. I don't like it. I do have some glasses,
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:10.260]   but I. Welcome to my life. Yeah. I don't want to immediately hop to that. So. Oh, super. You're,
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:15.700]   you're swimming against the current here. I was just complaining to my wife before I got on the air here.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:21.220]   I literally said I was at a cop, my, my coffee shop down the block trying to read a book. And I was like,
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:26.740]   it's too dim in there. I was like, I can't read that. It's too dim. I laugh because it's sad and it's
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:31.300]   true. And it's also has been my experience. Well, I'll tell you something crazy, which it could be
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:38.500]   placebo effect. So I don't want to get too ahead of myself, but I've been, I've been experimenting with
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:46.420]   software from this tiny startup and it is intended to train simplifying it here. But instead of doing
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:53.860]   anything to your eye structurally, it's training your visual cortex to, to reinterpret information
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:44:02.100]   and to improve your reaction speed in ways that actually change your near vision and have only been
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:11.540]   doing it for 26 days. It's like eight minutes a day. It seems to be helping. It seems to be helping,
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:15.780]   which is, and it's different from visual education where you're training the muscles in the eye.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:22.500]   This is what I've heard about. This is, this is training your brain. So super interesting. I tell
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:28.100]   you what, I realize I'm swimming against the current, but this is also kind of what I do.
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:32.500]   Right. I get my Tim, this is like Tim Ferriss. Yeah, this is peak Tim Ferriss. I get my kicks out of like,
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:41.860]   okay, I am going to go all in and then I'm going to find all this stuff. And I need someone to tell me if
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:46.980]   I am being a crazy person. So this interview is actually happening. Okay. So I, so I get,
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:52.660]   so I get somebody on who can be like, that's interesting. That's nonsense. Further studies
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:57.140]   needed, but like trial data, actually pretty interesting. Don't do this. That's a terrible
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:00.580]   idea. You're actually going to blind yourself if you look into whatever, whatever for 20 minutes a day,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.540]   don't do that. And that's great. So, okay. All right. Well, now I will look forward to that.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.980]   Yeah. I'm bringing the adults into the room.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:11.700]   All right. Fine. Final question. What's your, have you found this because you've been
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:16.500]   at this longer than me, have you found the sweet spot for staff size? What does it take to run?
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.940]   I know it's confusing because you don't just podcast, but what does it take to run,
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:28.020]   you know, um, Tim Ferriss allied conglomerate? Yeah. Tim Ferriss, uh, international allied media,
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:38.420]   HQ. Yeah, exactly. Uh, I think that I am excessive in my fixation on leanness and elegance. I think,
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:46.500]   I think sometimes I overdo it actually often I overdo it, but what I can, what I can say is what
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:52.900]   currently works for me after a lot of testing. Uh, and I will also preface that by saying,
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.500]   I think I am,
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:02.180]   and, uh, maybe this for another call, but I think I'm a very good leader, but a very mediocre or average
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:11.780]   manager. Right. So I really require people who are incredibly self-sufficient and self-driven and who
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.860]   have a lot of self-inquiry, which often requires a lot of self-awareness. And those people are just
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:24.020]   very, very, very hard to find. Uh, but you can build them, uh, from starting with simpler tasks and then
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:28.340]   cultivating that if they have the raw characteristics, you break them down psychologically.
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:33.940]   No, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss. The training center you have, the
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:42.020]   reeducation center. Yeah. Please relinquish your phone. Uh, so currently I have three full-time employees,
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:52.660]   uh, and a lot of contractors and I have tried to contract out as much as humanly possible.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:47:00.180]   So this will certainly have echoes of four hour work week, right? So my staff size compared to my
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:10.980]   business has not scaled proportionally. Uh, what I will say is contractors have, and people might say,
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:15.460]   well, what's the difference? Well, if you live in the U S there are a lot of differences here.
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:19.220]   Yeah. There are a lot of differences and you have to be very careful with this. You can't get cute and
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:25.060]   have full timers who are classified as contractors. You don't have to be doing. Yeah. You don't want to do
[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:33.220]   a specific thing. It is clearly hourly. It's yeah, but I am, I am willing to, and I'll put this in quotation
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:40.500]   marks, overpay hourly for contractors. I am especially willing to overpay for
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:49.780]   for let's just say companies where you don't have any, uh, single point of failure. Let me give an
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:48:00.180]   example. So there's, um, I use an outsourced sort of fractional family office, which handles all of my,
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:04.900]   right? So there's, there's an annual various annual fees and so on, but they handle all of my bill pay.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:13.540]   They handle all of my effectively bookkeeping. They handle, uh, they can give feedback on
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:19.460]   investments. Some considering I can just float tons of stuff to them that they have a first pass on.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:25.140]   And what's nice about that, as opposed to having a single contractor,
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:29.780]   I, you know, before we started recording, I was like, let me put on some backup audio.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:36.900]   Right. And I'm recording on QuickTime just in case. So I am excessively hyper vigilant
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:42.980]   and the military has this expression, or I mean the military, but you'll get the idea. Two is one and
[01:48:42.980 --> 01:48:46.340]   one is none. It's like, if you have, if you have two, you're going to lose one. If you have one,
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:53.060]   you're going to have none. So always have redundancy. And I've been in a position before where
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:59.460]   do you have a key function? Let's just say it's for the podcast could be sound editing,
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:03.860]   could be video editing, and you have a fast turnaround for whatever reason, and somebody gets sick.
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:11.380]   If you don't have a backup, you're in a scramble and in a bad situation. So particularly with something
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:16.260]   that is mission critical, like bill pay, if somebody gets sick, I want to know that my
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:21.940]   profile my information is within a system and a company such that there's a backup person.
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.140]   Yeah, someone can pick it up and do it.
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:28.020]   Who can swap in and handle it. So I'm particularly willing to overpay for that.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:38.340]   And I think part of that is that I've seen the employee tail wag the dog in some cases, to borrow
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:46.420]   from the tax expression, where people hire, hire and hire, maybe it's during like a 2020 boom cycle,
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:54.820]   because there's a company that benefited from that, or who knows, they start adding folks. But then they
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:50:00.340]   run into the discomfort and possible complications of firing. So they don't want to fire. So they start
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:06.580]   inventing lots of things to keep people busy so they can, in their mind, justify the salaries they're
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:15.620]   paying. Yep. And I try to avoid putting myself in a position where even subconsciously I can be
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.940]   influenced by those types of incentives. Yep.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:24.660]   So on the payroll you're going to invent work and then suddenly you have, you know, you're doing live
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.620]   shows and you've got, you're selling t-shirts and.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:35.060]   Exactly. Exactly. So to try to avoid that, I really apply constraints, right? The beauty of constraints,
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:40.980]   whether you're writing a book, creating a game or building a company, guess what? Like Derek Sivert
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:45.620]   speaks on this really well with respect to CDBA, but it's like, this is your chance to try to create
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:51.540]   your version of a utopia. It sounds maybe ridiculous, but it is, right? Like there's, you have to do
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:56.740]   certain things, checks and balances and dot your I's across your T's from a legal perspective, from a health
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:01.620]   insurance perspective, et cetera. But there's a lot of room to do things in an interesting way. I think,
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:07.860]   you know, Jason Freed and DHH at 37 Signals do a great job with this. Maybe they renamed it Basecamp.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:14.900]   Yeah. So they, they have some incredibly innovative ways of approaching things. Then you see like a
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:20.980]   Coinbase and like what they did and public pronouncements and kind of excluding discussions
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:27.860]   of politics from the workplace. Like you can do a lot within your company. So for me, just like my house,
[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:33.220]   just like hopefully my books or podcasts, it's like my company is a reflection of my personality
[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:38.580]   with its strengths and almost certainly with its, you know, with the, with its weaknesses,
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:44.500]   I try to cover for them. Uh, I, I think I try to make it perhaps too aggressively like a bonsai tree.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:52.580]   Maybe I would benefit from having an extra person or two. Uh, but I have recognized my, my hyper aversion
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:58.580]   to waste means that I will also try to invent things for people to do if I feel like they have too much idle
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:03.540]   That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So contractors won't make you do that. Yeah. Three employees. Okay.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:08.420]   Yeah. And that determines what, um, what I can do or not do. Yeah. But, but also
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:16.340]   that leads me to more productive solutions. Like if I had 10 people who, uh,
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.980]   let's just say a number of them were kind of off cycle and had a lot of time,
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:24.740]   I might have tried to do a game internally. That would have been, I don't want to say a disaster,
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:29.060]   but it would, I would have wasted so much time. Everybody would have been learning from square one.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:32.660]   And instead, because I've applied the constraint of keeping the company small,
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:37.220]   it was like, no, let's go collaborate. Let somebody else who does this every day,
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:40.980]   who's a plus at it, do that stuff. Yeah. Otherwise you would not that this,
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:44.340]   he loves this, but it wouldn't be good for you. And I, you'll end up with like Brandon Sanderson's
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:50.980]   warehouse. And Brandon Sanderson loves having that business. I find it insane. I've talked to,
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:54.740]   I don't know him, but I know some of his people, but it's, he loves it. And I'm like, oh my God,
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:53:01.860]   it's my nightmare. Yeah. He loves it. Like that's, that's part of his art. Yeah. And I recognize that
[01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:08.980]   I, uh, he also has in his wife and other people, folks to run a lot of the logistics and other aspects.
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:14.740]   Yeah. One thing I recognize about myself also is I have a tendency to metal. This comes
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:19.940]   back to being an average manager. Yeah. You're not gonna be happy with that. I get my hands,
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:26.020]   I get my hands dirty often when I probably should just leave everything alone. I'm like maybe an
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:30.980]   executive chef who's like running from station to station, like, ah, come on, come on. I'll let me
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:34.180]   cut those terms. That's the right place to put the sauce. Come on. Yeah. It's just like, you know,
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:41.780]   I got to recognize that this, uh, this OCD thing is, is sometimes very helpful, but also leads me to make
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:49.700]   some pretty dumb decisions. So I try to, uh, Charlie Munger would often say, and Warren Buffett too,
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.660]   right? It's not about being super smart. It's just trying not to be stupid, not to be dumb.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:59.940]   Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. Well, Tim, maybe that's a great place. That's a great piece of advice to,
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:05.060]   to leave it on. Don't worry about being smart. Just try not to be stupid too often. Yeah. I always
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:09.300]   appreciate you take, I always appreciate our conversations. I feel like we do them both places.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:15.700]   It's, it's, uh, it's always, it's always a pleasure and I'm, uh, enjoyed it and coyote coyote. Yeah,
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:21.940]   it's everywhere folks. Amazon target, Walmart, wherever. So hope you hope you try it. It's, uh,
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:28.180]   it's, it works. People laugh. It's, uh, it's a, it's a dumb game for smart people.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:33.780]   So check it out. And, uh, always nice to spend time together, Cal. All right. Thank you, Tim.
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.660]   Thanks man. All right. So there you go. That was my conversation with Tim Ferris. We started talking
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:43.780]   about his game. I actually have it right here. Here's coyote. And we went from how do you build a
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:49.860]   game that is really good to playing the game of life in a way that's going to give you real meaning and
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:54.820]   depth. I have, have you tried this yet, Jesse? I did. You brought it to the beach. Yeah. You took one
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:59.140]   of the copies. Yeah. Fun, right? Yeah. It's fun. I like it. It was really cool to hear from Tim.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:04.420]   How hard it is to get one of these games perfectly calibrated. That was the cool part where you have
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:09.380]   like the, the prototyping and it's just you tweaking this. What if we change this card to this card to
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:12.500]   that card? It's one of those things you think it's like, oh, I could invent the card game. You realize
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:17.540]   like, oh my God, it's so hard to make one. That's fun. Um, this is a good one. Tim is always fantastic to
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:23.220]   talk to. He's a team thinker. He sits and he thinks, and he cares about living deeply in a shallow world.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.780]   To me, that is what the four hour work week is about before our work week, as much as any book
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:33.380]   probably helped set those seeds in my thinking about crafting a life that matters and it's enjoyable
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:38.580]   and that you enjoy as opposed to just pursuing a particular goal or a single grand accomplishment
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.500]   that you think is going to solve everything. So I always enjoy going on Tim show and it's been a
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.700]   pleasure to have him on mine. So thank you, Tim. Check out his podcast, the Tim Ferriss show,
