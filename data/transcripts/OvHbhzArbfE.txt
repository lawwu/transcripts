[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.980]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.000]   School of Medicine. And now, my conversation with Dr. Matthew Johnson. Well, Matthew,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm a huge fan of your scientific work,
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.420]   and I'm eager to learn from you. Likewise. Big fan and happy to do this with you.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.480]   All right. Well, thank you. My first question is a very basic one, which is what qualifies a substance
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.420]   as a psychedelic? Nomenclature is a real challenge in this area of psychedelics. So, starting with the
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.240]   word psychedelic, it just, if you're a pharmacologist, it's not very satisfying because that term really
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.500]   spans different pharmacological classes. In other words, if you're really concerned about receptor
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.600]   effects and the basic effects of a compound, it spans several classes of compounds. But overall,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.280]   so it's really more of a cultural term or it does have a relationship to drug effects, but it's at the
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.260]   at a very high level. So, all of the so-called psychedelics across these distinct classes that I
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.260]   can talk more about, the way I put it is they all have the ability to profoundly alter one's sense of
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.380]   reality. And that can mean many things. Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.760]   acutely. So, when someone's on the psychedelic. So, the different classes that can be the specific
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.720]   pharmacological classes that can be called a psychedelic are one that what are called the
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.020]   classic psychedelics. So, in the literature, you'll see that term. And hallucinogen and psychedelic are all
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.940]   have traditionally been used synonymously. I think there was a little of a tendency to stay away from
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.900]   psychedelics of the baggage, but there's been a return to that in the last several years. But the
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:19.300]   classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens are things like LSD, psilocybin, which is in so-called
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.540]   magic mushrooms. It's in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine or DMT,
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.940]   which is in dozens and dozens of plants. Mescaline, which is in the peyote cacti and some other cacti like
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.060]   San Pedro. And even amongst these classic psychedelics, there are two structural classes. So, that's the
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.980]   chemistry. There's the tryptamine based compounds like psilocybin and DMT. And then there's the
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.380]   phenethylamine based compounds. So, these are the basic two basically building blocks that you're
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.500]   starting from, either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure. But that's just the
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.700]   chemistry. All of the, what's more important, or at least to someone like me, are the receptor effects.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.380]   And then ultimately, that's going to have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.660]   effects. So, all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonists or partial agonists at the
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.860]   serotonin-2A receptor. So, subtype of serotonin receptor. Then you have these other classes of
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.060]   that you, compounds that you could call psychedelic. Another big one would be the NMDA antagonists. So,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.340]   this would include ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan, something I've done some research
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.900]   with which folks might recognize from like robo-tripping, guzzling like, you know, call syrup.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.420]   A large overlap in the types of subjective effects that you get from those compounds compared to the
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.620]   2A agonist classic psychedelics. But then you have another big one of MDMA, which really stands in a
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.460]   class by itself. So, it's been called an intactogen. What does that mean? It means like touching within.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.020]   It sort of eludes to the idea that it can really put someone in touch with their emotions. It's also
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.380]   been called an empathogen, meaning it can afford empathy. So, I get the impression that
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.980]   the psychedelic space is an enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.540]   Right.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.820]   Meaning, some are impacting the serotonin system more than the dopamine system. Others are
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.860]   impacting the dopamine system more than the serotonin system.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.100]   Given that the definition of a psychedelic is that it profoundly alters sense of self,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.260]   at least that's included as a partial definition.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:52.100]   Mm-hmm. I think of psychedelics as profoundly altering models. You know, we're prediction machines,
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:03.860]   and so much of that is top-down. And psychedelics have a good way of, loosely speaking, dissolving those
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.060]   models. And one of the reality…
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.260]   Can you give us an example of a model? Like, I know that when
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.100]   I throw a ball in the air, it falls down, not up.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.300]   This might sound extreme, but there are these cases. It was overblown in sort of the propaganda
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.860]   of the late '60s, early '70s, but there are credible cases of people, and it's very atypical, of
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.060]   sounds like they really thought they could fly and, you know, jump out of a window. Now,
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:41.140]   far more people every year fall, I mean, who knows, you know, they fall and die out of, you know,
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.340]   from height because they're drunk, you know. So, this is extremely rare. But, you know,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.180]   there are some, like, pretty convincing cases. There was one research volunteer in our studies
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.780]   that she looked like she was, in one of our studies, like, she was trying to dive through
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.700]   a painting on the wall. She was fine, but she, reviewing the video, it looked like
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.580]   she really thought that she was going to go through that painting, and who knows?
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.900]   - So, she was- - In the other dimension.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.860]   - Yeah. So, they're violating these predictions. The reason I ask it, the question the way I did,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.660]   is because given the enormous cloud of different substances, and given the range of
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.140]   previous experiences that people show up to a psychedelic experience with,
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.260]   I feel like the ability to extract some universal themes is useful, especially for people who haven't
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.540]   done them before, right? - Yeah.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   - Who might not have an understanding of what their effects are like. Can we just briefly touch on
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.980]   the serotonin system? - Mm-hmm.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:55.300]   - So, compounds like LSD, lysergic acid, diethylamide, and psilocybin, my understanding is that they
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:05.460]   primarily target the serotonin system. How do they do that at a, kind of, general level? And why would
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.060]   increasing the activity of a particular serotonin receptor, or batch of serotonin receptors, lead to
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:19.300]   these profoundly different experiences that we're calling model challenges, challenging pre-existing
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.500]   models and predictions? - Yeah.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.940]   - I mean, at the end of the day, it's a chemical, and these receptors are scattered around the brain with
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.780]   billions of other receptors. - Yeah.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.740]   - What do we think is going on in a general sense?
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.500]   - Yeah. Yeah. And this is really the area of active exploration, and we don't have great answers. We know
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:45.220]   a good amount about the receptor-level pharmacology. Some things about post-receptor signaling pathways.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.580]   In other words, just fitting into the receptor. Clearly, you know, serotonin itself is not
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.780]   psychedelic, you know, or else we'd be tripping all of us all the time.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.820]   - Because when I eat a bagel, I get serotonin release, right? - Uh-huh.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.580]   - I mean, there's— - And it's very different than LSD.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.660]   - Or turkey. I mean, there's triptophan, right. - Mm-hmm.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.060]   - My understanding of serotonin is that in very broad strokes, that it generally leads to a state of being
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.980]   fairly—it pushes the mind and body towards a state of contentment within the immediate experience.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.740]   Whereas the dopamine system really places us into an external view of what's out there in the world
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.020]   and what's possible. - Yeah.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.700]   - Is that fair to say? - Need to do something.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.740]   I mean, that's consistent with my understanding.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.980]   And I'll certainly not in terms of—I don't primarily identify as a neuroscientist.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.580]   I'll definitely tell the, you know, the viewers that we're far more in your domain here than mine,
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.700]   but in terms of how psychedelics and other drugs, you know, interface at the neuroscience level.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.660]   - Well, feel free to explain it at the experiential level.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.820]   - Yeah. - I mean, it doesn't have—let's say I were to come to one of your clinical trials,
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.020]   because these are clinical trials, right, at your lab at Hopkins.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.340]   - Yeah. - And would I need to be depressed,
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.220]   or could I just be somebody who wanted to explore psychedelics?
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.340]   - We've had studies for all of these. - Okay.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.700]   - And a number of other disorders.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.340]   So healthy normal studies—the code for not a problem to fix, but we're all—
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.700]   that's what's amazing about psychedelics, though, because if you administer them under this model,
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.500]   and you develop a relationship and give a high dose of psychedelic,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.060]   you can be a healthy normal without a diagnosable issue, but, man, we're all human,
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.620]   and the issues seem to come to the surface. - Sure, yeah.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.140]   - So, but we've done work with smoking cessation, so people trying to quit tobacco and haven't been successful.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.820]   - So, a variety of reasons. - Right.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.060]   - So, maybe I'll just ask some very simple questions that would kind of step us through the process.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.620]   So, let's say I were to sign up for one of these trials, and I qualified for one of these trials.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.860]   I'd show up—you said I would do several hours in advance of getting to know the team that would,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.620]   that would be present during this psychedelic journey.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.020]   - First, there's screening, so it's kind of like a couple of days of both psychiatric,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.260]   like structured psychiatric interviews about your whole, your past, and symptoms across the
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:04.900]   the DSM, the psychiatric bible, to see if you might have various disorders that could disqualify you,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:09.140]   like the main ones being the psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, and also including
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.020]   bipolar, so the manic side of bipolar. So, so after that, and also cardiovascular screening,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.940]   heart disease, after that screening, then the preparation where you get, you're both,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.740]   you get, you develop a therapeutic rapport with the people who are going to be in the room with you,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:32.100]   your guides, but you're also then didactically sort of explained about what the psychedelic could be
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.740]   like, and that's kind of a laundry list because they're more known by their variability.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.500]   You could have the most beautiful experience of your life, or the most terrifying experience of
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.940]   your life. So it's this kind of laundry list of like the things that could happen, so there's
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.900]   no surprises.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.340]   - I think it's so important for people to hear because you really can't predict how somebody is going to
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:59.620]   react internally. Let's say that somebody passes all the prerequisites, and it's the day.
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:07.300]   Comes the day that they're going to have this experience. Are they eating mushrooms like you
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.460]   hear about, or are they taking it in capsule form, and how do they get it into their body?
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:18.020]   - So they receive pure psilocybin. Most of our studies are looking at where we want a psychedelic
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:25.540]   effect are in the 20 to 30 milligram range. The session day itself is not full of, for most of our studies,
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.020]   is not full of tasks. We really want to look at the therapeutic response. Obviously, if it's a
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:36.100]   therapeutic study, we want it to be a meaningful experience. And research has found, not surprisingly,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.620]   that you get a less meaningful experience when you're in an fMRI, or when you're doing a lot of
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:47.380]   cognitive tasks. So our typical therapeutic model, which again, isn't just limited necessarily to the
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:54.020]   therapeutic studies where we're trying to treat a specific disorder, is to have that preparation.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:12:00.740]   So the person feels very comfortable with their guides. I mean, ultimately, what I tell people is
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:09.220]   like, any emotional response, it's all welcome. I mean, you could be crying like a baby hysterically,
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.780]   like that's what you should be doing if that's what you feel like.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.940]   - I mean, you're doing therapy for people. This is, it's not just about the experience.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:22.420]   - Right. And the experience itself is very much shaped by that container, by the environment,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:27.780]   and the degree to which one allows it to happen. Like one should let go of control.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.420]   - The letting go of control is an interesting feature, actually, because one of the common
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.500]   themes of good psychoanalysis or psychotherapy of any kind is that there's a trust built between
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:45.540]   the patient and the analyst and that relationship becomes a template for trust more generally and
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:51.460]   trust in oneself. How do you convince people to go further and further down that path? What do you
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.780]   think allows them to do that? Because I think that that to me is one of the more unusual aspects to
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:04.020]   psychedelics is that normally the, the social pressure, but also just our internal pressure
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.940]   from our own brain is pay attention to many things at once, not just one. Is that-
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.300]   - Especially these days. Yeah.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.340]   - Exactly. - Multi-task, yeah.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:18.260]   - Multi-task. And the more that we focus on one thing, the more bizarre that thing actually can appear to
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.300]   us, right? - Right.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.740]   - I mean, even if it's the tip of your finger and you're not taking any psychedelics, you spend a long
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.140]   enough looking at the tip of your finger, you will notice some very weird things, right?
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.980]   - That's, I think of that as the classic psychedelic effect or one classic effect and one I've used many
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:40.340]   times of this example of why people shouldn't necessarily, you know, these aren't, these,
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.220]   one should be judicious in putting themselves in these circumstances. Someone could be, you know,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.460]   having a very strong psilocybin experience and they're trying to navigate their way in
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.740]   Manhattan crossing the street and they might be staring into the hand and real like that's,
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.740]   their hand is the most amazing miracle. Like the entire universe has essentially conspired to come
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.660]   to this one point to make this absolutely breathtaking. It's almost like, I think of the simplest form of,
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.780]   of, of what we know, the simplest form of learning is habituation. Simply keep applying stimuli and there's
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.940]   less response. Like, this is what organisms do. This is what we have to do. And it's like,
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.820]   there's this dis habituation component that like-
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.780]   - Dis habituation.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.380]   - Yes. Like we wouldn't be able to get through life if we wouldn't be able to cross that street,
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.580]   if we were like, hold, like this is a miracle.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:34.260]   - It sounds like on psychedelics, the, one of the primary goals therapeutically is to really drill into one of
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:41.300]   these perceptual bubbles and expand that bubble and the safety it seems is the safety. It's sort of like
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.420]   a permission to, to do that without worrying that something's going to happen.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.540]   - Right. Because, you know, I've had people there on the couch.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.180]   Yeah. I remember one lady said, this is probably, uh, 13, 14 years ago said,
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.620]   "Matt, tell me again. I can't die. Like, I feel like my heart is going to rip through my chest."
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.300]   I mean, she was feeling her, and I should say, typically cardiovascular response is, is modest.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.420]   The, the pulse and blood pressure go up. And if it goes over a certain level, we have a protocol and
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.580]   we've had to do this only a few times, but the physician comes in, gives them a little nitroglycerin
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.860]   under the tongue, uh, and, uh, you know, knocks the blood pressure down a little bit,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.700]   doesn't affect the experience. So we have it all in place, even though they'd probably be fine out of
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:31.300]   an abundance of caution. Um, but, but yeah, but someone can feel that, my God, I'm going to die.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.260]   Like I, I have never felt my heart beat like this before.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:42.340]   So there's a, an expansion of a particular, fairly narrow percept. It could be sound,
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.380]   could be an emotion, could be sadness, could be a historical event or a fear of the future.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:53.620]   And you've mentioned before that there's something to be learned in that experience.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:01.940]   There's something about going into that experience in a, in an, um, in an, in an undeterred way
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:08.180]   that allows somebody to bring something back into more standard reality.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.940]   Given the huge variety of experiences that people have on psychedelics, given the huge variety of
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.900]   humans that are out there, but what are now very clear therapeutic effects in the realm of depression,
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   what do you think is the value of going into this fairly restricted perceptual bubble? What we are
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:36.420]   calling letting go or giving up control, because if the experiences are many, but the value of what
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.340]   one exports from that experience is kind of similar across individuals, that raises all sorts of
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.740]   interesting questions. And this is not a philosophy discussion. We're talking about biology and
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.620]   psychology here.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.460]   So what are your thoughts on that?
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:55.140]   This is in the terrain we're figuring out, you know, so there's no, the educated speculations,
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:04.100]   the best I can provide, but I, I think the best, the, the, the, the most, I think the common denominator
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.900]   are persisting changes in self-representation.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.140]   Okay. Tell me more about self-representation.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:17.780]   That's, uh, the way one holds the sense of self, the relate, the fundamental relationship
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.820]   of a person in the world. I mentioned earlier that these experiences seem to alter the models we hold
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.860]   of reality. And I think that the self is the biggest model that I am a thing that's separate from other
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:37.460]   things. And that's, I am defined by certain, I have a certain personality and I, I'm a smoker that's
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:43.220]   having a hard time quitting, or I'm a depressed person that, you know, views myself as a failure and all of
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.820]   these things. Those are models too. So this is this expansion of the perceptual bubble, a narrow,
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.740]   a narrow, uh, percept that then grows within the confines of that narrow percept.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:54.980]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:00.180]   The, so sense of self is a very interesting, uh, phenomenon. And if we could dissect it a little
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.260]   bit, um, there's the somatic sense of self. So the ability to literally feel the self, uh,
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.140]   into this process we call interoception. And then there's the, the, the title of the self,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.340]   the I am blank. Yeah. And I noticed you said that several times and it's intriguing to me how one
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:25.700]   defines themselves internally, not just to other people, but how one psychologically and by default
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:32.020]   in, uh, defines themselves, I think is very powerful. Like, um, and depressed people as well as happy
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.980]   people seem to define themselves in terms of these categories of emotional states. So I think it's,
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:44.500]   it's so interesting that letting go and going into this perceptual bubble, which is facilitated by
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:51.460]   obviously a really wonderful team of, of therapists, but also the serotonergic agent allows us to, um,
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.780]   potentially reshape the perception of self. That's, that's a tremendous feat of neuroplasticity.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.660]   Right. I think there's something about this change in, in sense of self. There is, it seems to be
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.060]   something on the identity level, both with, I think of the, the work we did with cancer patients who had
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.940]   substantial depression and anxiety because of their cancer, and also our work with people trying to quit
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:19.700]   cigarette smoking. I mean, there's this real, there seems to be when it really works, this change in how
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:29.140]   people view themselves like smoking, like really stepping out of this model. Like I'm a smoker.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.980]   It's tough to quit smoking cigarettes. I can't do it. I failed a bunch of times. I remember one
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.980]   participant during the session, but he held onto this afterwards said, my God, it's like, I can really
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:47.380]   just decide like flicking off a bike. I can decide not to smoke. And it's, I call these duh experiences
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:53.060]   with psychedelics because people often like in the cancer studies say, I'm causing most of my own
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.860]   suffering. Like I can, I can follow my appointments. I can do everything, but I can still plan for the,
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:03.540]   I'm not getting outside in the sunshine. I'm not playing with my grandkids. I'm choosing to do that.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.020]   And it's like, they told themselves that before. And the smoker has told themselves a million times
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.460]   I can, so it sounds when it comes out of their mouths and folks will say, this is part of the
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.180]   ineffability of a psychedelic experience. Folks say, I know this sounds like bullshit. And this sounds like,
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:26.980]   but my God, I could just decide. Like they're feeling this gravity of agency that seems to be at times
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:32.980]   fundamentally like supercharged from a psychedelic experience. This idea, like I'm just going to make
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.140]   make a decision. Like normally, like you tell a depressed person, like, don't,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.180]   don't think of yourself that way. You're not a failure. You're looking at all that. It's just,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.820]   yeah. It's like, and you can actually, in one of these states have an experience where you realize
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.020]   like, my God, just like using MDMA to treat PTSD. And we're going to be starting work with psilocybin
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:57.700]   to treat PTSD. Someone could really reprocess their trauma in a way that like has lasting effects.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.620]   And clearly there's probably something, you know, reconsolidation of those memories. They are,
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.460]   they are, they are altered, you know, very consistent with what the, our understanding of the
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:13.860]   way memory works. So the whole idea of people can actually, in a few hours, have a, such a profound
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:19.780]   experience that they, they decide to make these changes in who they are and it sticks.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:27.220]   I'm fascinated by this idea that a, a somatic and a perceptual experience, but a real experience of
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.100]   the sort that you're describing is what allows us to reshape our neural circuitry and to feel
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:40.180]   differently about ourselves. And I know there's been really tremendous success in many individuals of
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:46.020]   alleviating depression, of treating trauma with these different compounds. If we could,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.060]   I'd like to just ask about some of the more dopaminergic compounds, in particular MDMA.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:59.700]   Yeah. And my understanding is that MDMA leads to very robust increases in both dopamine and serotonin
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:08.020]   simultaneously. So why would it be that having this increased dopamine and increased serotonin would
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:15.060]   provide an experience that is beneficial? And how do you, to the extent that you can describe it,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:19.620]   how do you think that experience differs from the sorts of experiences that people have on psilocybin
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:27.940]   or more serotonergic agents? Speculating, but it may be that MDMA for a broader number of people
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:35.780]   is better for, for trauma because the chances of having an extremely challenging experience, what I call
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:43.380]   the bad trip, like really freaking out is much lower with MDMA. People can have bad trips, but they're of a
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:49.540]   different nature. It's not, it's not sort of like freaking out because all of reality is sort of
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:56.180]   shattering and it's less of this. It can take so many forms with the classic psychedelics, but like
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:02.500]   typically you'll, you'll hear something like, I didn't know it was going to be like this, no matter how
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:09.220]   hard you tried to prepare them that like, this is like, get me off this. You're talking about LSD or
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:18.260]   psilocybin. Yeah. Yeah. And just the sense of like, I'm going insane. This is so far beyond anything I've
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:26.580]   ever experienced. And it's scaring the out of me. I don't have a toehold on anything, even that I exist
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.420]   as, as, as, as an entity. And that can be really, I think, frankly, experientially, that's kind of the
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:39.540]   gateway to both the transcendental mystical experiences, the, the, the sense, uh, of unity
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:46.260]   with all things, which we know our data suggests is related, um, to long-term positive outcomes.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.780]   Wait, I want to make sure I understand. So you're saying the bad trip can be related to the
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.300]   transcendental experience. Right. I think those are both speculating, but you, you have to pass through
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:02.660]   this sort of like, you know, reality shattering, including your sense of self. And one can handle
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:09.380]   that in one of two ways. You can either completely surrender to it, or you can try to hang on. And if
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.780]   you try to hang on, it's going to be more like a bad trip. So again, I wish there was more, and hopefully
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.220]   there will be more experimentation. There's a lot going on here in the black box in terms of the operant
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:26.420]   behavior of how you are, you know, within yourself choosing to handle like letting go, you know,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.540]   and eventually we'll be able to see this in real time with brain imaging. Ah, there they are surrendering
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.460]   to the psychedelic experience here. They are trying to hold on, but we we're not there yet. But I think
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.580]   it's a good through clinical observation seems pretty clear that something like that is going on.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:50.020]   There has been an attempt at creating this movement toward openness about psychedelics and their positive
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:55.380]   effects. This has happened before. The difference is that now there are people like you inside the walls
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.660]   of the university or publishing peer reviewed studies and things of that sort. The question is to me,
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:06.580]   you know, what are the, what are the valuable exports, right? And where does the extreme lie? I mean,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:14.980]   clearly there's a, there's a problem with tinkering with reality through pharmacology and there's a
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:22.900]   benefit. It sounds like to tinkering with reality through pharmacology and for the average person,
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.940]   right? Or for kids that are hearing this kids that are in their teens, right? Yeah. What are the,
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.100]   I want to talk about what are the dangers of psychedelics? This is something you don't hear a lot
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.660]   about these days and it's not because I'm anti-psychotic at all, but what are the dangers?
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:45.860]   Yeah. So these can be profoundly destabilizing experiences and ones that, you know, ideally
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:54.660]   are had in a safe container, you know, sort of where, where someone, you know,
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:00.660]   what are the relevant dangers and what can we do to mitigate those? So there's two biggies.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:09.860]   One, and I've already mentioned, it's people with very severe psychiatric illness, not, not depression,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:18.260]   not anxiety. I'm talking about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia or mania as part of bipolar disorder.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.660]   The far more likely danger is the bad trip.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.540]   Anyone can have this, the most psychologically healthy person in the world, probably.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   You jack the dose high enough and especially in, in, in a less than an ideal environment,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.020]   you can have a bad trip. You can, you even get it in an ideal environment like ours at,
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:42.340]   at a high dose of around 30 milligrams of psilocybin. After, you know, the best preparation we can provide,
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:47.460]   about a third of people will say, essentially at some point they have a bad trip, you know, and we.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.260]   At some point within the entire journey. Right. Now they could have one of the most beautiful
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.220]   experiences of their life, sometimes like a couple minutes later. Right. But at some point they had a
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:03.780]   sense of strong anxiety, fear, losing their mind, feeling trapped, something like that.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:10.500]   I definitely want to ask you about micro dose versus standard or macro dosing psilocybin.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:17.140]   I'm micro cynical, if you will, about this term micro dose. Is there any clinical evidence or peer
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.340]   reviewed published evidence that it works, quote unquote, to make people feel better about anything?
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:29.460]   So yeah, the claims are in their number of them. There's two general ones. One is, is sort of acting
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:36.740]   in place of the ADHD treating drugs. So the psychomotor stimulants, so like a better version of Adderall.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.820]   The other claims are essentially a better version of, of the traditional antidepressants,
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:48.900]   a better version of Prozac. None of the peer reviewed studies that are, have much credibility.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:56.340]   Um, none of them have shown a benefit. The handful of studies that have done that have shown
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:02.420]   they've ranged from finding no effect whatsoever to just a little bit of impairment, like impairing
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:08.420]   someone's ability to do, um, time estimation and production tasks. So you want an accurate sense of
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.820]   time, at least if you're navigating in the real world, it's different if you're on the couch on
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.460]   a heroic dose for therapeutic reasons where you're safe. But if you're crossing the street,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.660]   if you're getting, you know, in your work life, which is what the way people are claiming to, you know,
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.860]   use that it helps them be a better CEO. Like you want an accurate sense of time. So if anything,
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.460]   the data suggests that it makes it a little bit less accurate. And, and there's evidence that someone
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:40.580]   feels, uh, a little bit impaired, um, and they feel a little bit high. So in terms of, you know,
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:46.980]   you call that abuse liability and research so far, no studies have, have shown, you know,
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:55.940]   any increase in creativity, enhancement of any form of cognition or, or, or a sustained improvement in mood.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:03.380]   Now, no studies have actually looked at the, the, the, the system of microdosing that the
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:09.220]   aficionados are claiming folks like, um, Paul Stamets and others, they'll have particular formulas.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.100]   They're like, you need to take it one day and then take so many days off and take it every four days.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.340]   And they really say, you need to be on it for a while. Like a few weeks in, you may start to notice
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.900]   through this pattern of, of, of using it. And you, you're, you're feeling the benefits
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:30.100]   on those off days, like the three or two days in between your active doses. So those are the claims.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.500]   Again, we don't know that there's any truth to that working, but studies have not been done
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:42.580]   to model that. So that's a big caveat. My bet is, and this is totally based on anecdotes that I think
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:48.180]   there is probably a reality to the antidepressant effects. I find that more intriguing because of
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:53.140]   the suffering with depression, right? Even if it's an, it, it wouldn't be as interesting as I think
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:58.580]   what we're doing with high dose psilocybin or psychedelics to treat, um, depression. It would
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.780]   be, if this is developed and there's a reality, it would be more like a better, you know, perhaps a
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:11.220]   better SSRI, a better Prozac, which are similar, more tools than fewer tools in the toolbox. And it
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.140]   shouldn't be that surprised. Like even before the, as going back to the tricyclics and the MAO
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:23.140]   inhibitors going back to the fifties, like augmenting extracellular serotonin in one way or another
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:29.460]   for many people leads to a, to reduction in depressive symptoms. It wouldn't be that crazy
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.380]   for chronically stimulating a subtype of serotonin receptor that you have an antidepressant effect.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:40.980]   So I think if I had put my bets on it, that there's, if there's anything real, it is in that category.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.940]   Although I'm very open to like, maybe there is something to the creativity,
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:52.820]   to the, you know, improved cognition, which covers many domains in and of itself. But, um, my, my
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:59.700]   greatest hopes are on the, uh, on the antidepressant effects that said in the big picture, I think all of
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.020]   the most interesting thing about psychedelics are the heroic doses. I mean, the idea that you can give
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.700]   something one, two, three times and you see improvements in depression months later and in
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.540]   addiction, you know, over a year later and with these, you know, people dealing with potentially
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.860]   terminal illness. I mean, it's, I mean, I'm interested in big effects.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.340]   Right. I want to make sure that I ask you about the other really important mission that you're
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.700]   involved in with respect to psychedelics, which is not about depression per se, but is about
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.820]   neurological, a neurologic injury or head injury. You know, we always think sports, but there are many
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:42.420]   people who make a living in a way that is, um, over time is detrimental to their brain. What do you
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.820]   think is the potential for these compounds, particular psilocybin, but other compounds as well for the, um,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:56.580]   treatment and possible even reversal of neurological injuries? There are anecdotes of, of people saying,
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:03.860]   uh, that, that psychedelics have helped heal their brain. You know, they've been in one of these
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:10.180]   situations like in sports, uh, a sport where there's repetitive head impact and they're claiming that,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.860]   you know, using psychedelics has actually improved their cognitive function. For example, improved their
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:22.980]   memory. If you take these anecdotes and you combine it way across orders of analysis to the rodent research
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:29.780]   from, um, several labs like David Olson, Brian, uh, Roth, these folks that have shown different forms of
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:38.500]   neuroplasticity unfolding. Those effects may be at play and they improve in the psychiatric treatments
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.980]   that we're dealing with that hat. We don't know that it seems like a decent guess. And we're going
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.260]   to be figuring out whether that's the case, but another potential that that sets up is that maybe
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.020]   that's what's going on with, um, with, um, with, with, with, with these claims of improvements from
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:06.420]   neurological issues that there's actually, you know, uh, a repair of the brain, uh, uh, from injuries,
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.140]   underlying, you know, things that, you know, situations where there's repetitive head impact,
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:17.620]   perhaps there's a potential for, for helping folks recover from stroke, um, and disorders like that.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:24.260]   Um, it is more exploratory, but what I'm hoping to do is some work with retired athletes who have been
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.940]   exposed, but by the nature of their sport, for example, in an a athletes in the UFC who have been
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:36.580]   exposed to, um, repetitive head impacts, like a lot of sports, um, a lot of, uh, you know, sports expose
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:42.100]   people to, and, and, and who are retired from the sport and are suffering from say depression,
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:49.540]   which can, uh, in part result from those types of, of, of that history of head impact.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:57.380]   Um, see if we can fix the depression, but then also as a cherry on top in a more exploratory aim,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:04.500]   see if we can have evidence of, of improvement in cognitive function and associate like using MRI,
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.980]   see if it affects gray matter over time, these types of things to see if there are actually some
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:16.740]   evidence of this improved, um, like this more direct repair of the brain. But again, it is very
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:23.780]   sort of like, we've got some rodent data, we've got some human anecdotes. We, we, we will acknowledge
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.020]   it's early days and we look forward to seeing the data. Um, I, I appreciate how cautious you are
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.260]   and tentative you are. You're not drawing any conclusions. Thank you so much for your time.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.580]   Thank you for your time, for your knowledge. And I think you put it best earlier for, uh, holding
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:47.700]   the candle in a very dark time. And then now there's light.
