[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   Jenny started her career on the trading floor in Chicago. She co-founded Peak Six
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.400]   in 1997 with one and a half million dollars in seed capital as a proprietary
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.800]   options trading firm. Now it's a multi-billion dollar financial services
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640]   trading and technology firm. Really excited to hear from Jenny today. Please
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.560]   join me in welcoming Jenny to the stage.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   [Music]
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.560]   Stupid women drivers!
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.560]   [Helicopter]
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   Stupid women helicopter pilots!
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560]   It's not prejudice, it's just that men are naturally superior drivers.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   You're goddamn women drivers!
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560]   Women drivers.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   Maybe women are competent drivers.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560]   Women drivers, that's the problem.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.560]   When a woman's at the wheel, polyglass means more than mileage.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   [Laughter]
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.060]   Welcome everybody and thank you for having me here today. As they said, I'm
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.560]   Jenny and I started Peak Six in 1997 as a proprietary equity options trading firm.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.060]   We've evolved over time into a technology firm, including in the
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.560]   insure tech space. And the one thing I know about these videos, men are bad at math.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560]   [Laughter]
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.060]   As you can see, there's clearly no difference between driving abilities and
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.560]   insurance rates. Now, 100 years ago, women were less than 10% of the drivers.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.060]   It was deemed risky and a man's job. But 50 years later, we see that it's
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.060]   changed. We see these kind of trends again and again, where participation rate
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.060]   eventually equals skill or ability. We know that women are half of the voters.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.060]   They're more than half of the college graduates. A really, really important
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.060]   place it has not changed is in the financial world. So Peak Six also owns, as
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.060]   they were saying, the Apex FinTech Solutions. It's a SaaS-based clearing and
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   custody firm. We have 220 B2B clients, 120 billion in assets. We have tens of
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.060]   millions of end customers. The truth is, more than half of you are likely on our
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.060]   technology today and you didn't know it. We are the back end for more than 60% of
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.060]   the FinTechs out there. So think Webull, SoFi, Ally, Stash, eToro, Public. You're
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.060]   probably on our technology. And what we know about that data is it's like
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.060]   driving and voting and education. There's no difference between investing, doing
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:14.060]   it between men and women. However, there is one big difference, and that is
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   participation rate. I wonder why.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.060]   I've offered our lovely sales assistant, Danielle Harrison, here $10,000 to shave
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.060]   a fucking head!
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.060]   [Cheering]
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.060]   Yeah, you want this?
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.060]   Let's give a fuck!
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.060]   [Laughter]
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   So while we have many different businesses at Peak Six, the heart and soul
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.060]   remains our trading firm. Now, when I started Peak Six in 1997, the world was
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.060]   very different. All the trading happened on the exchange floors. I was in those
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   trading pits.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:07.060]   [Cheering]
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.060]   So it's clear to me that things could probably be done a little bit better. And
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.060]   in 1998, we actually started using technology and we became one of the first
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.060]   off-floor equity options trading firms in the world. And despite all the booms and
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.060]   bust cycles, the dot-com, the financial crisis, COVID, Peak Six has never had a
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060]   losing year.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.060]   [Applause]
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.060]   Now, we're not a fund. We don't have outside money. We had a little bit, you
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.060]   heard in the beginning. Those investors were paid back many times over very early
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   on. You know, I could have invested in bonds or stocks or Berkshire Hathaway or
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.060]   Steve Jobs and Apple, but I invested in the best idea I could see. I invested in
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.060]   the proposition that a female trader could hang with the guys.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.060]   [Applause]
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.060]   So how did that turn out for me? Bonds, $100 invested in 1997, now worth about
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:31.060]   $300. The market, about $700. Mr. Buffett, $1,200. Apple, $180,000.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.060]   Peak Six?
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.060]   [Cheering]
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.060]   Well, a hell of a lot more. So how? Well, it starts with understanding options.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.060]   In the options world, there are almost 6,000 stocks that have listed options,
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.060]   and that's all the different times and expirations, so-called a million and a
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.060]   half-ish securities. At any given point in time, Peak Six will have positions in
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.060]   3,000 to 4,000 of those stock names with their associated positions. So while it
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.060]   requires a lot of technology, obviously, to manage this, we're not a high
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.060]   frequency firm. We actually carry the inventory. We have it on our books as we
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.060]   speak. So I think high frequency, it's more like a delivery service. They don't
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.060]   really take risk, and it's just about speed and efficiency. A really good way to
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.060]   think about Peak Six is like a grocery store. So we're servicing our customers,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:41.060]   and we need to manage the inventory well. We're much closer to like a Walmart or
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.060]   a Safeway. And like them, if we don't manage the inventory well, it goes bad.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060]   We lose. So in the same way that prices at the store are going to move around
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.060]   based on consumer demand or on outside forces on supply like logistics or
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.060]   weather, option prices are moving around as well. Remember, we're trading in
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.060]   these 6,000 different names with different time frames, all unique
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.060]   characteristics, different earnings, different dividends. We're trading
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.060]   hundreds of thousands of options every single day. So our biggest expense, as you
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:23.060]   might imagine, is technology. We're receiving billions of messages per second.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.060]   So we get the entire marketplace. What do we see? What's moving into extremes?
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.060]   We might be looking at individual names that are doing that, industries, or the
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:41.060]   marketplace as a whole. So what am I seeing today? Well, most people know that
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:48.060]   over time, stocks outperform bonds. You take risk. You should be rewarded. Now,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.060]   if we look at how much better off you'd be by buying stocks, you can see it moves
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.060]   in a relatively stable line upward sloping with some periods where stocks are
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.060]   more or less expensive or cheap. Some of you remember the dot-com bubble. Some of
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.060]   you are pretty young out there. Most of us will remember the financial crisis.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.060]   You can see that second star. Obviously COVID. And clearly no surprise to see
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:20.060]   these kind of disruptions show up. Then you can see today. Then you can see
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.060]   today. Now, there are a lot of people who are talking about this. And for me, I've
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.060]   seen a lot. And it's really hard to call it top or bottom. And we don't pretend to
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:37.060]   call it tops or bottoms, frankly. But what's unusual this time is that when
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:49.060]   things get stretched, risk or the cost of options tends to be expensive. Today, you
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:55.060]   can see the previous three from the last slide. And look at today. How low
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:03.060]   volatility is. This is why at this point, and in the month of August, we've owned
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:11.060]   more options in our portfolio than -- it's probably top five in our history. So,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.060]   our key to success is to manage the inventory top down and bottoms up all day
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   every day. And when the great ideas, we've got to push all in. When they come, we
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:27.060]   push all in. And as good as this opportunity might seem, I'm going to tell you
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   about an opportunity that makes that small in comparison. There is going to be
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:46.060]   a market correction. The correction is that half of the participants are going to
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:10:01.060]   identify as female. How? I'll take it. [Applause]
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.060]   Hopefully it's not a surprise to this room, but it's been right underneath our
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:15.060]   nose for a really long time. We are going to teach them poker. Now, most of you
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:21.060]   know that poker teaches indispensable life skills. Certainly our lovely host
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:28.060]   espoused this all the time. It teaches strategy. It teaches taking risk. It
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:36.060]   teaches capital allocation. I could go on and on. But guess what? Men are getting
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:45.060]   those lessons, and women are not. Of the more than 110 million plus -- nobody
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   really knows the number -- poker players in the world, less than 10% are women.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:59.060]   Just like driving 100 years ago. So we started a company. It's called Poker
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   Power, even though they said Power Poker. I'll take either, as long as you're
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.060]   saying it. It's called Poker Power. We're on a mission to teach a million women
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:29.060]   this game. [Applause]
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.060]   We have a team of companies who recognize how important this skill can be to
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:39.060]   their employees, and they are teaching this game alongside of us. Some of the
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.060]   biggest tech companies in the world, the biggest banks, investment banks, law
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:53.060]   firms, you name it. So, when I look out at this crowd, frankly, it looks fairly
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:01.060]   similar-ish to the trading floor many years ago. And in five years, it's going
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:09.060]   to look very different. That is my prediction. Hopefully sooner. How? Well,
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:20.060]   it starts by going -- actually going -- actually going all in. We're not all in
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:29.060]   if 50% of the population trades, invests, or plays poker. This podcast is not
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:46.060]   called "Men In." It actually has the word "all" in its name. So, we are going to
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:55.060]   challenge you guys. Challenge the hosts. Challenge the future listeners of this
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   podcast. To see how many girls -- and I say girls -- we can teach this game as
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:07.060]   early as seven or eight. How many girls and women can you bring to the poker
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:16.060]   table? We're going to kick off a competition today. Over the next month, we
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:23.060]   want to see who can refer the most women to the Poker Power Play app. In my
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:30.060]   opinion, it's brand-new. First, gender-neutral, truly gender-neutral poker
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.060]   app on the market. Super easy. Love all the cameras I'm seeing. To get the QR
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:46.060]   code and to refer the girls and women in your life. What's in it for you? Well, I
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   was thinking the hosts could decide. Knowing them, maybe it's like a Laurel
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:14:00.060]   Piano something or Montclair. Maybe it's a buy-in to the WSOP. But whatever it
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:09.060]   is, it's my gift to you. So, let's not just trade or invest in the market. Let's
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:15.060]   make the market. Let's go all in. Thank you.
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:21.060]   [Applause]
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   Thank you.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.060]   [Applause]
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:35.060]   Amazing. As a father of three daughters, I very much appreciate you making this
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:41.060]   your passion. It's absolutely fantastic. We've averaged about 32, 33, over the
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:47.060]   first two conferences, about 33% female. But we had to take a lot of steps to
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.060]   make that happen. Scholarships and just, you know, finding women's organizations
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:56.060]   encourage more people to come. I'm curious, just looking at the world largely,
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.060]   we've seen a massive change. There are more women getting graduate degrees than
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:08.060]   men today. Earnings, positions of power. It's really changed a lot. Why do you
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.060]   think it's a little sticky in finance specifically? And is there something in,
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:19.060]   we see it in venture capital as well. We've seen many more check writing females,
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.060]   not just window dressing, like here's the PR person, we're calling them a
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.060]   partner in the venture firm, and that kind of nonsense. But I'm curious why it
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:32.060]   hasn't happened in finance as quickly as maybe some other pursuits. And then
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:39.060]   second question, when you do get women at the poker table, and it does click, what
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:44.060]   do you see change in them in terms of, you know, how they look at the world?
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   You can take that in either order.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:53.060]   >> Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating, I have to say. So why hasn't it happened
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.060]   sooner? I'll do that one. So what I've learned, of course, being a female in a
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.060]   male dominated world for my whole career, I also grew up with four brothers. So
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.060]   it's no surprise maybe that I'm there. But also, like, begging to figure out how
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.060]   to solve the problem, I will tell you it squarely comes down to risk taking. So
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   it's -- and what we don't realize, so in our natural play and hobbies, typical,
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:27.060]   you know, the stereotype, how a young girl plays, I'm not taking risk. And one
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:32.060]   of the things that we have found, and what I see actually helps women at the
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:40.060]   poker table, it's -- because every hand is a risk of some sort. They don't get
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.060]   enough repetition of risk. So we don't talk about taking larger risks. We
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.060]   actually talk about taking -- not taking more risk, sorry, let me step back, more
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:17:01.060]   risk. We talk about taking more risks with an S. So we need to get reps in. And
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:09.060]   those reps aren't part of our upbringing. So for someone coming into trading, you
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.060]   get a lot of fucking reps, right? At the poker table. That's why if we can get
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   these girls playing, I'm telling you, right, the guys are ahead. We know this.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   The study's been done. First rung on the ladder is where the woman falls behind.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   The guy will take the job with 60% confidence, and the next managerial job
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   become equal out of school, and she needs 90% confidence. Of course she does.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.060]   She hasn't taken risks. So we have to get those under their belt. Whatever they
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   look like. And by the way, they look different for everybody. And watching
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:51.060]   what is a risk for your daughter, in fact, if you guys are up for it, I think
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   there's nine daughters here. >> Two, two, three. >> Three. >> Three. Three, six,
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:06.060]   four. Yeah. >> It's like seven and a half. Seven and a half, I think. Just back
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:14.060]   of the envelope math. >> Yes. But -- >> You see how fast I did that? >> You can't
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.060]   count in simple numbers, bro. >> But here's the thing. We're having this
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   discussion, I think, in 2023 here, just even saying there are gender differences
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   in this, and there are different ways in which girls are raised versus boys. It's
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   kind of the third rail, but listen, it is what it is. And maybe you can talk --
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.060]   when you give them that push and they get 10 sessions in, 50 sessions in, now
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   they play 1,000 hands of cards, 2,000 hands of cards, what do you see happen to
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.060]   them when they go out into the world? What changes in them when they learn to
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.060]   take risks, when they learn to bluff, when they learn to re-raise, and when they
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.060]   learn to fold when they thought they had a really strong hand, but hey, that
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.060]   board's textured. >> Yeah. So we have -- we literally get testimonials, and
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   there are many senior women who are part in this corporate work we do. The
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   senior women are sort of floored and flabbergasted, I can't believe, right? So
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.060]   I didn't realize I wasn't playing to win would be a very common thing. I didn't
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.060]   realize somebody would actually do that. >> Yeah. >> Right? Like, I didn't
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   actually know everything when I went into that meeting. I assumed I did,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   because I'm giving everything that I know. I'm not holding back at all. The
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   thought of holding back is not part of the repertoire either. It's the giving
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:46.060]   and giving totally of self. So strategy is -- unless it's actively discussed,
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:52.060]   right, isn't seemingly as natural. Obviously when we have athletes or, you
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   know, other types of experiences coming in, that tends to change it. I think --
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:03.060]   you know, I'll give you a basic question for a young woman who comes in, and she
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:10.060]   goes into a meeting, and she doesn't say anything. It's kind of like you folded
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.060]   a hand. Maybe you folded a few hands. We all know we need to fold a lot of
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:21.060]   hands to win. But she keeps folding, she keeps folding. What is she waiting
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.060]   for? Because if she keeps folding, we know she's ultimately going to lose. If
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   she never speaks up in a meeting based on Toby, we should never have been in the
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.060]   goddamn meeting. >> She's going to get blinded out. >> Exactly. She'll be gone.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.060]   So at some point she has to take a risk, even if her cards aren't great in that
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.060]   meeting, if she wants to participate. >> How do you define risk? Because for a
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.060]   lot of people in a naive context that haven't looked at probability and
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:51.060]   statistics and understood that something is unlikely to happen, but the payoff
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:56.060]   you're getting is worth it to take that. It's a 30% chance of happening. But if
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.060]   it happens, you get paid 5 to 1. So that's a good bet to make. And is that the
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   sort of kind of rubric that, you know, folks start to kind of go through to
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.060]   understand what it means to take risk, that it's not just about doing something
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   scary or something unlikely, jump into anything scary or anything unlikely,
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.060]   because sometimes that risk isn't worth the payoff and sometimes it is. >> It is.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.060]   It is both of those things, actually. So when I talk about teaching poker and the
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   first thing a man will do is say, well, if you're not playing for real money,
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.060]   you're not really playing, which is not a true statement. Play with your kids for,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   you know, pretzels and M&Ms or marshmallows and see what happens. You're
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.060]   playing a real game and you're causing the brain to think differently. But we,
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.060]   so we start way down on the curve for our women, because the whole goal is to
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.060]   create safety and security and learning this game that is male dominated, where
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   they feel like they're going to be judged. And so probably it's around lesson
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.060]   four, so we have a curriculum that they're starting to learn the numbers as
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.060]   well. And how do I do it in, you know, a basic way, a quick, easy way, and then
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   how do I get better and better as I go up the curve? >> There's a great book
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   written by Annie Duke called Thinking in Bets. >> Yeah, great book. >> And I
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   would encourage all of you to read it, because I think, Friedberg, what you're
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.060]   stating is actually something that a lot of people have, which is a little bit of
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:27.060]   mathematical illiteracy around probability and probabilistic thinking. And it is a
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   very different mindset to think about expected value. Why do you make a certain
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   bet some number of times? Why losing 15 times in a row literally can be okay,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:43.060]   because over a distribution of 100 times, you may actually come out ahead. It's a
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   very difficult way to train your mind. >> By the way, I think it's really
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:54.060]   important in a broader social context, so that not everything is right or wrong.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:23:00.060]   Not everything is I will win this bet or I will lose this bet. It requires a
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.060]   second dimension attached to every decision, which is the probability, which
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.060]   most people don't do, and it's what also makes conversations around things like
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.060]   social policy and politics difficult, because people say this is one way or the
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.060]   other, but it's like, hey, if we do this this way, there's a 30% chance it might
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.060]   work. There's a 70% chance it might not. But if it does work, it's ten times the
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   return. That's worth us doing. So we should expect failure. But if we succeed,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.060]   it's going to be in an outsized way. If we get to make enough of those sorts of
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.060]   decisions, things can move. We get caught up in a lot of our decision making, you
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:40.060]   know, and social policy as well. >> David's a huge feminist thinker, and I'm
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   curious, David, you're taking all this in right now, and I can see the wheels
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:54.060]   turning. Your thoughts on, you know, in the postmodern feminist world, how do you
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   think poker plays into -- >> The lunch break is not going to be fun.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:04.060]   >> I recognize that face. I see that. >> You see the compassion and the EQ.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:09.060]   >> I haven't learned how to virtue signal quite as well as you do, Jack Alpert.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.060]   >> Just try genuflecting one time. Give us one genuflect.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:20.060]   >> I do have an observation, actually, on this, which is I think the point you
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:25.060]   made, actually, that safety is the opposite of risk is a really interesting
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.060]   point, because the thing that you hear over and over again, for example, in
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.060]   these debates we have over free speech, is safetyism. We have to make the
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   environment safe for people. We don't want them to hear arguments they don't
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.060]   like. They need the safe space. I've never bought that as an argument for
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   censorship, for example, but you're making, I think, a different argument,
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   which I hadn't really appreciated before, which is if we don't make people
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.060]   comfortable with risk, then they're not going to be successful in these areas.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.060]   That's another downside of this aggrandizement of safety.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   >> Psychological safety when you come to work is a fallacy. Right? I mean,
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.060]   this is the worst thing you could do to somebody is to make them
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   psychologically safe. The world is not safe. >> Right.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   >> I have a market question. I apologize for my jumping.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   >> Can I just say one thing on that? So I literally was at a dinner last
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:26.060]   week, and there was a man from a very old, successful firm, and he said,
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.060]   after too many drinks, all the women who come and ask to be partners at our
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   firm, they always come with a perfect track record. They never have lost
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   money. And I was like, and you're surprised? >> Right.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   >> Right? I mean, it's so backwards that these extraordinarily successful
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.060]   women feel like that is the journey that has to be had. In fact, it's the
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.060]   opposite of the journey. What we all want them to see is how they have
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:01.060]   failed, how often they failed, how they kept the failure to a minimum.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   >> So in some ways, these are like the highest performers. >> Exactly.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   >> Perhaps if they were men in this country. >> No, it's not even just men.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.060]   >> They would take more risk. >> As an immigrant, my first job was on a
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   trading floor, and I had an incredible boss who took me aside and taught me
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   the difference between batting average and slugging percentage. And that's
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   another concept that's poorly understood, because when you're at the bottom
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.060]   looking up, you think you have to be perfect. That's batting average. But
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.060]   when you realize that in baseball, the best batter in the history of
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   baseball, you know, is basically a 400-hitter, but that was like once, and
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   that's an aberration in the '50s or '60s, that'll never happen again. You
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.060]   realize, okay, we're hitting for slugging percentage. And that means
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.060]   implicitly huge error rates. >> Yes. >> Tons of losses. And unless you
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.060]   internalize it and figure out how to manage it, you can't make a ton of
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.060]   money. I just want to shift the conversation. >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.060]   >> You're an incredible business person. You have a vantage point that I
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.060]   find really fascinating, and you put on a chart up there where -- about
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.060]   inventory of options now, you're sort of at this really interesting moment.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   Financial vol is kind of like been decimated. What does that mean as you
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:11.060]   look forward based on your pattern recognition of the past? Where are we
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.060]   headed into? And knowing where your firm is positioned in all of that.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   >> Yeah. So we're in an odd place right now, I think, right? It has a
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:27.060]   .com-esque because of AI feel to it, but we have the Fed maybe is going to
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:33.060]   raise a little bit more, but not. Inflation may be slowing, but it may not.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.060]   We have sector rotation. We have a lot of push and pull. You're right in the
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:46.060]   middle. And so what is going to snap that one way or another? Definitely
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:52.060]   not something our firm tries to make the call on, but we're saying it's
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   ready. It's ready and it can if a handful of things happen, whatever
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.060]   they may be, exogenous events, whatever it might be. And we want to be
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.060]   ready. And by the way, we might be wrong. We'll just waste a bunch of
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060]   money holding the inventory that's going to rot. But --
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   >> But basically you're long vol, is what you're saying. Massively long
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.060]   vol and you're waiting for something in one direction or the other to
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   break the market.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.060]   >> It's a good time of the year, right? We're going to go into next
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.060]   earnings cycle.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   >> We have to wrap. I really appreciate you coming out, sharing your
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   story. I encourage everyone, the QR code, we'll share that and everyone
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.060]   can hopefully download the app and promote.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.060]   >> And just as girl dads, thank you.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   >> Yeah. And thank you so much.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.060]   >> Thank you for doing this. I appreciate that.
