[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks",
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.200]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and last week,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.480]   I had an amazing conversation with Brandon Presser
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.920]   about everything Japan, where to go, what to see,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.000]   planning your trip, the culture, and so much more.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.320]   But I didn't have the time to cover one more thing
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.940]   I really wanted to get to,
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.280]   how to use your points and miles to fly there,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.920]   and for hotels when you get there,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.120]   and also some ways to increase those points balances,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   and a few other ways to save on a trip
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740]   even if you're not using points.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.780]   So I wanted to do an entire follow-up episode on that.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200]   But even if you're not planning a trip to Japan,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.880]   a lot of what I'm gonna talk about today
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.700]   will hopefully help you think about any trip you're taking
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.160]   or boosting miles and points
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.680]   that you might not know what you wanna do with yet.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.480]   But if you haven't heard that episode yet,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.720]   go back and have a listen,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.960]   because you might actually end up wanting to plan a trip
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.800]   to Japan sooner than you thought.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   In fact, I know a lot of you
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000]   have already started planning your trip
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   because I got so many amazing emails and DMs from you
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   about the Japan episode.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.840]   Haven't gotten to respond to everyone yet,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.140]   but I'm so happy you all enjoyed the episode.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.160]   I'm excited for your trips to Japan,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.840]   and I think I'll keep experimenting
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.200]   with having these country episodes every month or two
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000]   with Italy coming next.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500]   So let's jump in and help you all start planning a trip
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.600]   right after this.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.520]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.680]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.120]   But one of his top hacks
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.600]   was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.040]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.900]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.560]   from Anyday, I am a total convert,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.640]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.940]   for this episode.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.980]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.240]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.600]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.240]   The cookware is 100% plastic free,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.160]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.720]   all in the same dish
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.520]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.160]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.340]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.980]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.040]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.960]   Okay, let's start with flights.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   One of the best carriers you can fly to Japan is A&A.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   Their product, everything from economy
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040]   to first-class is amazing.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.160]   One of the best ways to book it is on Virgin Atlantic,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.700]   at least right now, and I'll explain in a bit.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.780]   And you can do round trip from the West Coast
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.240]   for 60,000 miles in coach, 90,000 in business,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.300]   and 110,000 in first.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.740]   Again, that's round trip, so this is a really amazing deal.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.460]   You can only book it round trip,
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.660]   but the taxes, unlike using Virgin Atlantic miles
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.700]   to fly across the ocean to Europe,
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.780]   are much more reasonable, about $300.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.580]   So a couple caveats here.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.640]   You can't search for these flights on Virgin Atlantic.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.280]   So search on United or point.me
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.480]   or whatever other site you want within Star Alliance,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.140]   and you find the flights,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.700]   and then you need to call and book through Virgin Atlantic.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.820]   But you can transfer to Virgin Atlantic
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.860]   from Amex, CapOne, Chase, Citi, and Built,
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.220]   so it's a really great option.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.820]   The only catch here, though,
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.360]   is I don't know what'll happen after March
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.160]   because Virgin Atlantic has announced
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.440]   that they're joining the SkyTeam Alliance,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.420]   and ANA is in Star Alliance,
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.680]   so it's unclear whether they will continue partnering
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.700]   with some of these Star Alliance carriers.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   So if you're booking before March, it's an amazing option.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.860]   If you're booking after March
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.980]   or you don't wanna use Virgin Atlantic points
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.700]   for whatever reason, you can book direct through ANA.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.940]   It's actually a little cheaper,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.340]   but a little more complicated.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.900]   So you could do economy from the US
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.420]   for anywhere from 40 to 50,000 miles round trip.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.500]   You could do business from 75 to 90,000,
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.340]   and then you could do first class
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.980]   at around 150,000 points round trip.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.060]   So on the economy side and even the business side,
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.780]   it could be even cheaper.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.220]   Similar to Virgin Atlantic, you can only book round trip.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.200]   Taxes are about $300,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   but you can only transfer to ANA from Amex,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.340]   and those transfers take a few days,
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.540]   and you can very rarely get the agent from ANA
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.660]   on the phone to put something on hold,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.020]   so it's a little bit of a risky proposition.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.300]   So if you're really flexible on dates
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.100]   and you have Amex points, you could probably transfer them,
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.580]   and if in the couple days the transfer takes,
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.940]   those flights disappear and there's no more availability,
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.820]   well, you can always keep looking,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.460]   but if you're really set on a specific set of dates
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.180]   and there isn't a lot of availability,
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.740]   it can be a little risky.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.100]   Obviously, if you could call and get them to put it on hold,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.140]   I've heard some people have success doing that.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.820]   I would certainly try before you transfer,
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.440]   but it's not something that they advertise as doing.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.420]   Another great option is flying on JAL, Japan Airlines,
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.820]   another really great high-quality product.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.180]   Notice that the products from non-US carriers
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.820]   tend to always be a little bit better
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.340]   than the US carriers' products.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.380]   Because JAL's not a transfer partner
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.260]   of any of the credit card points programs,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.040]   I'll focus on booking it from other airlines.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.780]   So you could book it from Alaska at 35,000 miles each way
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.660]   in coach, 60,000 each way in business,
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.900]   and 70,000 to 80,000 each way in first,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.260]   and the taxes are pretty reasonable.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.660]   They can be as low as $100 round trip,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.440]   but Alaska's not a transfer partner
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.940]   of any of the major credit card programs.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.900]   So unless you have a lot of Alaska points
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.500]   or you sign up for the Alaska card,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.580]   which currently has a 70,000 mile bonus,
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.740]   unfortunately, I don't have a link,
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.580]   but if you can find one online,
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.280]   you can also use those Alaska miles
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.540]   for a similar price to fly on American,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.980]   who also flies to Japan.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.540]   But if you can find availability on JAL,
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.600]   it's gonna be a better experience.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.140]   Now, if you have American miles,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.340]   you can also book JAL or American
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.380]   for about the same number of points
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.620]   and about the same number of taxes.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.540]   AA is a transfer partner of BILT, but that's it.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.360]   So if you have BILT points or American points, that's great.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.220]   There is an American card
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.500]   with a 65,000 point signup bonus.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   I don't have a link for it,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.360]   but you're welcome to search for it online.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.540]   So the signup bonuses from the cards,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.600]   if you don't already have points,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.780]   there might be enough to get you
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.780]   one round trip ticket in economy.
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.700]   But if you don't already have points in those programs,
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.900]   it's gonna be tough.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.180]   British Airways, however, is a transfer partner
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.780]   of a lot of different credit card companies,
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.340]   and you can use their points to book on American or JAL,
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.620]   but the taxes and fuel SAR charges can be high.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.220]   So I'd say take a look, see what they are,
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.580]   and see if it's worth doing, but a lot of times it's not.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.780]   Now, another interesting option is on Singapore,
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.780]   which happens to fly what's called a Fifth Freedom flight,
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   which is where a carrier flies between two countries
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.280]   that aren't actually where it's predominantly based.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.420]   So they have a flight from LAX to Singapore,
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.500]   and you can book it direct from Singapore with miles
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.260]   that you can transfer to from Chase, Amex, Citi, and Cap One.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.880]   It's not cheap.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.500]   It can be about 120,000 points in first.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.780]   However, the Singapore product is hands down
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.100]   one of the best out there.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.060]   So I would even put it above ANA or JAL.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.860]   So if you're looking for a flight from LAX,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.260]   it could be a really great opportunity.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.120]   And sometimes those flights in business
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.180]   can actually be really, really reasonable,
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.660]   especially if you're booking last minute.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.640]   Last, I'll cover an option
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   that's a little bit more accessible,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.220]   which is booking on United.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.080]   You can use United points or Air Canada points,
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.100]   and it's actually not totally unreasonable.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.700]   I just looked for the next month,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.420]   and you can book flights at about 35,000 points
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.300]   each way in coach, 75,000 points each way in business,
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.860]   a little bit more than all the previous options,
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.980]   but you can transfer points to Air Canada or United
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.220]   from almost every single program.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.140]   So it's much easier for you to find availability,
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.220]   and the taxes can be as low as $50 round trip.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.160]   So you're really just spending points.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.460]   Also, depending on where you have points,
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.780]   let's say it's a cap one,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.440]   you could actually get a better deal
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.460]   on some of these flights if you're booking through Avianca.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.300]   So consider that as another option as well.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.140]   I will say that a lot of the availability
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.660]   that United has shows up last minute.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.300]   So these are really great options
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.060]   if you're booking really last minute.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.300]   I'm looking right now,
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.700]   and if you book these flights in February,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.900]   or maybe even early March,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.380]   there's a ton of availability.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.580]   But if you push out and look May, June, July, August,
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.540]   it's really hard to find good dates.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.460]   You can on United go and search,
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.500]   say use miles, flexible dates,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.240]   and you can get a calendar view.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.520]   You can choose whether you wanna be searching
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.060]   for economy or business,
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.280]   and then search on the calendar view, and you can look.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.620]   But I just found a handful of dates where you can go,
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.460]   especially in economy, much easier
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.820]   for as low as 35,000 points each way.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.660]   And it's really easy to get points
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.100]   into Star Alliance carrier like Air Canada or United,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.140]   where you can book those United flights.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.340]   And I think that's really accessible.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.380]   And right now, while there's not a great signup bonus
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.460]   on any United cards, 50, 60,000 points,
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.140]   it's been a lot better in the past.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.380]   There is a huge signup bonus on the Aeroplan card,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.560]   which is 100,000 points right now.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.260]   It does require a pretty high minimum spend of $20,000,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.780]   but 100,000 point signup bonus is huge.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.700]   I do have a link to that at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.700]   if you're interested.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.060]   So just to recap, the best option if it's available for you
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.660]   is gonna be to book through Virgin Atlantic.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.980]   You can transfer from every single program,
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.180]   and you can put those reservations on hold on the phone.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.940]   So first, go to a site like United or point.me
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.060]   and start searching to see if you can find
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.120]   good availability on ANA.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.460]   Call up Virgin.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.260]   And by the way, if you're using point.me,
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.780]   they will walk you through every single step of this.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.020]   And then call up Virgin, ask them to put it on hold.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.260]   Obviously, you'll need to create a Virgin Atlantic account
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.060]   before this and get a number.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.440]   But then you can put it on hold, transfer the points.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.340]   Depending on where your points are,
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.340]   it can take anywhere from Instant at Chase or Built.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.820]   It could take a couple days on Amex or Citi,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.100]   but you should be able to get the points there
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.980]   in less time than it takes to transfer.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.900]   So I think that's a really great option.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.740]   Aside from that, if you have a lot of Chase points,
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.540]   you're probably gonna get the best transferring
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.180]   to United or Air Canada and booking there.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.580]   But I would look at British Airways
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.660]   and see if it's worth booking something there
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.700]   on JAL or American.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.980]   Just keep an eye out for what the fuel surcharges
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.620]   and the fees are gonna be.
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.720]   If you've got Amex, I would say take a look
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.500]   at Air Canada also, but also look at ANA,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.320]   especially if you have some flexibility,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.620]   or even Singapore, if you're flying out of LA
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.060]   or you can change planes there.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.220]   There are a bunch of sign-up bonuses.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.500]   I will say the links I have at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.400]   on the personal cards aren't the best right now.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.900]   And I always say get the most points you can.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.180]   I'll put a link to where you can find some referral bonuses.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.660]   They're not my referrals, but they're someone else's.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.820]   And that's 150,000 for platinum and 90,000 for gold.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.580]   On the business side though,
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.180]   the business platinum card will get you 120,000 points.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.220]   That link on allthehacks.com/cards is the best I could find.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.300]   But on the business gold card,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.700]   there's a huge 130,000 point sign-up bonus right now
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.740]   that's through referrals.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.600]   And actually you can get the best one from calling Amex.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.120]   So I'll put a phone number in there.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.180]   I just called and asked and I got an offer
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.340]   for 130,000 point sign-up bonus,
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.420]   plus 10,000 if I add an authorized cardholder.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.240]   So those are some options on the business side.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.360]   If you're on Cap One, your best options
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   are gonna be to transfer to Air Canada,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.640]   British Airways, or Singapore.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.160]   And if you need some extra points to boost that balance,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.160]   the Venture and the VentureX cards are at 75,000 right now.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.760]   The Spark Miles card is at 50,000.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.240]   That's a business card.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.020]   And then the Spark Cash is at 100,000.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.440]   However, I'll just caveat that when you have a Capital One
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.280]   card that earns cash back,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.320]   you can't actually transfer that cash back to Miles
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.400]   unless you also have a card with Miles.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.920]   So if you've got a Venture or VentureX
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.720]   and you get the Spark Cash Plus card,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.400]   you can get that $1,000 sign-up bonus
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.360]   and transfer it in to be 100,000 points.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.220]   Or if you go to a Capital One branch
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.520]   and you can find someone,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.960]   there is an unlisted card, you can't sign up for it online.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.680]   It's called the VentureX Business.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.720]   It used to be the Spark Travel Elite,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.000]   and it has a crazy 250,000 points sign-up bonus
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.800]   after spending $50,000.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.940]   Yes, that's a lot of spend, but it's also a huge bonus.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.680]   So if you have a business and you have a lot of spend,
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.240]   it might be worth trying to find a Capital One
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.400]   rep at a branch or even calling around,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.560]   or I've heard people pinging people on LinkedIn
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.100]   'cause that's a huge sign-up bonus.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.520]   If you've got Built Points, you are in luck
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.720]   because American has some really great redemption options
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   and you can transfer Built to American,
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.360]   but you can also go to United, Air Canada, or Virgin.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.560]   However, there is no bonus on Built,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.880]   so you won't get a sign-up bonus when you sign up,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.080]   but you are welcome to use my referral link.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   It's just allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.440]   Finally, if you're in the city ecosystem,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   Virgin's gonna be a great option,
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.640]   but I'd also take a look at Avios or Singapore.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   And the city premiere bonus drop down from 80 to 60,000,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.160]   but that's really your best bet right now
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.220]   if you need to boost that balance is a city premiere card.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.600]   So if you need any of those cards,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.360]   you can obviously get most of the links
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.800]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.740]   I'll put some links in the show notes, and that's great.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.240]   You all know this sound, right?
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.360]   It's the best kind of notification,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.520]   the sound of another sale on Shopify
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.800]   and the moment another business dream becomes a reality.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.760]   Shopify is the commerce platform
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.400]   revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.180]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.520]   Whether you're selling Japanese tea or custom travel guides,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   both of which I would have loved to share in this episode,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.880]   Shopify simplifies selling online and in-person
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   so you can focus on successfully growing your business.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.840]   And they even let you sell across social media marketplaces
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.440]   like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.320]   What's incredible to me about Shopify
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   is that no matter how big you wanna grow,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.020]   Shopify is there to empower you
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.360]   with the confidence and control
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.660]   to take your business to the next level.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.200]   Now it's your turn to get serious
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.500]   about starting your business and try Shopify today.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.200]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period

[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.160]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.660]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.260]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.680]   in your situation,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.280]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.560]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.420]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.560]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.660]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.100]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.500]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.460]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.780]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.900]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.260]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.980]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.780]   are first generation wealth,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.860]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.000]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.340]   and learn from each other
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.940]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.220]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.560]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.980]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.140]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.100]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.580]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.020]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.660]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.140]   So many of these conversations
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.340]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.020]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.880]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.060]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.120]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.260]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.780]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.720]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.300]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.500]   Another option for flights
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.620]   which has nothing to do with points and miles
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.720]   is a new airline called Zip Air.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.980]   My understanding is they're a subsidiary of JL.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.180]   I've talked to one listener
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.660]   who said they had a good experience flying them,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.820]   and the reason why it's interesting
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.060]   is because it's incredibly affordable.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.900]   However, there's a couple caveats.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.000]   First, they only fly out of San Jose and LAX,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and that San Jose flight is so brand new,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.620]   I didn't even realize it was out
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.160]   until I just started doing the research this morning,
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.800]   but it's awesome news because I found flights in coach
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.740]   for under $600 round trip,
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.180]   and then in business, paid business,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.120]   found flights for around $2,000 round trip.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.900]   Now, yes, that's a lot more expensive,
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.780]   and you could probably fly three people for that cost,
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.580]   but I've never seen any other carrier
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.700]   come close to that price for international business.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.320]   A couple other caveats, the biggest being
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.720]   they have no ability to change your plans.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.420]   So I actually called customer service just to confirm,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.540]   and they said, "There are no change fees.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.380]   "If you can't take the flight, you just lose the money,"
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.740]   and I think that's crazy,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.160]   but that's just the way this airline operates,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.100]   so I would, if you're booking on that,
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.020]   definitely consider whether it makes sense
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.820]   to buy cancel-for-any-reason flight insurance.
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.100]   You could search CFAR
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.060]   is what it's often labeled as on the internet.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.720]   There's a policy that I looked at
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.460]   when we were thinking about going to Japan
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.140]   from Trawick International,
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.920]   which is the only place I bought travel insurance
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.900]   from recently that covers cancel-for-any-reason,
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.880]   so that's one major, major, major caveat,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.460]   and by the way, those insurance policies
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.460]   don't cover 100% of your cost.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.420]   They usually give you back 75%,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.260]   so there's still some risk there,
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.660]   and a few other caveats.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.580]   One, you can't fly with kids under six in business,
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.860]   so that's just not an option,
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.540]   unlike almost every other airline
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.220]   that doesn't have a problem with that,
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.140]   and then nothing is included other than your seat,
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.260]   so even if you're spending a few thousand dollars
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.480]   for business class, you still have to pay
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.840]   50 to $70 to check your bag.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.640]   That's in economy also.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.160]   You have to pay an extra $50
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.580]   if you wanna have a carry-on
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.080]   that's a little heavier than the limit they give you,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.520]   and then you have to pay another 11 or $12 per meal
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.940]   per flight to be able to eat on the plane
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.340]   if you don't wanna bring your own food,
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.360]   so yes, there's a bunch of little add-ons.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.240]   Yes, there's a bunch of restrictions,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.120]   but if you can commit to dates and make it work,
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.400]   a flight round trip and coach for under 600
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.740]   or business for about 2,000 is incredible.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.980]   You have to find your own way to San Jose or LA
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.020]   if you don't already live there,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.340]   'cause obviously they don't fly anywhere else in the US,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.580]   but I think it could be a really great option
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.640]   if you're looking to save money
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.060]   and you wanna get to Japan.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.440]   So next, I wanna quickly talk about hotels,
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.740]   and I'll cover the four major programs
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.460]   that you can book through points.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.060]   I'll start with Hyatt.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.220]   Hyatt has 33 hotels in Japan.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.780]   They range from category two at 6,500 points a night
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.100]   all the way up to category eight,
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.000]   which is 35,000 points a night,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.100]   and there are a bunch of amazing options.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.320]   So you've got the Park Hyatt in Tokyo,
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.660]   which was famous in the movie "Lost in Translation."
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.960]   The Park Hyatt Kyoto opened recently.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.840]   We just talked about it with Brandon.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.300]   It is incredible.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.960]   We stayed there on our last trip,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.380]   and it was really amazing.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.600]   Highly, highly, highly recommend.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.680]   There's a couple great options.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.060]   The Grand Hyatt and the Andaz in Tokyo look great.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.280]   I haven't stayed there.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.620]   The Kasara and the Park Hyatt in Niseko look amazing
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.020]   if you're heading there.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.780]   And then there's a Sawaka Hotel in Kyoto,
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.860]   which also looks amazing.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.060]   There's a bunch of other hotels.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.060]   Those are the ones that caught my eyes.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.900]   And as many of you know,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.100]   Hyatt's a transfer partner of Chase and Bilt.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.460]   So if you don't have Hyatt points,
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.060]   but you do have points in Chase or Bilt,
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.220]   you can get them there.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.940]   And if you don't and you really need some Hyatt points,
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.040]   you got a few options.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.980]   You can open up any of the Chase Ultimate Rewards cards.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.820]   So either the Chase Sapphire cards,
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.120]   which have a 60,000 point bonus now,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.340]   or if you're eligible for a business card,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.700]   the Inc Unlimited and Cash cards,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.220]   similar to how I just described earlier,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.700]   the cashback cards at Capital One work,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.120]   same thing is true at Chase.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.220]   So if you get an Inc Unlimited or an Inc Cash,
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.220]   you can take the cash back
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.140]   and you can convert those to points
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.100]   if you have a transferable points card
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.460]   like the Chase Sapphire or the Inc Business Preferred.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.700]   The Inc Business Preferred, by the way,
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.220]   has a 100,000 point signup bonus right now.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.820]   Obviously you do need to have a business,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.420]   but keep in mind that a business
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.180]   can include sole proprietorship stuff.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.780]   So if you sell stuff on eBay, if you drive for Lyft,
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.260]   if you've done any of those things,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.060]   you do some consulting on the side, that can all count.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.740]   And I know I've had business cards
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.280]   for long before I had an LLC registered business.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.860]   You can also get a Hyatt card.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.640]   The personal card only has a 30,000 point signup bonus,
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.300]   and it's been at as high as 60 in the past,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.420]   but the business card does have a 60,000 point
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.620]   signup bonus right now.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.580]   All the links to those, all the hacks.com/cards,
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.300]   really great options in Hyatt.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.340]   One of my favorite ways to use points to book hotels,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.440]   especially 'cause I have a lot of Chase points.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.820]   Next I'll talk about Bonvoy.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.860]   So Marriott has a great option,
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.620]   which is they do fifth night free.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.420]   So when you're looking at hotels,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.300]   they have 85 hotels in Japan
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.500]   that range from 15 to 120,000 points a night,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.100]   at least for some sample dates I searched.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.500]   But like I said, with fifth night free,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.180]   that 120,000 points can actually go down
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.760]   to about 96,000 points.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.420]   And that's true at every stop along the spectrum.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.380]   The only one I've stayed at personally
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.540]   is the St. Regis in Osaka, and it was a great experience.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.200]   But as I browsed through and thought about
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.900]   where I would stay in the future,
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.540]   in Tokyo, the Prince Gallery and the addition
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.000]   look fantastic.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.960]   The Mitsui in Kyoto looks fantastic.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.700]   And all of the Ritz-Carlton's,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.980]   Tokyo, Kyoto, Okinawa, Nikko, all look really incredible.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.760]   So if you're looking for some luxury hotels,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.060]   they look really, really great.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.640]   And there's Suiron Hotel, also looks really great.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.240]   It's in the luxury collection of Marriott.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.900]   But they also have a bunch of really affordable options.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.300]   There's a courtyard right at Tokyo Station.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.860]   So I think that there's a really great options here.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.560]   And as an example, I know I often say
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.380]   that some of these hotel points
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.100]   are hard to get a good value at,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.080]   but I just did a quick search at the Ritz-Carlton in Kyoto.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.820]   And for five nights, you could book for 360,000 points.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   So 72,000 points a night, but the room was $1,300 a night.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.440]   So you're getting about 1.85 cents per point,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.840]   which is an amazing value.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.000]   I think almost everyone online kind of says
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.400]   Marriott points are worth half to 0.7 cents.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.760]   So you can really actually get some outsized value here,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.460]   which could even make it worth
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.160]   transferring points to Marriott.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.320]   I know it's a one-to-one exchange,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.680]   but there are some redemptions like the one I just described
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.840]   that might make that worth it,
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.480]   especially if there's a transfer bonus.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.180]   Or just yesterday, Marriott really bumped up
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.560]   their signup bonuses.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.980]   The Bonvoy Bold, which is a no annual fee card,
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.520]   now has a 60,000 point signup bonus up from 30,000
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   and lets you earn an extra three points per dollar.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.120]   So 14 total at Marriott hotels.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.140]   But the Bonvoy Boundless, which has a $95 annual fee,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.960]   just added a 100,000 point signup bonus
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.280]   and gives you an extra six points per dollar at Marriott.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.240]   So 17 total, as well as an annual free night certificate
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.920]   and three Bonvoy points per dollar
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.480]   on gas, groceries, and dining.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.320]   So those are some great options
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.000]   for boosting your Marriott balance.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.520]   And you can find all those at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.660]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.400]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.220]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.840]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.380]   without our consent.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.320]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.280]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.120]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.680]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.800]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.780]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.040]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete Me from Avine,
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.360]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.280]   for this episode.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.080]   Delete Me is an amazing service
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.380]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.160]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.280]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.920]   and get that removed as well.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.860]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.240]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.560]   in their first two years,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.600]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.560]   for their customers.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.120]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.100]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.120]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.680]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.720]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.360]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.280]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.720]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.440]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.000]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.440]   to help protect your family
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.820]   and cross that important to do off your list,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.540]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.460]   for this episode.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.060]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.860]   to help you get a high-quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.020]   term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.260]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.820]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.820]   with great policies, like a million dollars in coverage
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.860]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.940]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   and you could be offered coverage instantly
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.140]   with no health exam required.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.180]   So, protect your family today with Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.060]   Apply today in just 10 minutes

[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.860]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.560]   not available in certain states,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.260]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.780]   (air whooshing)
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.860]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.340]   and supporting the show.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.180]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.900]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.660]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.200]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.

[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.460]   For Hilton, Hilton has 26 hotels in Japan.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.060]   They also have that same fifth night free program,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.380]   which is awesome.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.500]   All the hotels range from 25 to 95,000 points a night.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.340]   With one exception, there's this hotel called
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.660]   the Roku Kyoto, which looks ridiculous,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.780]   and it's 110,000 points a night.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.100]   In Tokyo, I've actually stayed at the Hilton twice,
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.460]   and I can confirm a couple of things.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.900]   One, great hotel.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.180]   It's not gonna blow your mind in any way.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.040]   It's just very, very solid.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.100]   They actually have a really cool little like mini onsen,
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   hot spring bath in the hotel, just randomly near the gym.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.540]   But the concierge is awesome.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.300]   So, one of the great things about having a high-end hotel
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.940]   in Tokyo is if you wanna go to any of the higher-end
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.500]   restaurants in Japan, you need to make reservations,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.060]   and many of them only accept reservations being made
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.440]   by an agency or a company or a hotel
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.980]   that they have a relationship with.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.740]   It's still very relationship-driven,
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.620]   and the concierge at the Hilton is great.
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.520]   You don't necessarily need to be staying
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.460]   at the hotel the whole time.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.500]   So, if you do need help with reservations,
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.440]   you could maybe stay a couple nights at a hotel
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.900]   that can help you and then change to another option.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.420]   While I haven't stayed at either,
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.020]   the Conrad Tokyo in Osaka I've heard great things about,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.820]   as well as the Odawara Resort.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.040]   And if you need some Hilton points,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.420]   they also just increased their sign-up bonuses
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.020]   on their credit cards yesterday.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.060]   So, I think right now must be prime season
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.220]   for hotel offers, given what Marriott also did.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.860]   You've got the basic Hilton card.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.460]   It has no annual fee,
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.220]   but it now has 100,000-point sign-up bonus,
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.080]   and you get 7x points at Hilton
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.960]   and 5x on gas, groceries, and dining.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.640]   Then you've got the Hilton Surpass,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.240]   with a huge 150,000-point sign-up bonus.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.460]   It has a $95 annual fee,
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.560]   but you get 12x points on Hilton,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.960]   6x on gas, groceries, and dining.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.720]   But you also get Hilton Gold status
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.640]   and an annual free night certificate,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.080]   but you have to spend 15,000 per year
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.160]   to get that certificate,
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.840]   so not sure if it'll be worth it.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.280]   Then finally, there's the Hilton Aspire,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.160]   which we just got a few months ago.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.080]   It also has 150,000-point sign-up bonus,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.120]   but a much higher annual fee at $450.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.600]   That said, it earns 14 points at Hilton
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.400]   and 7x points on flights and dining,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.100]   but what really sets it apart are the perks
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.280]   that I think can more than make up for that annual fee.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.920]   Every year, you get a free night
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.760]   at almost any Hilton property,
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.900]   and that includes things like the Waldorf in Park City,
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.300]   that includes the Conrad in Bora Bora,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.480]   some of the properties in the Maldives.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.520]   So, I mean, it's very valuable.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.320]   It's the same thing you get with the Surpass,
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.200]   but this time you don't have to spend 15,000 to get it.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.720]   You also get a $250 airline credit
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.040]   towards any airline fees like seats, bags, upgrades,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   food, et cetera.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.420]   You get priority pass lounge access
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.280]   and free Hilton Diamond status,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.120]   which is their top tier of status,
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.380]   and it gives you the best chance of an upgrade,
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.080]   and you get a daily food and beverage credit.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.100]   They also give you $100 property credit
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.140]   if you book a two-night stay at a Conrad or a Waldorf,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.480]   but it seems like that's gonna be harder to use,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.040]   so I don't really factor that in.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.280]   So, in short, some really big bonuses
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.000]   if you're looking for Hilton points.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.680]   The first two offers are on allthehacks.com/cards,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.760]   and obviously it really helps support the show
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.480]   when you use the links there,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.240]   but you won't find the last card,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.940]   the Hilton Aspire, on that page
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.080]   because there just isn't an offer there.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.160]   However, my wife Amy does have her referral link set up,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.680]   so if you wanna use that to get the Hilton Aspire,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.040]   she would appreciate it,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.560]   and you can find it at allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.800]   And then finally, with IHG Hotels,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.280]   they've got 45 hotels in Japan,
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.340]   and I know it's kind of often,
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.980]   I think of IHG as having a bunch of holiday inns
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.820]   and that kind of stuff,
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.900]   but there are a couple really nice intercons
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.760]   in Tokyo, Osaka, and a few other cities,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.740]   including one called the Intercontinental Beppu,
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.020]   which is a hot springs resort and looks really awesome.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.220]   And if you have an IHG Premier or Traveler card,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.460]   the Premier card, by the way, right now,
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.100]   has 175,000 points signup bonus.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.740]   It's on my cards page also.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.220]   You get fourth night free,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.020]   even better than fifth night free.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.100]   So definitely, if you're gonna book a couple stays
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.260]   for four nights or more in Japan
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.020]   or anywhere in the world, actually,
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.140]   it's probably worth having that IHG card
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.180]   'cause you'll get every fourth night you book
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.700]   at the same property free.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.140]   I do caveat that transferring points
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.500]   to a lot of these programs,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.340]   whether it's from Chase or Bilt to IHG
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.740]   or Amex or Chase to Marriott,
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.420]   I will say make sure it's a good deal
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.540]   because oftentimes the value of those points,
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.620]   you know, I gave you an example
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.820]   where you could get almost two cents from Marriott,
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.880]   but that's really hard.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.620]   Oftentimes, you might only be getting half a cent.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.120]   And I just think you're gonna get a lot better value
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.900]   transferring those points and using them with airlines.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.980]   The exception being Chase to Hyatt
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.220]   is often a pretty good deal.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.060]   So definitely worth considering there.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.020]   But I'm not saying it's not possible to find a good deal.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.460]   I just say do the math first
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.620]   to make sure that those points
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.340]   wouldn't be better spent on flights
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.620]   than they would on hotels.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.020]   Finally, if you don't have any hotel points,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.020]   obviously you can do some searching online.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.540]   I talked in the London episode
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.340]   about some of my experiences booking with Airbnb.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.980]   I've never booked an Airbnb in Japan,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.700]   but I will remind everyone that we do have a partnership
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.780]   that gets you at four and five star hotels,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.180]   perks like upgrades, free breakfast, resort credits,
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.940]   early check-in, late checkout, and that kind of stuff.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.340]   So if you are trying to book a high-end property,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.140]   definitely shoot an email to upgrade@allthehacks.com
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.620]   and I'll see if we can help you out
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.080]   and get you all those perks.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.900]   They're very similar to the perks you get
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.440]   from booking with through Amex at fine hotels and resorts
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.300]   or a lot of the hotel collections
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.580]   with your card companies and their portals,
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.020]   except two things.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.600]   One, I think we have about 4,000 hotels
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.660]   that we can do this with,
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.980]   and most of them are limited to hundreds or maybe 1,000.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.180]   And then separately,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.080]   we tend to work directly with the hotels.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.900]   So you're actually getting a reservation from Hyatt,
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.700]   not from Chase, which, you know,
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.940]   I always prefer booking direct.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.060]   So I think that could be helpful.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.480]   So that's an option.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.700]   And then two other things outside of luxury,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.100]   outside of points on the hotel side
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.860]   that I thought about sharing.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.020]   One, not a great option, either of them, by the way,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.580]   if you're traveling as a family or with kids,
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.900]   but I will say I've heard a handful of people
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.780]   who've done some solo traveling
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.480]   or even like early 20s traveling
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.140]   and stayed at hostels or capsule hotels
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.340]   or like little pod hotels in Japan.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.820]   And you'll notice Japan is a very clean place.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.740]   And so it's a very different experience.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.100]   And a lot of the reason these capsule hotels might exist
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.260]   is 'cause people are in Tokyo for business,
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.160]   they stay out late,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.840]   and they just wanna get some sleep and a shower
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.620]   before the next day so they can go to work
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.580]   and they don't have to commute all the way home.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.020]   So they're very functional and very clean places.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.360]   So I would definitely check that out
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.700]   if that meets the kind of travel you're doing,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.060]   you might be able to save.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.180]   And then when you're talking about taking those trips
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.100]   from Tokyo to Kyoto or Osaka,
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.300]   another option other than the train,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.900]   which can be expensive,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.500]   if you're looking to do it on a budget
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.340]   is to take an overnight bus.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.660]   And the reason I say this is because
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.180]   you save having to stay one night in a hotel.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.540]   Now, maybe a hostel is cheaper,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.540]   but some of these buses are really, really nice.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.060]   I'll link in the show notes to this company, Willer,
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.660]   who has named the chairs on their bus,
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.600]   the reborn is what they're actually called,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.260]   Willer's Reborn Seating.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.260]   And it looks very nice.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.960]   It's like 155 degree pitch.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.300]   So you're almost lie flat with walls on the side
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.040]   of your little seat cubby.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.660]   So definitely a good option
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.660]   if you can sleep in an environment like that
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.460]   and wanna save some money on a hotel
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.760]   when you're traveling between cities in Japan.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.180]   That's hotels.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.500]   I think that covers all of the ways
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.220]   to use points and miles to get there, to stay there.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.060]   If you have any tips that I missed, let me know
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.980]   and I'll pass them on to others.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.700]   I love Japan so much.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.160]   I'm already thinking, how do we take our next trip there,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.300]   which will be trip five for us.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.860]   And I'm just so excited.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.060]   So if you end up taking a trip, if any of this is helpful,
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.900]   let me know.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.120]   I'd love to share some wins
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.820]   and I'd love to hear how your experience is.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.660]   But I'm gonna leave it at that and I'll see you next week.
