[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.120]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.200]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and last week,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.480]   I had an amazing conversation with Brandon Presser
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.400]   about everything Japan.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.040]   Where to go, what to see, planning your trip,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.000]   the culture, and so much more.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.320]   But I didn't have the time to cover one more thing
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.940]   I really wanted to get to,
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.280]   how to use your points and miles to fly there,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.920]   and for hotels when you get there,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.120]   and also some ways to increase those points balances,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   and a few other ways to save on a trip
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.760]   even if you're not using points.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.780]   So I wanted to do an entire follow-up episode on that.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200]   But even if you're not planning a trip to Japan,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.880]   a lot of what I'm gonna talk about today
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.700]   will hopefully help you think about any trip you're taking,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.160]   or boosting miles and points
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.680]   that you might not know what you wanna do with yet.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.480]   But if you haven't heard that episode yet,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.720]   go back and have a listen,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.960]   because you might actually end up wanting to plan a trip
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.800]   to Japan sooner than you thought.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   In fact, I know a lot of you
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000]   have already started planning your trip
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   because I got so many amazing emails and DMs from you
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   about the Japan episode.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.840]   Haven't gotten to respond to everyone yet,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.140]   but I'm so happy you all enjoyed the episode.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.160]   I'm excited for your trips to Japan,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.840]   and I think I'll keep experimenting
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.200]   with having these country episodes every month or two,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000]   with Italy coming next.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500]   So let's jump in and help you all start planning a trip
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.880]   right after this.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   Okay, let's start with flights.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   One of the best carriers you can fly to Japan is A&A.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   Their product, everything from economy
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.280]   to first-class is amazing.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.400]   One of the best ways to book it is on Virgin Atlantic,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   at least right now, and I'll explain in a bit.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.000]   And you can do round trip from the West Coast
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.920]   for 60,000 miles in coach,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.520]   90,000 in business, and 110,000 in first.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.960]   Again, that's round trip, so this is a really amazing deal.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.680]   You can only book it round trip,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.880]   but the taxes, unlike using Virgin Atlantic miles
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.920]   to fly across the ocean to Europe,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.000]   are much more reasonable, about $300.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.800]   So a couple caveats here.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.860]   You can't search for these flights on Virgin Atlantic.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.480]   So search on United or point.me
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.700]   or whatever other site you want within Star Alliance,
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.360]   and you find the flights,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.920]   and then you need to call and book through Virgin Atlantic.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   But you can transfer to Virgin Atlantic from Amex,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120]   Cap One, Chase, Citi, and Built,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   so it's a really great option.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.040]   The only catch here, though,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.600]   is I don't know what'll happen after March,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.400]   because Virgin Atlantic has announced
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.680]   that they're joining the SkyTeam Alliance,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.680]   and ANA is in Star Alliance,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.920]   so it's unclear whether they will continue partnering
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.940]   with some of these Star Alliance carriers.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.960]   So if you're booking before March, it's an amazing option.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   If you're booking after March
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.240]   or you don't wanna use Virgin Atlantic points
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.220]   for whatever reason,
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.960]   you can book direct through ANA.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.200]   It's actually a little cheaper,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.600]   but a little more complicated.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.160]   So you could do economy from the US
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.660]   for anywhere from 40,000 to 50,000 miles round trip.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.740]   You could do business from 75,000 to 90,000,
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.560]   and then you could do first class
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200]   at around 150,000 points round trip.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.300]   So on the economy side and even the business side,
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.020]   it could be even cheaper.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.460]   Similar to Virgin Atlantic, you can only book round trip.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.440]   Taxes are about $300,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.500]   but you can only transfer to ANA from Amex,
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.580]   and those transfers take a few days,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.780]   and you can very rarely get the agent from ANA
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.900]   on the phone to put something on hold,
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.240]   so it's a little bit of a risky proposition.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.540]   So if you're really flexible on dates
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.740]   and you have Amex points,
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.300]   you could probably transfer them,
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.820]   and if in the couple days the transfer takes,
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.180]   those flights disappear and there's no more availability,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.060]   well, you can always keep looking,
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.780]   but if you're really set on a specific set of dates
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.460]   and there isn't a lot of availability,
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.980]   it can be a little risky.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.340]   Obviously, if you could call and get them to put it on hold,
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.420]   I've heard some people have success doing that.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.060]   I would certainly try before you transfer,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.700]   but it's not something that they advertise as doing.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.660]   Another great option is flying on JAL, Japan Airlines,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.020]   another really great high quality product.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.400]   Notice that the products from non-US carriers
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.060]   tend to always be a little bit better
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.580]   than the US carriers products.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.620]   Because JAL is not a transfer partner
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.500]   of any of the credit card points programs,
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.280]   I'll focus on booking it from other airlines.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.900]   So you could book it from Alaska
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.780]   at 35,000 miles each way in coach,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.900]   60,000 each way in business,
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.140]   and 70 to 80,000 each way in first.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.500]   And the taxes are pretty reasonable.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.900]   They can be as low as $100 round trip,
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.660]   but Alaska is not a transfer partner
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.180]   of any of the major credit card programs.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.140]   So unless you have a lot of Alaska points
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.740]   or you sign up for the Alaska card,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.820]   which currently has a 70,000 mile bonus,
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.960]   unfortunately, I don't have a link,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.820]   but if you can find one online,
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.500]   you can also use those Alaska miles
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.780]   for a similar price to fly on American,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.220]   who also flies to Japan.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.780]   But if you can find availability on JAL,
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.840]   it's gonna be a better experience.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.380]   Now, if you have American miles,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.580]   you can also book JAL or American
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.620]   for about the same number of points
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.860]   and about the same number of taxes.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.760]   AA is a transfer partner of BILT, but that's it.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.580]   So if you have BILT points or American points, that's great.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.740]   There is an American card with a 65,000 point signup bonus.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.740]   I don't have a link for it,
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.580]   but you're welcome to search for it online.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.780]   So the signup bonuses from the cards,
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.840]   if you don't already have points,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.020]   there might be enough to get you
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   one round trip ticket and economy.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.940]   But if you don't already have points in those programs,
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.140]   it's gonna be tough.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.420]   British Airways, however, is a transfer partner
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.020]   of a lot of different credit card companies,
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.580]   and you can use their points to book on American or JAL,
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.860]   but the taxes and fuel SAR charges can be high.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.460]   So I'd say take a look, see what they are,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.800]   and see if it's worth doing, but a lot of times it's not.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.000]   Now, another interesting option is on Singapore,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.020]   which happens to fly what's called a fifth freedom flight,
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.020]   which is where a carrier flies between two countries
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.520]   that aren't actually where it's predominantly based.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.660]   So they have a flight from LAX to Singapore,
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.740]   and you can book it direct from Singapore with miles
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.480]   that you can transfer to from Chase, Amex, Citi, and Cap One.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.120]   It's not cheap.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.720]   It can be about 120,000 points in first.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.040]   However, the Singapore product is hands down
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.320]   one of the best out there.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   So, you know, I would even put it above ANA or JAL.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.080]   So if you're looking for a flight from LAX,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.480]   it could be a really great opportunity.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.360]   And sometimes those flights in business
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.420]   can actually be really, really reasonable,
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.880]   especially if you're booking last minute.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   Last, I'll cover an option
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.080]   that's a little bit more accessible,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.480]   which is booking on United.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.320]   You can use United points or Air Canada points,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.340]   and it's actually not totally unreasonable.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.960]   I just looked for the next month,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.120]   and you can book flights at about 35,000 points each way
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.520]   in coach, 75,000 points each way in business,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.080]   a little bit more than all the previous options,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200]   but you can transfer points to Air Canada or United
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.440]   from almost every single program.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.360]   So it's much easier for you to find availability,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   and the taxes can be as low as $50 round trip.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.400]   So you're really just spending points.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.680]   Also, depending on where you have points,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.040]   let's say it's a Cap One,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.680]   you could actually get a better deal
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.700]   on some of these flights if you're booking through Avianca.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.540]   So consider that as another option as well.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.400]   I will say that a lot of the availability
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.900]   that United has shows up last minute.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.540]   So these are really great options
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.300]   if you're booking really last minute.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.540]   I'm looking right now,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.940]   and if you book these flights in February,
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.620]   or maybe even early March, there's a ton of availability,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.820]   but if you push out and look May, June, July, August,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.760]   it's really hard to find good dates.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.740]   You can on United go and search, say, use miles,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.480]   flexible dates, and you can get a calendar view.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.760]   You can choose whether you wanna be searching
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.300]   for economy or business,
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.540]   and then search on the calendar view, and you can look.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.860]   But I just found a handful of dates where you can go,
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.700]   especially in economy, much easier,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.060]   for as low as 35,000 points each way.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.900]   And it's really easy to get points
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.340]   into Star Alliance carrier like Air Canada or United,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.380]   where you can book those United flights.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.580]   And I think that's really accessible.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.620]   And right now, while there's not a great signup bonus
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.680]   on any United cards, 50, 60,000 points,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.360]   it's been a lot better in the past.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.600]   There is a huge signup bonus on the Aeroplan card,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.800]   which is 100,000 points right now.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.520]   It does require a pretty high minimum spend of $20,000,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.000]   but 100,000 point signup bonus is huge.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.920]   I do have a link to that at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.960]   if you're interested.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.320]   So just to recap, the best option if it's available for you
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   is gonna be to book through Virgin Atlantic.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.200]   You can transfer from every single program,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.380]   and you can put those reservations on hold on the phone.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.160]   So first, go to a site like United or point.me
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.280]   and start searching to see if you can find
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.680]   good availability on ANA, call up Virgin.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.480]   And by the way, if you're using point.me,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.000]   they will walk you through every single step of this,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.240]   and then call up Virgin, ask them to put it on hold.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.480]   Obviously, you'll need to create a Virgin Atlantic account
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.280]   before this and get a number,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.640]   but then you can put it on hold, transfer the points.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.520]   Depending on where your points are,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.560]   it can take anywhere from instant at Chase or Built.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.000]   It could take a couple days on Amex or Citi,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.280]   but you should be able to get the points there
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.200]   in less time than it takes to transfer.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.100]   So I think that's a really great option.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.940]   Aside from that, if you have a lot of Chase points,
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.760]   you're probably gonna get the best transferring
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.400]   to United or Air Canada and booking there.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.760]   But I would look at British Airways
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.840]   and see if it's worth booking something there
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   on JAL or American, just keep an eye out
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.840]   for what the fuel surcharges and the fees are gonna be.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.960]   If you've got Amex, I would say take a look
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.720]   at Air Canada also, but also look at ANA,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.680]   especially if you have some flexibility or even Singapore,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.280]   if you're flying out of LA or you can change planes there.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.440]   There are a bunch of signup bonuses.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.760]   I will say the links I have at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.640]   on the personal cards aren't the best right now.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.120]   And I always say get the most points you can.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.440]   I'll put a link to where you can find some referral bonuses.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.920]   They're not my referrals, but they're someone else's.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.080]   And that's 150,000 for platinum and 90,000 for gold.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.840]   On the business side though,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.420]   the business platinum card will get you 120,000 points.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.440]   That link on allthehacks.com/cards is the best I could find.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.560]   But on the business gold card,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.920]   there's a huge 130,000 point signup bonus right now
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.960]   that's through referrals.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.840]   And actually you can get the best one from calling Amex.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.360]   So I'll put a phone number in there.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.420]   I just called and asked and I got an offer
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.720]   for 130,000 point signup bonus plus 10,000
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.680]   if I add an authorized card holder.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.480]   So those are some options on the business side.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.900]   If you're on cap one,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.000]   your best options are gonna be to transfer to Air Canada,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.880]   British Airways, or Singapore.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.400]   And if you need some extra points to boost that balance,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   the Venture and the VentureX cards are at 75,000 right now.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.520]   The Spark Miles card is at 50,000, that's a business card.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.300]   And then the Spark Cash is at 100,000.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.640]   However, I'll just caveat that
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.560]   when you have a Capital One card that earns cash back,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.600]   you can't actually transfer that cash back to Miles
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   unless you also have a card with Miles.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.200]   So if you've got a Venture or VentureX
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.000]   and you get the Spark Cash Plus card,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.660]   you can get that $1,000 signup bonus
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.640]   and transfer it in to be 100,000 points.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.480]   Or if you go to a Capital One branch
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.460]   and you can find someone, there is an unlisted card.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.220]   You can't sign up for it online.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.960]   It's called the VentureX Business.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   It used to be the Spark Travel Elite
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.260]   and it has a crazy 250,000 point signup bonus
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.040]   after spending $50,000.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.200]   Yes, that's a lot of spend, but it's also a huge bonus.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.960]   So if you have a business and you have a lot of spend,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.840]   it might be worth trying to find a Capital One rep
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.680]   at a branch or even calling around,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.840]   or I've heard people pinging people on LinkedIn
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.360]   'cause that's a huge signup bonus.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   If you've got Built Points, you are in luck
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.960]   because American has some really great redemption options
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.000]   and you can transfer Built to American,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.640]   but you can also go to United, Air Canada, or Virgin.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.820]   However, there is no bonus on Built,
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.140]   so you won't get a signup bonus when you sign up,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.340]   but you are welcome to use my referral link.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.580]   It's just allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.740]   Finally, if you're in the city ecosystem,
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.700]   Virgin's gonna be a great option,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.900]   but I'd also take a look at Avios or Singapore.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.640]   And the city premier bonus dropped down from 80 to 60,000,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.400]   but that's really your best bet right now
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.460]   if you need to boost that balance is a city premier card.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.840]   So if you need any of those cards,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.580]   you can obviously get most of the links
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.020]   at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.980]   I'll put some links in the show notes, and that's great.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.380]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.900]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.780]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.860]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.820]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.740]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.460]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.280]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.140]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.540]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.520]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.000]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.060]   that you got through another week.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.180]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.700]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.500]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.580]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.220]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.820]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.780]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.820]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.660]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.720]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.360]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.840]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.480]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.760]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.780]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.020]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.140]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.640]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.240]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   in your situation,
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.280]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.560]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.400]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.560]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.080]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.480]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.440]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.040]   and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.880]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.240]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.960]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.760]   are first generation wealth,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.840]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.000]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.320]   and learn from each other
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.920]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.200]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.540]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.960]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.100]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.580]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.020]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.360]   to your children's education,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.680]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.120]   So many of these conversations
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.360]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.000]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.880]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.040]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.120]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.240]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.760]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.720]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.300]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.480]   Another option for flights
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.600]   which has nothing to do with points and miles
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.720]   is a new airline called Zip Air.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.960]   My understanding is they're a subsidiary of JAL.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.180]   I've talked to one listener
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.640]   who said they had a good experience flying them,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.800]   and the reason why it's interesting
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.060]   is because it's incredibly affordable.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.880]   However, there's a couple caveats.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.000]   First, they only fly out of San Jose and LAX,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.980]   and that San Jose flight is so brand new,
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.600]   I didn't even realize it was out
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.160]   until I just started doing the research this morning,
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.780]   but it's awesome news because I found flights in coach
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.720]   for under $600 round trip,
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.180]   and then in business, paid business,
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.120]   found flights for around $2,000 round trip.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.880]   Now, yes, that's a lot more expensive,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.760]   and you could probably fly three people for that cost,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.560]   but I've never seen any other carrier
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.680]   come close to that price for international business.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.320]   A couple other caveats, the biggest being
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.720]   they have no ability to change your plans.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.400]   So I actually called customer service just to confirm,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.520]   and they said, "There are no change fees.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.360]   "If you can't take the flight, you just lose the money,"
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.720]   and I think that's crazy,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.160]   but that's just the way this airline operates.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.120]   So I would, if you're booking on that,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.040]   definitely consider whether it makes sense
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.800]   to buy cancel-for-any-reason flight insurance.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.080]   You could search CFAR
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.060]   is what it's often labeled as on the internet.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.720]   There's a policy that I looked at
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.440]   when we were thinking about going to Japan
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.120]   from Trawick International,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.920]   which is the only place I bought travel insurance
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.880]   from recently that covers cancel-for-any-reason.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   So that's one major, major, major caveat.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.440]   And by the way, those insurance policies
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   don't cover 100% of your cost.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.400]   They usually give you back 75%,
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.240]   so there's still some risk there.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   And a few other caveats.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.560]   One, you can't fly with kids under six in business,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.860]   so that's just not an option,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.520]   unlike almost every other airline
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.240]   that doesn't have a problem with that.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.140]   And then nothing is included other than your seat.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.240]   So even if you're spending a few thousand dollars
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.360]   for business class,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.820]   you still have to pay 50 to $70 to check your bag.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.620]   That's economy also.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.160]   You have to pay an extra $50
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.560]   if you wanna have a carry-on
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.040]   that's a little heavier than the limit they give you.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.480]   And then you have to pay another $11 or $12 per meal
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.920]   per flight to be able to eat on the plane
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.320]   if you don't wanna bring your own food.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.340]   So yes, there's a bunch of little add-ons.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.240]   Yes, there's a bunch of restrictions.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.120]   But if you can commit to dates and make it work,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.400]   a flight round trip and coach for under 600
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.720]   or business for about 2,000 is incredible.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.960]   You have to find your own way to San Jose or LA
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.000]   if you don't already live there,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.340]   'cause obviously they don't fly anywhere else in the US.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.560]   But I think it could be a really great option
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.640]   if you're looking to save money
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.040]   and you wanna get to Japan.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.440]   So next, I wanna quickly talk about hotels
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.720]   and I'll cover the four major programs
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.440]   that you can book through points.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.040]   I'll start with Hyatt.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.220]   Hyatt has 33 hotels in Japan.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.760]   They range from category two at 6,500 points a night
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.080]   all the way up to category eight,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.000]   which is 35,000 points a night.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.080]   And there are a bunch of amazing options.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.320]   So you've got the Park Hyatt in Tokyo,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.640]   which was famous in the movie "Lost in Translation."
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.940]   The Park Hyatt Kyoto opened recently.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.820]   We just talked about it with Brandon.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.280]   It is incredible.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.360]   We stayed there on our last trip and it was really amazing.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.600]   Highly, highly, highly recommend.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.660]   There's a couple of great options.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.060]   The Grand Hyatt and the Andaz in Tokyo look great.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.260]   I haven't stayed there.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.600]   The Kasara and the Park Hyatt in Niseko look amazing
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.020]   if you're heading there.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.780]   And then there's a Sawaka Hotel in Kyoto,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.840]   which also looks amazing.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.040]   There's a bunch of other hotels.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   Those are the ones that caught my eyes.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.880]   And as many of you know,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.100]   Hyatt's a transfer partner of Chase and Bilt.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.440]   So if you don't have Hyatt points,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.040]   but you do have points in Chase or Bilt,
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.200]   you can get them there.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.920]   And if you don't and you really need some Hyatt points,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.040]   you got a few options.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.980]   You can open up any of the Chase Ultimate Rewards cards.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.800]   So either the Chase Sapphire cards,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.120]   which have a 60,000 point bonus now,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.340]   or if you're eligible for a business card,
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.680]   the Inc Unlimited and Cash cards.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.200]   Similar to how I just described earlier,
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.680]   the cashback cards at Capital One work.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.080]   Same thing is true at Chase.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.200]   So if you get an Inc Unlimited or an Inc Cash,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   you can take the cash back
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.120]   and you can convert those to points
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.080]   if you have a transferable points card
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.440]   like the Chase Sapphire or the Inc Business Preferred.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.700]   The Inc Business Preferred, by the way,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.240]   has a 100,000 point signup bonus right now.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.840]   Obviously you do need to have a business,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.440]   but keep in mind that a business
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.200]   can include sole proprietorship stuff.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.820]   So if you sell stuff on eBay, if you drive for Lyft,
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.280]   if you've done any of those things,
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.080]   you do some consulting on the side, that can all count.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.760]   And I know I've had business cards
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.300]   for long before I had an LLC registered business.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.880]   You can also get a Hyatt card.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.680]   The personal card only has a 30,000 point signup bonus,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.320]   and it's been at as high as 60 in the past,
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.540]   but the business card does have
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.640]   a 60,000 point signup bonus right now.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.600]   All the links to those, allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.320]   Really great options in Hyatt.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.360]   One of my favorite ways to use points to book hotels,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.460]   especially 'cause I have a lot of Chase points.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.840]   Next, I'll talk about Bonvoy.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.880]   So Marriott has a great option,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.640]   which is they do fifth night free.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.440]   So when you're looking at hotels,
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.320]   they have 85 hotels in Japan
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.520]   that range from 15 to 120,000 points a night,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.120]   at least for some sample dates I searched.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.480]   But like I said, with fifth night free,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.160]   that 120,000 points can actually go down
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.760]   to about 96,000 points.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.440]   And that's true at every stop along the spectrum.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.360]   The only one I've stayed at personally
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.520]   is the St. Regis in Osaka, and it was a great experience.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.200]   But as I browsed through and thought about
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.880]   where I would stay in the future,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.000]   in Tokyo, the Prince Gallery and the Addition look fantastic.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.960]   The Mitsui in Kyoto looks fantastic.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.680]   And all of the Ritz-Carlton's,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.960]   Tokyo, Kyoto, Okinawa, Nikko, all look really incredible.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.760]   So if you're looking for some luxury hotels,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.040]   they look really, really great.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.640]   And there's Suiron Hotel, also looks really great.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.240]   It's in the luxury collection of Marriott.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.880]   But they also have a bunch of really affordable options.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.280]   There's a courtyard right at Tokyo Station.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.840]   So I think that there's a really great options here.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.520]   And as an example, I know I often say
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.320]   that some of these hotel points
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.040]   are hard to get a good value at,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   but I just did a quick search at the Ritz-Carlton in Kyoto.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.760]   And for five nights, you could book for 360,000 points.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.920]   So 72,000 points a night.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.320]   But the room was $1,300 a night.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.400]   So you're getting about 1.85 cents per point,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.800]   which is an amazing value.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.880]   I think almost everyone online kind of says Marriott points
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.360]   are worth half to 0.7 cents.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.720]   So you can really actually get some outsized value here,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.400]   which could even make it worth
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.160]   transferring points to Marriott.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.320]   I know it's a one-to-one exchange,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.720]   but there are some redemptions like the one
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.840]   I just described that might make that worth it,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   especially if there's a transfer bonus.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.760]   Or just yesterday,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.560]   Marriott really bumped up their signup bonuses.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.960]   The Bonvoy Bold, which is a no annual fee card,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.480]   now has a 60,000 point signup bonus up from 30,000
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   and lets you earn an extra three points per dollar.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.120]   So 14 total at Marriott hotels.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   But the Bonvoy Boundless, which has a $95 annual fee,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.960]   just added a 100,000 point signup bonus
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.280]   and gives you an extra six points per dollar at Marriott.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.240]   So 17 total, as well as an annual free night certificate
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   and three Bonvoy points per dollar
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.480]   on gas, groceries, and dining.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.280]   So those are some great options
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.000]   for boosting your Marriott balance.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.480]   And you can find all those at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.640]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.400]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.200]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.820]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.360]   without our consent.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.300]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.260]   that had his name, age, address, phone number, email,
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.120]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.700]   And that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.840]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.680]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.800]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.040]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.000]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.320]   with them for this episode.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.400]   and remove your personal information
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.180]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.280]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.940]   and get that removed as well.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.880]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.240]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.600]   in their first two years.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.640]   And to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.560]   for their customers.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.120]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.160]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.680]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.660]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.740]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.380]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.300]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.740]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.460]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.020]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.460]   to help protect your family
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.820]   and cross that important to-do off your list,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.260]   and I'm excited to be partnering
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.460]   with them for this episode.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.060]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.540]   to help you get a high-quality,
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.300]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.940]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.860]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.300]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.820]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.820]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.860]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.020]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.940]   and you could be offered coverage instantly
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.140]   with no health exam required.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.180]   So protect your family today with Fabric by Gerber Life.

[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.540]   not available in certain states,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.240]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.860]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.420]   For Hilton, Hilton has 26 hotels in Japan.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.020]   They also have that same fifth night free program,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.340]   which is awesome.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.460]   All the hotels range from 25 to 95,000 points a night.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.380]   With one exception,
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.380]   there's this hotel called the Roku Kyoto,
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.760]   which looks ridiculous and it's 110,000 points a night.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.060]   In Tokyo, I've actually stayed at the Hilton twice
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.460]   and I can confirm a couple of things.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.900]   One, great hotel.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.160]   It's not gonna blow your mind in any way.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.020]   It's just very, very solid.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.080]   They actually have a really cool little like mini onsen,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.100]   hot spring bath in the hotel, just randomly near the gym.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.520]   But the concierge is awesome.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.980]   So one of the great things
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.920]   about having a high-end hotel in Tokyo
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.480]   is if you wanna go to any of the higher end restaurants
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.460]   in Japan, you need to make reservations.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.060]   And many of them only accept reservations being made
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.420]   by an agency or a company or a hotel
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.980]   that they have a relationship with.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.700]   It's still very relationship driven
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.620]   and the concierge at the Hilton is great.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.500]   You don't necessarily need to be staying
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.440]   at the hotel the whole time.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.500]   So if you do need help with reservations,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.420]   you could maybe stay a couple nights at a hotel
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.920]   that can help you and then change to another option.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.460]   While I haven't stayed at either,
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.060]   the Conrad Tokyo in Osaka, I've heard great things about,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.860]   as well as the Odawara Resort.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.060]   And if you need some Hilton points,
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.440]   they also just increased their signup bonuses
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.060]   on their credit cards yesterday.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.100]   So I think right now must be prime season
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.220]   for hotel offers given what Marriott also did.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.500]   You've got the basic Hilton card, it has no annual fee,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.240]   but it now has a 100,000 point signup bonus
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.060]   and you get seven X points at Hilton
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.940]   and five X on gas, groceries, and dining.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.640]   Then you've got the Hilton Surpass
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.220]   with a huge 150,000 point signup bonus.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.540]   It has a $95 annual fee, but you get 12 X points on Hilton,
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.940]   six X on gas, groceries, and dining,
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.660]   but you also get Hilton gold status
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.580]   and an annual free night certificate,
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.020]   but you have to spend 15,000 per year
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.100]   to get that certificate.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.780]   So not sure if it'll be worth it.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.220]   Then finally, there's the Hilton Aspire,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.140]   which we just got a few months ago.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.060]   It also has 150,000 points signup bonus,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.100]   but a much higher annual fee at $450.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.600]   That said, it earns 14 points at Hilton
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.380]   and seven X points on flights and dining.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.080]   But what really sets it apart are the perks
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.260]   that I think can more than make up for that annual fee.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.900]   Every year, you get a free night
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.740]   at almost any Hilton property.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.900]   And that includes things like the Waldorf in Park City,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.300]   that includes the Conrad in Bora Bora,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.460]   some of the properties in the Maldives.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.520]   So, I mean, it's very valuable.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.300]   It's the same thing you get with the Surpass,
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.180]   but this time you don't have to spend 15,000 to get it.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.700]   You also get a $250 airline credit
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.860]   towards any airline fees like seats,
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.540]   bags, upgrades, food, et cetera.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.400]   You get priority pass lounge access
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.260]   and free Hilton Diamond status,
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.120]   which is their top tier of status.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.360]   And it gives you the best chance of an upgrade
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.040]   and you get a daily food and beverage credit.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.080]   They also give you $100 property credit
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.120]   if you book a two night stay at a Conrad or a Waldorf,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.480]   but it seems like that's gonna be harder to use.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.040]   So I don't really factor that in.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.280]   So in short, some really big bonuses
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.000]   if you're looking for Hilton points.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.680]   The first two offers are on allthehacks.com/cards
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.760]   and obviously it really helps support the show
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.460]   when you use the links there,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.220]   but you won't find the last card,
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.940]   the Hilton Aspire on that page
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.060]   because there just isn't an offer there.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.140]   However, my wife Amy does have her referral link set up.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.660]   So if you wanna use that to get the Hilton Aspire,
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.100]   she would appreciate it.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.540]   And you can find it at allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.780]   And then finally with IHG hotels,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.260]   they've got 45 hotels in Japan.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.320]   And I know it's kind of often,
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.980]   I think of IHG as having a bunch of holiday inns
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.800]   and that kind of stuff,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.900]   but there are a couple of really nice intercons
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.780]   in Tokyo, Osaka, and a few other cities,
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   including one called the Intercontinental Beppu,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.060]   which is a hot springs resort and looks really awesome.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.240]   And if you have an IHG Premier or Traveler card,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.500]   the Premier card by the way right now
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.120]   has 175,000 points signup bonus.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.740]   It's on my cards page also.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.220]   You get fourth night free,
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.020]   even better than fifth night free.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.100]   So definitely if you're gonna book a couple of stays
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.260]   for four nights or more in Japan
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.980]   or anywhere in the world actually,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.100]   it's probably worth having that IHG card
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.160]   'cause you'll get every fourth night you book
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.680]   at the same property free.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.120]   I do caveat that transferring points
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.460]   to a lot of these programs,
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.300]   whether it's from Chase or Built to IHG
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.700]   or Amex or Chase to Marriott,
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.380]   I will say make sure it's a good deal
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.700]   because oftentimes the value of those points,
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.260]   I gave you an example where you could get
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.780]   almost two cents from Marriott,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.820]   but that's really hard.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.580]   Oftentimes you might only be getting half a cent.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.080]   And I just think you're gonna get a lot better value
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.860]   transferring those points and using them with airlines.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.940]   The exception being Chase to Hyatt
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.180]   is often a pretty good deal.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.020]   So definitely worth considering there.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.980]   But I'm not saying it's not possible to find a good deal.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.900]   I just say do the math first to make sure
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.300]   that those points wouldn't be better spent on flights
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.580]   than they would on hotels.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.980]   Finally, if you don't have any hotel points,
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.980]   obviously you can do some searching online.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.500]   I talked in the London episode
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.300]   about some of my experiences booking with Airbnb.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.940]   I've never booked an Airbnb in Japan,
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.660]   but I will remind everyone that we do have a partnership
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.740]   that gets you at four and five star hotels,
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.140]   perks like upgrades, free breakfast, resort credits,
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.900]   early check-in, late checkout, and that kind of stuff.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.300]   So if you are trying to book a high-end property,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.100]   definitely shoot an email to upgrade@allthehacks.com
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.580]   and I'll see if we can help you out
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.040]   and get you all those perks.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.860]   They're very similar to the perks you get
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.380]   from booking through Amex at fine hotels and resorts
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.260]   or a lot of the hotel collections.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.540]   With your card companies and their portals,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.980]   except two things.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.560]   One, I think we have about 4,000 hotels
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.620]   that we can do this with,
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.940]   and most of them are limited to hundreds or maybe 1,000.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.140]   And then separately,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.020]   we tend to work directly with the hotels.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.860]   So you're actually getting a reservation from Hyatt,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.660]   not from Chase, which, you know,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.900]   I always prefer booking direct.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.020]   So I think that could be helpful.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.420]   So that's an option.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.660]   And then two other things outside of luxury,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.040]   outside of points on the hotel side
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.820]   that I thought about sharing.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.980]   One, not a great option, either of them, by the way,
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.520]   if you're traveling as a family or with kids,
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.860]   but I will say I've heard a handful of people
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.740]   who've done some solo traveling
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.420]   or even like early 20s traveling
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.060]   and stayed at hostels or capsule hotels
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.300]   or like little pod hotels in Japan.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.780]   And you'll notice Japan is a very clean place.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.700]   And so it's a very different experience.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.060]   And a lot of the reason these capsule hotels might exist
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.220]   is 'cause people are in Tokyo for business,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.180]   they stay out late and they just wanna get some sleep
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.580]   and a shower before the next day so they can go to work
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.540]   and they don't have to commute all the way home.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.980]   So they're very functional and very clean places.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.300]   So I would definitely check that out
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.660]   if that meets the kind of travel you're doing,
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.020]   you might be able to save.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.140]   And then when you're talking about taking those trips
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.060]   from Tokyo to Kyoto or Osaka,
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.260]   another option other than the train,
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.860]   which can be expensive,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.460]   if you're looking to do it on a budget,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.300]   is to take an overnight bus.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.620]   And the reason I say this is because
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.140]   you save having to stay one night in a hotel.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.500]   Now, maybe a hostel's cheaper,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   but some of these buses are really, really nice.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.020]   I'll link in the show notes to this company, Willer,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.620]   who has named the chairs on their bus.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.540]   The Reborn is what they're actually called.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.220]   Willer's Reborn Seating.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.260]   And it looks very nice.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.940]   It's like 155 degree pitch.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.900]   So you're almost lie flat
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.020]   with walls on the side of your little seat cubby.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.620]   So definitely a good option
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.620]   if you can sleep in an environment like that
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.420]   and wanna save some money on a hotel
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.700]   when you're traveling between cities in Japan.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.140]   That's hotels.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.460]   I think that covers all of the ways
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.180]   to use points and miles to get there, to stay there.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.020]   If you have any tips that I missed, let me know,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.940]   and I'll pass them on to others.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.620]   I love Japan so much.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.060]   I'm already thinking, how do we take our next trip there,
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.220]   which will be trip five for us.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.780]   And I'm just so excited.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.700]   So if you end up taking a trip,
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.740]   if any of this is helpful, let me know.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.020]   I'd love to share some wins
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.740]   and I'd love to hear how your experience is.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.860]   But I'm gonna leave it at that,
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.220]   and I'll see you next week.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.220]   (crickets chirping)
