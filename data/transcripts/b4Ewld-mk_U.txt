[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   because I was going to 52 places in 52 weeks, I didn't have time to prepare.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.800]   Right. I, I, I luckily had someone at the times who was helping me and she would
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.240]   send me like a really great, like one pager of like, here's what you need to
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.880]   know about currency and here's what you need to know about, you know, public
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.640]   transportation. And here's like the top 10 things to do when you Google the
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.440]   place, right? Like these are the big tourist hits or whatever.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   I would try to like knock out those 10 things in like an afternoon and be like,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.040]   okay, so I've done the brass tacks. I've seen that now, like, let me actually
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.480]   have an experience. You know, and I think that goes back to this idea of like
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.800]   travel being more serendipitous, more spontaneous, more connective than it is
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.040]   extractive. I think a lot of the times we think of travel as extractive where
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.920]   it's like, I need to go in there, get things that make me fulfilled and leave
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.720]   and that's and wash my hands of it and plan the next trip. And I think leaving
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   things open has always led to the best experiences.
