[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.860]   This is a 21 and over event.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.940]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.780]   meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.220]   Today, we pick up our Asset Protection Planning for Mere Mortals series.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.680]   Back to some technical financial planning in today's show.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.480]   This is part 11 of the series wherein we discuss wage exemption planning.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.620]   This episode will not be the last in this series, but this is the last of the
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.360]   exemptions that we need to cover.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.800]   The concept behind this Asset Protection Planning for Mere Mortals series is to
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.240]   give ordinary people who are engaged in fairly ordinary lifestyles some
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.080]   information on how you can set yourself up to be protected, to have your assets
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.540]   protected in case you face some kind of significant legal threat.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.620]   And so we're dealing with the very basics.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.640]   Basics number one is exemption planning.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.820]   Today, we round out exemption planning.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.860]   I think we'll talk a little bit about asset titling.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.060]   We'll talk a little bit about some basic business structures.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.320]   And I think I'll leave this series alone with those basics.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.860]   I'm not going to get into any advanced concepts, any trusts, any offshore
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.440]   planning, et cetera, in this particular series.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.760]   But today, I want to talk about wage exemption planning.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.400]   Now, wage exemption planning is one of those funny little ones because it's very
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.300]   different than some of the other things that we've talked about.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.580]   With all the other exemption planning ideas that we have discussed, we've
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.540]   talked about how do you protect an asset.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.020]   But today, we're talking about how do you protect your income against wage
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.980]   garnishment.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.460]   Well, why would your wages be garnished?
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.800]   Most of the reasons why your wages would be garnished are not related to some of
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.760]   the legal threats that we've largely focused on in this particular series.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.900]   It is the case that your wages could be garnished as a result of a judgment being
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.700]   entered against you in a court.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.140]   You are sued by somebody.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.180]   That person wins the lawsuit.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.620]   You submit to the debtors examination, to your judgment creditors, and you don't
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.420]   have any money.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.920]   And so they say, "Well, we've got this judgment against you.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.420]   You don't have any money.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.360]   You don't have any assets that we can take."
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.660]   And so they can, in some circumstances, go ahead and say, "Well, we're going to
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.860]   garnish your wages."
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.600]   And wage garnishment simply means that some of your paycheck is going to be sent
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.100]   directly to your creditors rather than being given to you.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.580]   The way the process actually works is you lose the lawsuit, the judgment is entered
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.620]   against you, the person, the attorney who wins the lawsuit against you will take a
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.820]   copy of the court order to the local sheriff, and then the local sheriff will
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.660]   bring that to your employer.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.360]   Your employer will then notify you that your wages are going to be garnished, and
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.500]   your employer will have the responsibility of withholding part of your wages, and
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.200]   they will send that money directly to your creditor.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.940]   So the idea is you'll be working, but somebody else will be receiving some or
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.180]   much of your paycheck.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.580]   Most of the time, the reasons that wages are garnished are more related to things
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.220]   like child support or back taxes or sometimes things like student loans,
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.180]   because the pathway to wage garnishment is fairly direct for child support, student
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.660]   loans, and back taxes.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.260]   The tax agencies, they don't have to sue you.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.860]   They don't have to go through the long process.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.820]   And so those are each unique risks that in some cases can be simply avoided,
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.960]   unlike the major legal risks that we've talked about throughout this series.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.100]   If you don't ever take out a student loan, you don't face the risk of your wages
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.300]   being garnished by a student loan company.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.700]   That's why I recommend not taking out student loans.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.980]   They're extremely dangerous.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.500]   There are much better ways to finance your educational expenses than student loans.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.820]   Similarly, if you don't owe child support or you're not divorced,
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.660]   you don't owe child support, then your wages aren't going to be garnished.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.420]   And then taxes, if you can keep up on your taxes,
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.100]   then you aren't going to have your wages garnished.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.420]   And wage garnishment seems to be more likely used many times
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.220]   by state tax agencies, not necessarily against the IRS.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.820]   Now, I don't know that to be a fact.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.180]   That's just my guess as I survey the information that
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.980]   comes through, comes past my eyeballs.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.980]   So that's different than the legal risks that we've talked about,
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.660]   you're being sued and then having that court judgment.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.780]   So for those other risks, we have to do some other planning.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.660]   For example, child support is very, very difficult.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.740]   Many, many wages are subject, are garnished because of child support
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.900]   obligations.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.700]   In fact, since the late '80s, all child support orders
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.020]   include an automatic wage withholding order.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.620]   And so once that's in place, it makes it very easy for your wages
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.700]   to be garnished.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.980]   And in fact, there are actually higher limits in many states
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.100]   as to the amount of your pay that can be garnished
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.660]   if you have child support obligations as compared to just simply owing
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.740]   some other type of creditor.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.300]   So it can be a real challenge.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.020]   It's a real burden.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.420]   The strategies that are effective for discharging your child support
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.380]   obligations almost all have to be done prior
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.580]   to the finalization of a divorce decree.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.180]   Because the government is deeply committed to making sure
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.220]   that child support gets paid, deeply, deeply committed.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.940]   I mean, there's all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.060]   First of all, at the end result, there's
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.380]   all kinds of shaming things.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.740]   Many states publish the names and photos of people
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.540]   who are behind on child support obligations
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.860]   to engage in public shaming operations.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.620]   Many states-- there are many people in prison for many people
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.700]   who simply haven't paid child support, and they're in prison
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.540]   because they're held in civil contempt of court.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.340]   And so most of your strategies for child support obligations
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.060]   have to occur before the divorce decree.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.940]   That's a subject for another day.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.900]   Never known if I want to do that show or not.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.460]   But it doesn't help.
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.340]   It doesn't help with wage garnishment.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.260]   Student loans are interesting, but they're fairly simple to get forward.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.500]   If you will just talk to them and you'll keep it going,
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   you can oftentimes get out of the student loan
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.020]   garnishment and taxing agencies.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.300]   You can deal with them.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.580]   But what do you do if you do face wage garnishment?
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.100]   First, there are wage exemptions that are in place.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.540]   And in fact, all states have some formula
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.460]   that discusses wage exemptions.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.300]   Now, the states vary in terms of how much of the wages
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.860]   that they protect.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.460]   The federal wage garnishment exemptions
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.700]   limit the ability of a judgment creditor in their garnishment
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.780]   to these numbers.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.180]   Either they can garnish the lesser of--
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.820]   they can garnish the lesser of either 25%
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:52.300]   of your disposable earnings or your weekly disposable earnings
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.580]   less 30 times the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 an hour.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.980]   So let's define the terms.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.780]   What are your disposable earnings?
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.020]   Well, your disposable earnings are your gross pay minus taxes
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.340]   and mandatory deductions.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.140]   Mandatory deductions is any deduction that your employer is legally
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.100]   required to withhold from your paycheck, things
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.580]   like Social Security and the federal, state, and local taxes.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.700]   The mandatory deductions does not include any kind of savings.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.620]   It doesn't include your insurance contributions or your 401(k)
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.180]   contributions or anything that's not required by law.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.300]   It's only those things that are required by law, mainly taxes
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.420]   and federal income taxes and employment taxes.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.340]   So to figure out the numbers, you can first
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.060]   start by calculating what 30 times the federal minimum wage is,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.780]   basically 30 hours of work at $7.25 per hour.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.140]   That number comes out to $217.50.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:02.860]   If you make less than $217.50 per week, then your wages
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.900]   can't be garnished under the federal guidelines
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.340]   because you just make too little.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.540]   So if you make a higher number-- so for example,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.980]   let's say that you make $500 per week--
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.300]   then either the garnisher can garnish the lesser of 25%
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   of that number, which would be $125 if we just
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.660]   go with the percentage, or $282.50, which is $500,
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:36.380]   the weekly wages, minus that 30 times the minimum wage, $217.50.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.140]   So in that case, the creditor would
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:45.540]   be limited to the total, which was 25% would be $125 per week.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.180]   That's how much that they could garnish.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.140]   Now, there are other limits and things
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.500]   that are imposed depending on it.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.420]   And you can look it up, the individual rules
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.660]   for your state.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.500]   Each state has their own individual limitations
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.700]   and rules.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.340]   So you need to look that up and understand
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.580]   what they are for your state.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.620]   But let's get right to the strategies for how do
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.820]   you cover your exempt wages.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.380]   Well, the first strategy that you have
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.820]   is simply to move to a state that protects wages.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.100]   So just like with every other exemption
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.620]   that we have discussed, each state treats wages differently.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.580]   And there, in this case, are a handful
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.740]   of states that either provide significant exemptions
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.020]   or they provide for no wage attachment whatsoever.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.380]   Let's deal with the ones that are--
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.380]   let's do them in alphabetical order.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.740]   In first place, we have Florida.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.420]   So like with many other things, Florida
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.700]   has an excellent ability to protect wages
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.420]   if you can file as the head of a household.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.380]   So if you can file as a head of household, a head of family,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.300]   then Florida will not allow wage garnishment,
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.060]   which is extremely helpful.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.940]   The way that you qualify as a head of household
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.660]   is by providing more than one half of the support
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.780]   of another person.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.260]   So it doesn't matter whether you are married, divorced, never
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.300]   married, widowed, anything, just living alone even.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.020]   If you provide more than one half of the support
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.140]   for another person, even if that person doesn't live with you,
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.860]   then you can qualify as a head of household, a head of family,
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.460]   which is very, very helpful.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.820]   Because with that, all of your wages
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.580]   can be protected from wage garnishment.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.260]   Now remember, way, way back in the series,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.420]   I said one of the basic strategies to always keep
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.340]   in mind is move to Florida.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.060]   And we've talked through again and again why.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.540]   Because of Florida's generous provisions
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.740]   for their homestead laws, Florida's generous provisions
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.100]   for protecting 401(k)s, IRAs, Roth IRAs, college savings
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.540]   accounts, et cetera.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.460]   And now in this case, we kind of round out
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.420]   the reason why one of the things you should keep in mind
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.140]   is, well, move to Florida.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.140]   Now the only place where Florida is weak
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.820]   when it comes to bankruptcy and creditor protection laws
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.340]   is with regard to personal property.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.140]   Florida does not have generous personal property exemptions.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.540]   Now in this case, thankfully, Florida is not alone.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.020]   There are three other states, at least, that I'm aware of,
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.340]   that don't allow wage attachment at all.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.060]   And Florida only works if you can
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.340]   file as head of household.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.620]   So if you are a single individual not providing
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.140]   support for at least 50% of the support for a dependent,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.260]   then the Florida strategy in this case for wage exemption
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.980]   doesn't work.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   But in your case, you should consider Pennsylvania, South
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.540]   Dakota, or-- sorry, South Carolina, not South Dakota.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.340]   Pennsylvania, South Carolina, or Texas.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.820]   Pennsylvania provides no wage attachment except for taxes
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.500]   and child support.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.700]   So that can be helpful.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.900]   South Carolina, in South Carolina,
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.020]   wage attachment is prohibited.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.180]   And in Texas, wages cannot be attached or garnished
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.980]   except for child support.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.900]   Again, that's why I tried to point out to you,
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.740]   child support is a very, very challenging proposition.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.780]   More than anything else that I'm aware of,
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.700]   it is just the states and the federal government
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.340]   are very, very serious about enforcing child support
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.700]   judgments.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.740]   So the idea is, if you move to one of those states,
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.900]   there is a strong chance, at least that I'm aware of,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.380]   there's a very strong chance that you can live in those
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.820]   states and that you can protect your income.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.700]   Now, the only thing that I'm aware of
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.180]   is I think that if you live in Texas,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.100]   there's one lawsuit somewhere.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.900]   If you live in Texas and yet your employer
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   pays you from another state location, then in that case,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.420]   you may still be subject to the claims of another state.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.260]   So just be careful about that, making sure
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.220]   that if you're going to live in Texas
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.300]   that you are actually getting your wages from Texas
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.060]   so that your creditor can't go to the state
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.140]   where your company is located and then file the wage
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.140]   garnishment there.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.220]   So make sure that you're protected there.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.820]   So it's best if you're working in Florida, Texas, South
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.820]   Carolina, et cetera, make sure you're
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.420]   working for a company in there.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.020]   But I want you to think about this.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.980]   If wage garnishment is causing you major, major problems,
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.100]   if you can simply move to a state that protects those
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.100]   wages, you may be able to rebuild your life
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.020]   and put your life back together, which
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.180]   is the whole goal of some of these ideas.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.300]   As I try to deal with in episode two of this series
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.340]   where we talked about the ethics and the morality of this,
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.580]   I want you to pay your debts, debts
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.860]   that you are morally obligated to pay,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.580]   I want you to pay those.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.660]   And debts that you are legally obligated to pay,
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.580]   whether you are morally responsible or not,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.580]   unless you are taking a moral stand by willfully not paying
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.260]   something that is legally imposed on you because
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.060]   the imposition of that debt is immoral, in general,
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.900]   you're going to need to pay the legal debts,
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.700]   because your life just becomes difficult if you don't pay
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.180]   them.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.300]   So you've got to pay the debts.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.820]   You owe them morally for the debts
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.580]   that you're morally responsible for.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.020]   And then legally, you generally need to clear them.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.700]   The problem is, how do you fight?
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.340]   How do you make it happen?
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.100]   And sometimes, if you're just simply
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.540]   having all your money sucked out,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.380]   your bank accounts are sucked dry,
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.180]   your income is sucked up, you can't rebuild.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.340]   And this is especially the case if you owe a lot of money.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.020]   Example, if you owe $5,000, and you're working,
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.500]   and your wages are being garnished to the tune of $200
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.220]   per month, well, I don't think it's worth it for you
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.180]   to move states over just a measly $200 a month wage
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.220]   garnishment.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.540]   Just let that sit there.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.260]   And in a couple of years, you'll have that debt paid off.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.140]   And once the debt is fully satisfied,
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.640]   the wage garnishment stops.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.700]   And if you're just working a job and making money,
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.620]   then it probably just simply makes
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.460]   your life easy to have it go directly from your paycheck
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.140]   to the creditor.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.660]   It helps you not to accidentally spend the money.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.780]   But that's very different than somebody who
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.060]   might owe a huge amount of money.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.500]   Let's say that I have $100,000 judgment that
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.940]   is entered against me.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.460]   Well, and let's say that I'm supporting a family,
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.460]   I've got financial responsibilities.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.760]   How am I going to pay off $100,000 judgment
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.000]   just in a short amount of time with wage garnishment?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.360]   It's not going to happen.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   And so in that situation, I'm going
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.160]   to need to be doing something dramatic to generate
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.360]   the $100,000 so that I can pay off the debt that I own.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.960]   Oh, and in those cases, if my wages are being consumed
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   by supporting my family, and then my wages need
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.880]   to be available for me to invest the money
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.440]   and go for some big win where I can generate $100,000 of profit,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.260]   it may be very, very burdensome for me
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.620]   to have that wage garnishment.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.540]   And in that case, moving to a state
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.740]   wherein my wages are protected could very well
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.620]   serve me and allow me to be protected
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.060]   so that I can invest the money into something that's
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.940]   going to grow.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.820]   And then once it grows, then I can go ahead and simply pay off
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.460]   the debt in a lump sum.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.340]   So having your wages protected can be extremely important.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.780]   That's the basic strategy here.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.740]   And that's why it is helpful.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.240]   If you think that if the wage garnishment is just
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.640]   a matter of fact, and it'll work out,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.800]   and you'll have enough wages that you can live on,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.880]   you'll have enough wages that you
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.960]   can handle the things that you need to handle,
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.280]   and then it'll clear off this creditor,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.400]   probably just let the wage garnishment sit there
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.000]   until you can clear out the creditor.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.840]   But if it's burdensome to you, then you
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.280]   need these strategies in your back pocket.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.800]   Now, if you don't want to move, or can't move,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.600]   or just have decided not to move,
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.040]   you should look into the specific head of household
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.820]   exemptions for your specific state.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.420]   Most states will have some kind of head of household exemption.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.740]   And sometimes, like I said, in Florida,
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.500]   it'll exempt 100% of your wages.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.980]   In some states, it'll protect some larger amount,
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.700]   but not 100%.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.180]   I know Missouri provides a 90% exemption,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.820]   which means that no more than 10% of your disposable income
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.200]   will be garnished.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.860]   And then some states, it's based upon a formula of an amount
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.660]   that is necessary for the care and support of your family.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.180]   Now, remember, you generally will need to file an exemption
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.700]   with the court.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   So when the garnishment is issued,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.940]   you'll need to contest it in court and claim an exemption.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.500]   And in general, you'll need to provide proof of your claims,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.340]   proof of your dependents.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.600]   You'll need to provide financial information
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.380]   about your expenses, et cetera, in order
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.020]   to get that document taken care of.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.340]   But you can protect that.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.180]   Now, in thinking, I want you to notice a couple of--
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.880]   as we move on to a couple of strategies,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.020]   I want you to notice the importance of that word "wages."
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.980]   Wages.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.260]   There could come a time that you're subject to a wage
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.300]   garnishment, and yet you face a situation where you've
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   got to protect your income.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.760]   Maybe you're making a moral stand.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.100]   You're choosing not to pay something that is immoral,
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.800]   but you still have to support your family
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.140]   and figure out how to keep on going.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.740]   So in that situation, remember that word "wages."
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.260]   In general, if a state-- in my understanding,
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.380]   if a state protects wages, it does not
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.580]   care how much those wages are.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.020]   So what that means is there are potentially
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.380]   strategies where you could adjust the way
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.500]   that your income is earned so that you maximize your wages,
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.700]   and then you keep your wages as a separate account
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.380]   from your other assets so that you can maintain that money.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.700]   Example would be this.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.420]   Let's say that I were facing a major scenario.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.740]   Well, I run a business.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.220]   And let's say that if I run a business,
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.120]   often I might want to, for the sake of tax efficiency,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.020]   keep my wages relatively low and keep
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.660]   my profits of my business higher because that's
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.540]   a more tax-efficient way.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.900]   But what if I'm now subject to a wage garnishment?
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.860]   And what I find is that my wages are protected
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.220]   from the claims of my creditors.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.780]   They're protected from garnishment.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.980]   But my profits are not because as soon
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.060]   as I deposit the profits from my business in a bank account,
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.820]   that creditor can take their judgment
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.280]   that they've taken out against me.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.820]   They can take it to my bank, and they
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.540]   can have that money distributed out from my bank account.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.340]   But if my wages are protected, if I
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.340]   have the ability to change my compensation structure
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.420]   and simply have a higher wage going to me,
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.620]   yes, I'll pay more taxes.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.820]   I'll pay more employment taxes, et cetera.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.420]   I'll pay higher income taxes because I'm not
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.580]   taking out dividends.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.020]   But I can protect those wages.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.780]   And just like with almost everything else,
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.140]   the key here would be to segregate assets.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.940]   So if I were facing a situation like this,
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.300]   and if I were facing a wage exemption fight,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.740]   I would have a separate bank account that
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.580]   had no interest on it, non-interest-bearing bank
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.260]   account.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.900]   And I would exclusively deposit my wages
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.020]   in that account and nothing else, not a dime else,
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.060]   because I'm depending on the segregated account
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.260]   to provide me with the practical protection.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.840]   Because my savings accounts are going
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.500]   to be wiped out by my creditor.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.020]   Anything else that I have that's not an exempt account
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.220]   is going to be wiped out.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.140]   But if I can protect wages, and I can put those wages in a bank
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.540]   account and keep them separate, keep them identified as wages
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.980]   and not have them commingled with anything else,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.380]   then I can protect that exemption.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.140]   So you can use that term "wages" to your benefit.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.300]   Another strategy to fight against a wage garnishment
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.580]   is simply this.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.580]   Don't earn wages.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.140]   Instead, generate income in some other way.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.460]   So make profits instead of wages.
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.420]   The wage garnishment structure really only
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.500]   works well as a collection tool for a creditor
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.700]   if you have a job and they can go to your employer
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.500]   and file that writ of garnishment with them.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   That's the only place that it works.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.820]   It doesn't work if you don't have an employer.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.900]   It doesn't work if you don't earn wages.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.100]   Let's say that somebody makes their living by buying
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.980]   and selling houses.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.980]   Well, it's possible that if they own a house,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.700]   that the creditor can try to impose on that house.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.860]   But there are other ways you could probably
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.740]   protect against that.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.400]   The point is, if you can generate profit
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.660]   from the sale of an investment or profit from your business
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.660]   activity, then you don't have wages.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.380]   Let's say that I go out, and my way of supporting myself
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.140]   and my family is by selling hot dogs.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.660]   And so I have a hot dog cart.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.380]   And I go down on the street and I sell hot dogs all day.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.740]   At the end of the day, I have profits.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.980]   I have money that I've generated from my customers.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.260]   There's no practical way for a creditor
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.280]   to take that profit that was generated
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.780]   by my selling hot dogs.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   Or maybe I run a pressure cleaning business,
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.260]   and I go and pressure clean people's houses.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.620]   People give me a check at the end of the day.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.780]   I take that check.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.840]   I ask them for cash and get cash instead of a check.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.740]   If they don't want to do that, I take that check
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.580]   at the end of the day.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.540]   I only accept checks on local bank accounts.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.100]   I go to the local bank.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.660]   I cash the check at the bank.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.820]   And now I have cash.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.880]   There's no way in that transaction for a creditor
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.060]   to actually physically get their hands on that money.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.300]   Now, they'll still have their judgment taken out against me.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.220]   But they're not going to be able to take my income.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.700]   So if you can't protect your wages using a wage exemption,
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.860]   then don't earn wages.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.860]   Stop earning wages.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.700]   Make profits instead.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.420]   And depending on how you structure it,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.020]   you may have to readjust your business activities.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.620]   For example, let's say that I were that real estate investor.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.900]   Let's say that now I would face a major risk
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.740]   if I were to purchase a house,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.460]   because now I might have the risk of my creditor
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.500]   foreclosing on that house
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.540]   and trying to take that actual house that I purchased.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.820]   That's not going to work.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.020]   So now I might try to make all my income
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.220]   based on assignment fees,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.740]   assigning contracts or something like that,
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.240]   until I can earn enough money
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.680]   from my real estate investment activities
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.620]   to generate enough profit
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.220]   that's not going to be subject to garnishment,
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.740]   generate enough profit that I can then take that profit
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.860]   and I can pay off the judgment.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.500]   So don't earn wages.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.640]   Make profits.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.100]   Remember also, when you are looking at things,
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.540]   that depending on how your income is coming in,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.260]   it may or may not be even accessible in the first place.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.580]   For example, debt is not income.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.500]   Indebtedness is not income.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.220]   And so if I need income, but I have an exempt asset
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.220]   that I can in debt, or I can take out a loan against,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.020]   then now I can generate,
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.860]   I can free up money from that asset
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.740]   without actually selling the asset
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.300]   and running the risk of having that money
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.820]   made subject to the claims of my creditors.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.800]   So if I own a house,
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.620]   and the house is protected by the Homestead Exemption,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.500]   if I take out a mortgage on the house,
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.660]   I can use that money for other things,
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.900]   but that's not income.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.660]   And as long as I'm very careful to make sure
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.540]   that I never put that money into a bank account
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.540]   where the creditor can go to the bank
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.260]   and try to take it in that way,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.820]   I can protect that money.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.800]   So consider that.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.820]   As we also continue,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.940]   remember that not all income is wages.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.580]   And in fact, some income is by its nature exempt.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.100]   There are forms of exempt income.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.020]   So you can sometimes exempt wages.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.100]   But in general, there are other forms of income
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.620]   that are just flat out statutorily exempt
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.580]   from the claims of creditors.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.540]   Social security income, very, very importantly.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.740]   If you're receiving social security income,
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.180]   be it disability or be it retirement income,
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.900]   that income stream cannot be attached
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.580]   by the claims of your creditors.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.620]   So this is one of the reasons why I'm teaching this stuff
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.340]   is because I've seen so many elderly people
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.780]   be abused by credit collectors
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.940]   when really they should tell the credit collector,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.580]   listen, I'm judgment-proof.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.980]   You can't get a dime from me.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.020]   All I have is social security income and a 401(k).
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.720]   You can't touch either of those things.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.900]   Take a hike.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.780]   So social security income is exempt
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.980]   from the claims of creditors.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.320]   Disability income, be it whether it come from social security,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.620]   whether it come from a private insurance policy,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.820]   like a disability income insurance policy,
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.580]   or if it's some other form of disability payment,
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.620]   is generally exempt from the claims of creditors.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.980]   Most retirement income streams are exempt
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.120]   from the claims of creditors
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.260]   because they flow from an asset that is often protected.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.520]   So if you're receiving a retirement distribution
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.420]   from a 401(k) payout,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.700]   well, the 401(k) is exempt from the claims of creditors,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.440]   so your income from that is also exempt.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.060]   If you're receiving a retirement income
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.420]   from a defined benefit plan,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.620]   let's say you are a municipal employee,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.900]   a firefighter of some kind,
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.260]   and you're receiving a paycheck every month
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.500]   from your pension,
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.820]   because the pension is protected, it's an exempt asset,
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.780]   the pension payment is also an exempt asset.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.400]   Now, I would be very careful, again,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.060]   to maintain the segregated account,
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.860]   and I would not commingle it.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.220]   So if I were subject to some kind of,
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   if I were subject to some kind of judgment,
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.320]   and I had a pension income coming in,
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.180]   I would have a separate account set up for that.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.820]   I would exclusively put the pension income in it,
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.140]   nothing else, not even any interest,
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.920]   I'd make it a non-interest bearing account,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.480]   and then not make any payments out of the account,
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.880]   just simply make a transfer,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   write one check from that account
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.680]   over to my other checking account from time to time
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.020]   for my actual bill paying, but segregate the asset.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.000]   Similarly, if you are receiving child support payments,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.960]   child support payments are an exempt income source,
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.520]   as is alimony.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.360]   So if you are on the receiving end
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.660]   of child support payments or alimony income,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.560]   those payments are not available for creditors,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.000]   they are exempt.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.880]   So you should additionally take the step
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.020]   of making sure that that is segregated to protect yourself,
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.040]   and to make sure that your other assets are protected.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.400]   So those are solutions so far.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.280]   Now, what else can you do?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.800]   Well, you can simply try to hide.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.520]   You can try to protect and do your work in secret.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.960]   Now, this is much easier done with business
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.200]   than it is with jobs.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.600]   The problem with jobs is that there are extensive
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.360]   registry systems that track people.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.960]   The most onerous of these is the systems
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.500]   that work for people, that track parents
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.120]   who owe child support.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   So when there are large national and state-level databases
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.920]   that track parents who own child support,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.340]   and there's massive amounts of information sharing
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.120]   between all the states and the federal government,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.640]   the only place that you could really go
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.280]   would be to go abroad, which is why,
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.220]   if you owe more than $2,500 of child support,
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.480]   then the Department of State will revoke your passport.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.440]   And so you won't even be able to leave the state
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.000]   and the country in that situation,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.440]   unless you can arrange to surreptitiously cross the border,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.480]   unless you have a second passport established
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.720]   with another nation.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.800]   So, but if you're in the United States,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.080]   anytime you get a job, your new employer
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   is required to report all new hires
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.440]   to their state's child support enforcement agency.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.760]   And then that agency forwards the information
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.960]   to the National Directory of New Hires,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.400]   and then that National Directory of New Hires
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.300]   works to match up any names and social security numbers
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.640]   of anybody who owes child support.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.280]   And then they go ahead and bring over the garnishment.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.480]   That's why everything is tracked
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.760]   by your social security number.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.960]   When you have a child,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.400]   your child is automatically associated,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.000]   their social security number is associated
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.600]   with your social security numbers, with your spouse.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.320]   That's why everything is tracked on you
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.040]   with your social security number.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.400]   That's a major problem.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.780]   Now, would it be possible for you to get a job
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.240]   that does not go in that system?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.080]   Of course.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.480]   There are tons and tons of people
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.200]   who get jobs all day long
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.720]   where they're not with large employers
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.460]   who are following all of the database rules.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.920]   The key is, if you get one of these jobs,
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.320]   millions of people every day, they take jobs,
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   and they stick out their hand,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.680]   they shake a hand with their employer,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.600]   employer says show up at eight, they show up at eight,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.000]   the end of the week, they get a check.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.840]   And no one else knows about it except the two of them.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.120]   But when you're getting a job,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.080]   the key is you better make sure that you cover your track
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.980]   so that even that job does not get exposed
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.560]   with the information.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.680]   Even if you can successfully avoid the database systems,
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.120]   you will have to be on your guard
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.720]   to make sure that your banking transactions,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.320]   your bank records, et cetera,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.300]   don't demonstrate the fact that you have gotten this job,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.280]   lest your creditors now be able to come,
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.600]   identify your employer, and find that.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.120]   And in many cases, it may even come down
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.440]   to learning how to successfully conceal your activities
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.700]   from a private investigator.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.680]   Now, we get into some pretty tough stuff in that situation.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.420]   If you are facing a creditor that is determined enough
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.840]   to hire a private investigator
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.200]   who will sit outside your house for day after day,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.320]   figure out where you go,
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.400]   you can do some surveillance detection routes
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.720]   and cover your tracks and figure out how to drop a tail,
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.040]   check your car for GPS locator beacons
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.400]   and figure out how to make sure
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.120]   that you're not in the license plate databases
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:34.960]   and registries.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.600]   I mean, there are ways that could be done.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.900]   It's not like it's impossible,
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.700]   but certainly that would require a higher level
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.120]   of dedication than many people would possess.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.700]   At the very least, go back and listen to episode 503
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.020]   of this podcast called "Tools and Principles
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.840]   to Help You Fight Nasty with Your Creditors and Win,"
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.340]   so that you can at least cover your financial tracks.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.880]   Make sure that you never deposit employer checks
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.020]   into a bank account.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.440]   Make sure that you minimize your banking footprint
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.680]   as much as possible.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.380]   Deal in cash, cash your checks at the bank
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.840]   that they're drawn on, et cetera,
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.360]   so that you can minimize any kind of trail
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.020]   that is easily exploited by a creditor.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.740]   That will help you to be able to hang on to your money
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.940]   until you can figure out how to get it
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.820]   so that we can, so they can pay it back.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.300]   So jobs are difficult, but not entirely insurmountable.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.140]   Just by simply working in secret.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.920]   Don't update your LinkedIn database and LinkedIn profile
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.020]   and tell everyone where you just got a new job
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.360]   if you don't want your creditor filing the writ of garnishment
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.260]   with that new employer.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.660]   Your better solution here, of course, would be business.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.300]   So running some kind of business.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.140]   And what I would recommend is in general,
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.180]   probably the simplest thing to do is to have a job,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.980]   and with that job, you go ahead and have the garnishment,
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.700]   deal with that, but then run a weekend business,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.440]   run a side hustle, run other businesses
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.280]   that will allow you to generate the income
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.900]   that you need to live on,
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.540]   and that will allow you to generate the income
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.380]   that you need to pay off the debt.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.840]   That's going to be a much more productive use of your time.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.960]   If you maintain a job, so let's say that you can keep a job
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.640]   that's several days a week, the garnishment is there,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.560]   your creditor's probably gonna leave you alone
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.000]   if they have a wage garnishment, they're receiving payments,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.460]   they're not gonna be chasing you all the time.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.600]   But then spend your weekend, I don't know,
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.120]   build birdhouses and sell 'em at the green market,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.640]   or whatever business things that you've come up with,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.320]   spend your weekends and your off time doing that.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.680]   Get money directly from your customers,
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.200]   and then that money from your customers
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.640]   can be used to invest, that money from your customers,
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.740]   you can stack it up until you can afford
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.940]   to pay off the judgment,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.320]   or if you're not paying off the judgment,
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.720]   just keep it to yourself and keep it
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.120]   out of the banking system.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.000]   And there's a decent chance that as long as
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.300]   your wage garnishment is tricking along
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.640]   and they're getting payments, maybe you can just simply
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.060]   avoid having to submit to another debtors examination,
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.480]   and then you don't have to, you know,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.640]   then once everything's paid off,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.480]   you're good to go and restart.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.280]   So business is going to be your friend
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.040]   when it comes to generating income,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.840]   where your creditor's fingers are not literally
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.040]   there taking money out of your wages.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.160]   And then finally, I would just say, remember this,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.640]   you can always stop wage garnishment with bankruptcy.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.480]   So bankruptcy really works well to stop garnishments,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.360]   and it may work well to just terminate even the claim,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.840]   the judgment that's against you.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.260]   And that's why, as I've emphasized again and again
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:34.260]   through this series, you must think bankruptcy protection
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.320]   as you're thinking asset protection all along the way.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.880]   You've got to keep those two things together.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.940]   Now, I'm not competent enough to give advice
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.420]   as to any specific thing here,
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.460]   as far as if you can vacate your judgment
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.540]   that's taken out against you with a bankruptcy filing.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.660]   But I do know that you can stop
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.960]   the wage garnishment with bankruptcy.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.320]   It'll stop it, you'll give a stay,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.140]   just like with everything else with bankruptcy,
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.860]   you will have a stay on all collections,
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.120]   on all debt collections when you file for bankruptcy.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.040]   And if you have positioned yourself and your assets
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.860]   effectively so that you focused on assets
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.580]   that are exempt in bankruptcy court,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.280]   then there's a very decent chance
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.400]   that you may be able to use bankruptcy itself
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.100]   to terminate the judgment
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.180]   and still emerge the other side to rebuild.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.420]   And I think that's ultimately,
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.540]   you always have to keep that in mind.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.540]   You should recognize that in the worst case scenario,
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.060]   you could be forced into an involuntary bankruptcy,
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.460]   plan accordingly, and you should always think
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.660]   in terms of a worst case scenario,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.820]   how would I get out?
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.640]   Bankruptcy.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.040]   Bankruptcy court is your friend.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.180]   Understand the rules of bankruptcy.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.100]   Always imagine what would happen
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.660]   if you were forced to declare bankruptcy.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.900]   Position and adjust your affairs
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.120]   so that you maximize that protection.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.020]   And you'll have then the best case,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.020]   the best protection ultimately against most threats,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.100]   most creditor threats,
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.180]   and even against something as difficult as wage garnishment.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.480]   With these strategies, you should have enough information
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.660]   to protect your wages
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.740]   if you are subject to wage garnishment.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.780]   I would ask you just,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.300]   this was probably not you.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.940]   The average listener of Radical Personal Finance
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.100]   is not concerned about wage garnishment.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.800]   It is obviously a threat, but it's just not,
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.640]   I've never received a single email question
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.120]   from a listener on wage garnishment.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.200]   My biggest thing I want you to do
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.880]   is I want you to just think about this,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.940]   and if you know somebody whose wages are being garnished,
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.020]   try to help them with some of the information.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.080]   And again, in general,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.000]   probably the best thing to do is just leave it alone
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.760]   and have their debts paid off
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.600]   and make a little income on the side
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.760]   to make up the difference and leave it alone.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.000]   But if you need this information, you need it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.700]   And so remember, you can maximize
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.780]   your head of household exemptions.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.300]   You can move to a state that protects your wages.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.740]   Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.420]   here are your friends.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.460]   Make sure that you don't earn wages.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.660]   So then maximize your wages or don't earn wages.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.420]   Make profits instead.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.020]   Focus on making sure that you protect
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.940]   any exempt income that you have.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.940]   Work privately, engage in private work for others,
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.600]   and/or engage in private business
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.260]   so that you can accumulate the assets to pay off the debt
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.540]   or to simply accumulate the assets
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.780]   if you're not willing to pay the debt,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.680]   and then stop wage garnishment with a bankruptcy filing.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.780]   This will conclude the exemptions,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.440]   but if you listen to this series,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.500]   if you've maximized this, if you've understood,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.260]   if you've researched your state laws,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.900]   you have the information to protect your assets.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.200]   This is incredibly valuable, and you've got to use it.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.020]   I want to emphasize how important this is in the modern age.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.860]   You can use the laws to protect what you own,
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.140]   and you can do so legally and ethically and morally,
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.300]   and that's incredible.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.160]   There are vast amounts of protection available for you
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.300]   if you will maximize that.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.920]   So don't get caught 10 years from now
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.500]   just listening to everything that I've discussed
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.460]   in this show.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.940]   If you listen to it and don't do anything, you're sunk.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.680]   10 years from now.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.200]   But if you will listen and simply adjust your affairs
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.240]   so that you maximize these exemptions that we've discussed
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.360]   in a way that makes sense, 10 years from now,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.920]   if you ever need this stuff,
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.960]   you will have put it into place.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.100]   You cannot do this kind of planning last minute.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.420]   There are a handful of techniques.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.720]   I discussed briefly in the annuity show.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.960]   If you want one of the few that I've ever been able
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.360]   to come across and research and find out,
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.720]   there are a handful of techniques available to you
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.920]   if you have never done any planning whatsoever
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.960]   and you're hit with a big bill.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.280]   You can leave.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.920]   You can always leave the country that you're in.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.780]   You can fly to the other side of the world,
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.440]   and unless you're a very high-profile criminal,
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.400]   in which case criminality makes basically
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.000]   all the stuff go out the window.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.920]   Unless you're a very high-profile criminal,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.480]   you can be fine just by leaving the country.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.680]   But you may not leave with any money
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.760]   if you didn't pre-position assets abroad,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.960]   which you should take my
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.560]   How to Survive and Thrive During Economic Crisis course
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.600]   for the discussion on that.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.280]   But if you were to simply position yourself
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.440]   and use these exempt assets to your benefit,
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.960]   you can be well-protected
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.340]   from the vast majority of conceivable risks.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:40.080]   A good financial defense plan is built in layers.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.680]   So you have layer upon layer after layer.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.120]   And think of it like watertight compartments.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.040]   If this watertight compartment fails on a ship,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.160]   okay, we've got others.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.480]   We've got layers.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.880]   And that's the basis of good asset protection planning.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.160]   Even, I wasn't sure to go into it.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.040]   All right, this show's called
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.880]   Radical Personal Finance for a reason.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.440]   Let me give you just one last strategy
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.340]   to deal with wage garnishment and wage exemptions.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.120]   Just recognize the fact that no one can force you to work.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.000]   Now, the only thing that doesn't work,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.140]   where this doesn't work,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.260]   is if you are dealing with child support obligations.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.200]   And if you didn't figure out how to do good planning
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.920]   before the divorce decree,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.040]   and you're dealing with child support obligations,
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.920]   a judge will throw you in prison
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.000]   if you just prove yourself to be completely obstinate.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.080]   And you will sit in prison
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:30.240]   as thousands and thousands of primarily men are today.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.320]   So this is dangerous with child support obligations.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.840]   But for many other judgments and things,
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.200]   recognize this, no one can force you to work.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   And I think you should have to work.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.200]   I think if a man doesn't work,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.160]   I don't think he should eat.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.200]   So I think you should work.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.860]   But no one can force you to work.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.000]   While ago, I thought about doing a whole series of shows
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.440]   on how to live on welfare, and live well on welfare.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.480]   And I went and started researching all of the states
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.080]   and all the welfare programs.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.680]   I don't think I'm ever gonna do the show,
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.080]   'cause it's just so hard for me, ethically, to do that.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.780]   But I'll tell you what,
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.920]   you're probably a pretty decently smart person.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.240]   And if you ever had your back up against the wall,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.000]   I would bet that you could probably take
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.920]   the same stick-to-itiveness that you've demonstrated
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.320]   in listening now to 41 minutes of this podcast,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.380]   and probably listening to about 10 hours
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.000]   of other podcasts that I've done,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.260]   and I would bet that you could probably figure out
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.040]   how to live extremely well,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.640]   doing nothing but suckling at the government tit.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.720]   But that's about the only thing that you could do.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.520]   If that was what you focused on, I bet you could do it.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.400]   You're as smart as I am, you could probably do it.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.000]   And so, one of the reasons why all this stuff flows together,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.260]   why should you be skillful in order to live
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.120]   on low amounts of income, if you ever wanted to,
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.560]   if you ever had to?
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.760]   Why should you be skillful about that?
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.940]   Well, you might need it someday.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:06.040]   I could live like a king on 500 to $1,000 a month,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   especially if I were using all of the welfare programs
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.640]   that are available.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:20.680]   I would follow every single rule and live extremely well.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.660]   And you could too.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.000]   Now, you say, "Well, where am I gonna live?"
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.240]   Well, just recognize the sheer vast number
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.880]   of things that are available.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.500]   I mean, let's say that I'm a homeless person.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.380]   I would be spending my days,
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.000]   one of the things I've always wanted to do,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.400]   I've always wanted to take a couple of months
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.320]   and go to Washington, D.C. and do nothing
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.640]   but go to all the museums.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.400]   I have never been able to spend enough time there
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.680]   to go to all the museums that I've wanted to.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.380]   I would be a professional museum-goer.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.840]   I would be a professional reader.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.760]   I have thousands of pages of reading
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.840]   that I would love to do that I can't do.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.240]   The libraries are filled with this.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.280]   Whenever I go to the library, I always talk to this bunch
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.440]   of homeless guys that use the library as their place.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.080]   I got free internet connection in the library.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.000]   The libraries aren't allowed to discriminate against me
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   no matter how smelly I am.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.160]   You take it and run with it.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.600]   But the point is this, you never have to earn wages.
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.740]   You can eat for free, you can sleep for free,
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.540]   you can be entertained for free.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.180]   If you can have just a few hundred dollars here and there,
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.000]   which is from your 401k or whatever,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   you can do extremely well.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.320]   Most welfare programs are not means-tested.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.800]   There's no requirement for you to fill out a questionnaire
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.760]   of what assets you have.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.480]   There's generally only a requirement
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.640]   for you to fill out what income you have.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.520]   And I would imagine that you could figure out a way
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.640]   to do a few things here and there and earn enough.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.240]   And that's basically your ultimate backstop,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.720]   your ultimate fallback defense.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.220]   If exemptions didn't work, if bankruptcy didn't work,
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.260]   well, you might not work either.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.840]   Now, I don't like that line of argumentation
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.280]   because I believe that you must work.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.480]   I believe that work is a moral duty
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.680]   that we face to support ourselves.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.800]   But I think that you can satisfy that moral duty to work
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.080]   without having to earn wages.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.600]   I don't think you have to be paid for your work.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.280]   You can give all your work away.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.720]   And you can be paid with meals in the houses of people,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.200]   and you can be paid with a bed.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.280]   And that stuff can't be foreclosed on.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.800]   That stuff can't be garnished.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.440]   And what I consider to be incredibly amazing
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.840]   about the modern era is I think that even if you were
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.920]   in that kind of situation, it doesn't mean
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.980]   that you wouldn't even be able to exercise influence.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.240]   You know, I've got a long list of things
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.000]   I've always wanted to spend my time advocating for
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.840]   and whatnot.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:49.160]   It's just not feasible for me, given my responsibilities,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.920]   to spend all my time being a political activist
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.760]   or something like that.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.520]   Generally, guys like me don't make great political activists
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.000]   because we have responsibilities.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.720]   Political activists tend to be people
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.800]   with fewer responsibilities.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.240]   But the amazing thing about it is,
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.880]   if you had your back up against the wall,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.440]   and all of a sudden you couldn't work for wages,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.080]   you could figure out a way to live well,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.240]   work for your support, you know, work for food and shelter.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.320]   And with the incredible ability and the cheapness
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.760]   that we have to access to publishing platforms,
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.480]   you could still get your message out.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.380]   You could still do your activist work.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.320]   You could have somebody give you a free computer,
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.800]   somebody donates their Wi-Fi password to you,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.880]   you could still be incredibly productive
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.640]   even in something like that.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.440]   We live in an amazing time.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.640]   I guess that's the point.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.000]   We live in an amazing time.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   And so let's use it, and let's be diligent to make sure
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.280]   that you never have to wind up in that worst case scenario.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.540]   But I think it's really valuable
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.460]   to test some of those things.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.460]   Last year, my family and I spent about six months
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.900]   traveling around the United States in an RV.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.460]   We had a number of goals.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.020]   One of my personal goals was I wanted to do that trip
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.860]   on the cheap.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.600]   I've not talked as much about that trip
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.920]   as I probably should have.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.420]   But one of the things that I wanted to test
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.100]   is I always wanted to test full-time RV living.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.660]   And I wanted to prove that it could be done on the cheap.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:24.580]   Now, I don't know that, we weren't uncomfortable,
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.220]   but if I were doing it over again,
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.540]   I would spend more money than I did.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.180]   But I wanted to prove that you don't have to have
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.220]   a lot of money to go travel the country.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.980]   You don't have to have a lot of money to buy a great RV.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.260]   You don't have to have a lot of money.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.500]   You don't need millions of dollars.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500]   And part of it is just always,
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.980]   well, if I were ever stripped of everything,
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.180]   I went bankrupt, well, at least I could do that.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.360]   And I know that I could be extremely happy,
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.940]   satisfied, and contented doing that.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.660]   I know I could provide a warm, safe, loving environment
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.540]   for my children and support them.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.660]   Even if I had no house, had no place to lay my head,
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.780]   I could do the RV thing, and you could too.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.820]   And there are dozens more strategies than that.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.840]   So just always remember that.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.740]   If you've got your back up against the wall,
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.980]   you're dealing with some kind of wage garnishment,
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.380]   you're dealing with something where
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.580]   just everything's stripped away from you,
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:22.580]   if you simplify your desires, and you can do well.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.980]   And if you just embrace a different lifestyle,
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.620]   if you've got an internet connection,
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.100]   you've got access to something that the kings of the world
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.400]   did not have 50 years ago.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.540]   Never had as much unlimited options for entertainment,
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.580]   and influence, and education as anything else.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.900]   So think about that.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.740]   And if you're wealthy, like I am,
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.140]   where you don't think that that's ever realistic,
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.740]   at least from time to time, put yourself in situations
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:53.740]   where you're not, don't be a slave to comfort.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.300]   Toughen up, and then that way,
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.020]   figure out how you would live well,
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.420]   if you're in that situation.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.380]   That is it for my wage exemption show,
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.260]   and that is it for the exemptions in this particular series.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.540]   I would, as I close here, as I want to encourage you
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.300]   to go by my store at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store,
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.380]   I just take a moment and talk with you
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.620]   about my how to survive and thrive
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.620]   during the coming economic crisis course.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.940]   One of the most incredible benefits that you could do,
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.180]   and that course is very much focused
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:34.120]   on how to survive and thrive during a crisis,
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.020]   but I cover it from multiple ways,
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.380]   and I do a couple things pretty extensively.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.140]   Number one, I talk a lot about how to protect yourself,
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.820]   how to set yourself up so that you can be protected
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.300]   in an economic crisis if the economy fails
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.700]   and you didn't leave.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.540]   But then the second thing I talk a lot about
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.540]   is how to leave and how to run away,
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   with a special focus on how to run away internationally,
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.820]   how to leave a problem, because I'm convinced
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.500]   one of the more effective ways
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.420]   to deal with a massive crisis,
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.500]   unlikely, it's the least likely of the scenarios,
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.820]   but unlike a massive national-level crisis,
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.180]   is simply go from where things are bad
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.060]   and go to where they're good.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.260]   You see this happening all over the world right now,
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.740]   thousands and thousands and thousands of people,
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.740]   refugees fleeing from Syria,
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.700]   thousands of refugees fleeing from Venezuela,
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.020]   thousands of refugees fleeing from Nicaragua.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.180]   Anytime that there's a major problem in a place,
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.700]   you see that people find life is untenable here.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.220]   But if they can just get from where things
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.540]   are simply unlivable to a functional place,
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.140]   they can figure it out again,
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.540]   even if people, if they have nothing.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.260]   Last couple of days, I've been watching a friend of mine
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.500]   who's been doing some work in Venezuela,
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.460]   and I've seen some videos,
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.860]   I mean, you don't see this stuff on the news.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.620]   If you work hard, you can find some of it online,
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.080]   but just personal, my personal connections,
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.000]   looking at videos of people who have nothing,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.860]   and it was just one video of a family,
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.780]   five children sleeping on the ground,
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.500]   on nothing more than a sheet laid out on the ground
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.460]   and a blanket over the seven of them,
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.520]   mom, dad, and five kids, and that's it, they got nothing.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.740]   And yet it was so bad for them in Venezuela
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:34.340]   that they left, they had to leave having nothing.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.020]   And just as a father, it breaks your heart
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.180]   to just imagine the desperation of that mom and dad
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.420]   of how things are so bad that they're reduced
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.180]   to a sheet spread out on the ground,
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.140]   no pillows, no comfort, no thermo rest, no aerobed,
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.900]   a sheet spread on the dirt,
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.240]   and a family of seven curled up together with a blanket.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.400]   It's brutal.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.540]   Now just imagine how bad life is
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.540]   for when you're gonna run when you've got that,
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.260]   crossing a border illegally,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.720]   taking refuge in another place.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.700]   Forgive me, it was just a big deal for me
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.460]   to have the personal contact and have that information,
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.460]   but just imagine how bad that is.
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.380]   Now, back to where we all live, most of us,
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:29.260]   getting across an international border, if you can do it,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.700]   can solve a lot of problems,
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.580]   and you can even solve problems in things like this.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.340]   So if you've got that backup plan,
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.460]   if all your money, if all your assets are frozen
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.340]   because you've become, you're identified with the terrorists
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.260]   or you're identified with the hate group or whatever,
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.940]   and now all your stuff is frozen,
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.340]   and you're under, sometimes you gotta leave.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.940]   And so that's a big component of it.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.660]   Now, those are radical things.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.220]   The course is good, but it's not just focused
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.540]   on tin hat stuff, tin foil hat stuff.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.860]   But come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.

[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.340]   has said anything negative about it.
