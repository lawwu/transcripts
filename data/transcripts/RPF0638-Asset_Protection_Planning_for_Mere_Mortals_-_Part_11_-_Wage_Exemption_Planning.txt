[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   As I try to deal with in episode two of this series where we talked about the ethics and the morality of this, I want you to pay your debts.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.900]   Debts that you are morally obligated to pay, I want you to pay those.

[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   You are taking a moral stand by willfully not paying something that is legally imposed on you because the imposition of that debt is immoral.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   In general, you're going to need to pay the legal debt because your life just becomes difficult if you don't pay them.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   So you've got to pay the debt.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   You owe them morally for the debts that you're morally responsible for and then legally you generally need to clear them. The problem is how do you fight? How do you make it happen? And sometimes if you're just simply having all your money sucked out and your bank account is a little bit of money and you're just going to pay for the other person.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:22.640]  , you're just going to pay the other person.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   So you're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   You're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   You're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   And once the debt is fully paid, you're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   You're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   Once the debt is fully paid, you're going to have to pay the debt.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   And once the debt is fully paid, you're going to have to pay the debt.

[00:15:52.660 --> 00:16:16.780]   and if you're just working a job and making money, then it probably just simply makes your life easy to have it go directly from your paycheck to the creditor.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.680]   It helps you not just accidentally spend the money.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   But that's very different than somebody who might owe a huge amount of money.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Let's say that I have a $100,000 judgment that is entered against me. Well, and let's say that I'm supporting a family. I've got financial responsibilities. How am I going to do this?
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Well, and let's say that I'm supporting a family. I've got financial responsibilities. How am I going to do this?
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Well, and let's say that I'm supporting a family. I've got financial responsibilities. How am I'm going to do this?
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   I'm going to pay off a $100,000 judgment just in a short amount of time with wage garnishment.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   It's not going to happen.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   And so in that situation, I'm going to need to be doing something dramatic to generate the $100,000 so that I can pay off the debt that I own.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   Oh, and in those cases, if my wages are being consumed by supporting my family, and then my wages need to be available for me to invest the money and go for some big win where I can generate $100,000 of profit, it may be very, very burdensome
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   and I'm going to need to be doing something dramatic to generate the $100,000 so that I can pay off the debt that I own.
