[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   One of the more interesting and kind of wacky things about OpenAI is that their mission is explicitly to create AGI, which most people would associate with some sort of sci-fi dystopian outcome.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:20.260]   And I think this has raised the fear factor around AI because they're explicitly trying to create the sentience that's going to replace humanity.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.380]   Deep down, when these guys say they're going to create AGI, what do you think they really mean in their heart of hearts?
[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.500]   Oh, they mean the Terminator. Yeah, they mean the sentient god.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.600]   You guys are propagating some bad sh*t. You guys shouldn't be saying this stuff.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   I think that's what they think. And Elon has said it.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.220]   Remember what Larry Page said to Elon? Don't be speciest.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.520]   I think there's a meaningful number of people in the tech community who deliberately want to give rise to the super intelligence.
