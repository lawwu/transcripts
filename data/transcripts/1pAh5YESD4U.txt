[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   There's one break that you reference in the book that I thought was super interesting and it's a worry break.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.560]   This one surprised me as well. I ran into a leader who had a sand timer on his desk.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.000]   He had a reputation for was being very very calm even though he worked inside a very cutthroat culture.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.160]   People loved working for him and he had exceptional results.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.960]   Was he naturally like this or were there some hacks, some things that he put into practice?
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.120]   And he said that what he would do is every time there was a worrying thought and it wouldn't go away,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   what he would do is he would go into his office and he would shut the door and he would take this five minute timer
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.180]   and he would flip it over and for five minutes he would focus on nothing but that one worry.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.520]   It sounds like a recipe for anxiety, but as I dug deeper into it
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.120]   what I realized is that there's a lot of science behind this practice.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.620]   When we have a worrying thought inside our head, we'll tend to try to push it out or compartmentalize it and to basically say,
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.600]   "Hey, I don't have time for you right now. I'm focusing on this other thing."
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.440]   When we push things out, what they tend to do
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.760]   is they tend to grow louder.
