[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Hello again and thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.840]   Whether you're commuting to work or at the gym or running errands or doing chores, wherever
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.640]   you are, we are certainly glad to have you along.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.560]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and John Piper joins me over the phone for today's question.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560]   It's an important one.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.560]   What are we to make of the baptism of the Holy Spirit?
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.080]   The phrase seems to mean very different things in the Bible and it certainly means very different
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.080]   things to different denominations and church practices.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.680]   Here's today's question sent in to us anonymously from Berlin, Germany.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.760]   Hello Pastor John and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.080]   I've struggled to understand and embrace the baptism of the Holy Spirit, especially manifested
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.000]   as someone laughing and rolling around on the floor or even passing out for 30 minutes
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   or longer.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.760]   I've seen churches do this and put a lot of focus on these experiences, which make me
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   quite uncomfortable.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.840]   Can you explain what the Bible means by the baptism of the Spirit as it relates to both
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.880]   number one, our initial salvation experience, and then number two, in explaining whether
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.440]   or not we are to expect or seek after subsequent baptisms of the Spirit later in the Christian
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   life?
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   Pentecostalism is usually defined as a movement in Christianity that thinks of the baptism
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.200]   of the Holy Spirit as a second experience, usually after conversion, marked by speaking
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.360]   in tongues.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.480]   That's the stereotype anyway of what Pentecostalism means.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.600]   That really is an oversimplification.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.000]   I just finished a book by Alan Heaton Anderson, To the Ends of the Earth, a History of Pentecostalism,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.640]   2013, Oxford University Press, and he shows that there are far more diverse understandings
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.480]   of the Holy Spirit in his work among global Pentecostalism than we thought.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:09.520]   What is common among many branches of Pentecostalism is not a singular view of baptism in the Spirit,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.400]   but rather a strong emphasis on the experiential nature of the Spirit's presence in the life
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.880]   of the believer.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.640]   And I think that is precisely why this emphasis on the experiential nature of the Spirit,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.960]   that's why the movement has been so globally dynamic and effective, because people everywhere
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:44.100]   are hungry for experiential reality, not just doctrinal facts or historical facts which
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.880]   are affirmed with the mind.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.380]   That's the stereotypical way of thinking about Western Christianity.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.600]   We have a list of doctrines, we have a list of behaviors, we believe the doctrines, we
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.720]   do the behaviors, and we infer that we belong to God and something supernatural is happening
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.560]   and nobody experiences anything.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.280]   That's why Pentecostalism is succeeding the way it does, because they're right on this.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.840]   Their right to have the Holy Spirit is to have a reality that one experiences.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.720]   So it's important that we clarify the meaning of biblical terms like "baptism in" or "with"
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   the Holy Spirit, because it is a biblical term and it's part of Christian experience.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:44.680]   So what I'm going to suggest is that the way Paul uses the phrase in 1 Corinthians 12:13
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.400]   and the way Luke uses the phrase, or Jesus, reported by Luke, uses the phrase in Acts
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.900]   1:5, are not the same.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.840]   That's my basic premise, which would avoid a lot of confusion if people bought this,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.540]   so you can check it out for yourself.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.560]   Which means that when we ask, "What does the phrase 'baptism in' or 'baptism with the Holy
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.740]   Spirit' mean?"
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:21.400]   We have to ask, "Are you talking about Paul's use or Luke's use?" as he quotes Jesus.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   They're not contradictory.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.720]   I'm not arguing that there's any conflict.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.520]   I'm just saying we use different words, or the same words, in different ways, and they
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.960]   use the same phrase in different ways.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.280]   So let me clarify each of those.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.600]   1 Corinthians 12, Paul says, 12, 12, "Just as the body is one and has many members, and
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.240]   all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.020]   For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.280]   Or you could say, "By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.880]   Jews are Greek, slaves are free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.820]   I think virtually everyone agrees that Paul's understanding here of baptism by the Spirit
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:21.700]   is the act by which the Spirit unites us to Jesus Christ and His body, the Church.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.340]   In other words, it's conversion, it's becoming a Christian.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.540]   This is what it means to be a Christian, to be moved upon by the Holy Spirit in such a
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.380]   way that we are brought to faith and united to Jesus.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.980]   Now I don't think that's the way Jesus and Luke are using this similar phrase in Acts
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.100]   1, 4, and 5.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.660]   Here's what Jesus says as Luke quotes Him in Acts 1, 4, "While staying with them, Jesus
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.740]   ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father,
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.240]   which He said, 'You heard from Me, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.340]   with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.'"
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.100]   That's Acts 1, 4, and 5.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:19.320]   He's quoting John the Baptist from Luke 3, 16, where John says, "I baptize you with water,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.520]   but he who is mightier than I is coming after me, the strap of whose sandals I'm not worthy
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   to untie."
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.160]   He will baptize you.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.400]   He, Jesus, will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:42.680]   Now I don't think Jesus means that His disciples will be converted from unbelief to belief
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.080]   in this baptism that they're supposed to wait for in Jerusalem.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:55.200]   I think Luke sees the apostles as genuine, born-again believers before this promised
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.280]   baptism happens to them.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.320]   Luke ends his gospel like this, with a description of the apostles before the experience that
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.080]   they're supposed to wait for, called the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   It says in Luke 24, 52, "They worshipped Him," they worshipped Jesus, "and they returned
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.960]   to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple, blessing God."
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.120]   So here's a group of men worshipping Jesus, they have great joy, they're blessing God
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.520]   through Jesus in the temple.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   These are not unregenerate disciples waiting to be born again by the arrival of the Holy
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.480]   Spirit.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   What then does Jesus mean in Acts 1, 5, and in Luke 3?
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:50.640]   I think when He says, "You will be baptized with the Holy Spirit," He means you will receive
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.720]   extraordinary power for Christ-exalting ministry.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.920]   That's what I think He means.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   You will receive extraordinary power for Christ-exalting ministry.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:13.040]   Now that experience may come in an unusual, decisive experience after conversion—a day,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:22.600]   a week, a year, it might, or a minute—followed by subsequent outpourings or fillings or baptisms
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.240]   of the Spirit periodically throughout life.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   Or that experience may come at the very moment of conversion, followed by lifelong, subsequent
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.720]   experiences of empowering in the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:47.600]   Or it may come in various ways and fillings and blessings and empowerings of the Spirit
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.040]   throughout a lifetime that are just unpredictable and very various.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:01.860]   So I think it would be a mistake to limit baptism in or by or with the Holy Spirit to
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.200]   a single, second event after conversion.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.920]   Even though you might experience one, that doesn't mean it's the normative way that
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.320]   this baptism is to be understood.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:24.880]   I think the kind of filling and empowering that we receive in such experiences are needed
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.600]   again and again and again in the Christian life.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.920]   And they're not consistently the same in every season of the Christian life.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   It is right, I think, to ask for a fresh baptism.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.560]   That's the language of Puritans, that's the language of Martin Lloyd-Jones, that's
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.840]   my language again and again as I approach the pulpit and seek to preach.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.920]   I say, "Oh God, I need a fresh baptism, I need a fresh anointing, I need a fresh filling,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.400]   I need a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit."
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.320]   I think the language is very various in the book of Acts for these kinds of things, which
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   are not continuous.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:14.840]   You have Paul on Cyprus, and he's about to speak, and it says, "Filled with the Holy
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   Spirit," and then he has an extraordinary power to deal with this magician there on
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   the island.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.720]   That's the kind of thing that I think Jesus was saying, "I want you to know this experience
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.360]   as you head out to evangelize the world."
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:38.160]   Now let me give four quick bullet points of reasons why I think that, why I think Luke
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.240]   and Jesus used the term that way.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.920]   Number one, Luke describes the first baptism with the Spirit as being filled.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   He uses the filling language in Acts 2.4.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.120]   He says, "Wait for this baptism," and then when he describes it in 2.4, he says, "They
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.800]   were all filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.240]   So for him, these are overlapping realities, fullness and baptism, and throughout the book
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.640]   of Acts, the term "filled with the Holy Spirit" is a recurrent, repeated experience in the
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.800]   believer's life, not just a one time.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.720]   That's argument number one.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.700]   Number two, Luke says that being baptized with the Spirit is a fulfillment of the promise
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.400]   of Joel 2.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.000]   Wait for the promise, and then the promise that gets fulfilled is Joel 2 in Acts 2.16
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   following, and the promise of Joel 2 is not the new covenant promise of new birth.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.320]   It's the covenant promise of prophetic power.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.160]   You're going to speak with extraordinary power there in Acts 2.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.200]   Number three, Luke describes being baptized with the Spirit as receiving power for witness
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.000]   when the Holy Spirit comes, Acts 1.8.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.040]   When you receive the Holy Spirit, you will have power so that you can be my witnesses
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.480]   to the end of the world.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   And that's the immediate description of what's going to happen if you wait for the baptism.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.280]   So it's an empowering for global Christ-exalting effectiveness.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   And then finally, number four, Luke says that being baptized in the Spirit is being clothed
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.560]   with power from on high so that the message of Christ can be taken effectively to all
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   the world.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.880]   That's the message of Luke 24.49, where he tells them, "Wait in Jerusalem till you are
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.520]   clothed with power from on high."
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:36.960]   So my understanding of baptism with the Holy Spirit is that Paul uses a form of this phrase
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:44.040]   to refer to what happens at the new birth, and Luke uses a form of this phrase, and Jesus
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:51.960]   quoting Jesus, a form of this phrase for the empowering by the Spirit, which, to answer
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:13:00.800]   the question about the peculiar signs, may or may not include various signs like tongues
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.400]   or other unusual manifestations.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:12.200]   So I think every Christian should seek fresh baptisms in this sense again and again and
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.960]   again for effective ministry.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.240]   So helpful to be careful with the different ways terms and phrases are used by particular
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.480]   authors in the Bible.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.680]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that word.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.000]   And thank you to the listener from Berlin with the excellent question, as always.

[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   We now break for the weekend and return on Monday to talk about Calvinism and Arminianism,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.320]   and specifically in how they differ when it comes to the power of God's grace, the differences
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.080]   between Calvinism and Arminianism on the power of God's grace.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   That is next time.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
