[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Pastor John, here's a question from the news
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.360]   from a listener who asks this.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.280]   I'm struggling with the story of Jerica Bolin
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.800]   in Appleton, Wisconsin.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.640]   There's an enormous amount of support
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.880]   for this 14-year-old girl who is terminally ill
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220]   and has decided to take herself off life support
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400]   in order to end her life faster.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.640]   While I am compassionate about her situation and her pain,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.840]   I am also unsure about whether she has the authority
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440]   to speed her death like this.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.480]   Pastor John, please help us with this question biblically.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.440]   What would you say?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.120]   - As I've been giving some thought to what I might
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000]   be able to say that would be helpful in this regard
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   to the Jerica Bolin situation and her incredible suffering,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.560]   I've thought that perhaps I won't rehearse
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.580]   the arguments, at least not all of the arguments,
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.580]   for why no human being should take his own life
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.680]   since I've tried to do that in several other places
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.020]   to give those biblical foundations.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.900]   Like a couple of years ago, there was another situation
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.500]   where we tried to deal with that.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.160]   And people can go to the website,
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.400]   desireandgod.org, and type in euthanasia,
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800]   and there's four or five podcasts
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.080]   and articles there about it.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640]   So instead, I thought I might be more helpful
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   if I briefly address only one
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.860]   of the absolutely crucial underlying issues,
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.480]   namely the way that God intends for a Christian
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.060]   to deal with ongoing pain.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.780]   This is one of the huge reasons,
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.220]   probably the biggest reason,
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.060]   that people desperately want to end their lives.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060]   They want to be done with suffering,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.340]   which, of course, is understandable.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.180]   The very meaning of pain is that we don't want to have it
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.980]   and we want to be rid of it.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.780]   That's why we call it pain and not pleasure.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.460]   One of the reasons I want to say a few words
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.380]   about that particular point is that
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.900]   even this past weekend, I was out in California
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.180]   talking to very educated, prosperous, professional,
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.180]   technologically savvy, mainly young people,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.580]   and I was told more than once with illustrations
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.740]   that they had been tremendously helped
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.740]   in dealing with totally unexpected, big suffering
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.900]   in their lives, like, for example,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.780]   a child living on a ventilator who's not gonna live
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.160]   till she's probably beyond six years old,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.020]   being told by these young people,
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.560]   people in their 20s and early 30s,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.800]   that they had been helped by being prepared
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.280]   for suffering biblically and theologically
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.100]   before the suffering came.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.940]   And I say it that way because I know
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.620]   that in the very moment of agony,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.700]   teaching and preaching and counseling
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.280]   are generally not what people either need
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.180]   or can even handle.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.740]   All that needs to happen earlier
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.540]   while the mind is clear
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.700]   and the body is not being wracked with pain.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.020]   And I've seen in the last 45 years,
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.100]   one experience after the other, so many of them,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.180]   in people's lives where a biblical orientation
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.820]   on suffering has in fact served profoundly
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.260]   to make the suffering endurable and even significant,
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.860]   even if it's not easy.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.080]   So here are a couple of those aspects
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.580]   of such a biblical, theological,
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.980]   God-centered vision of suffering,
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.240]   all of which are deeply connected with Christ's sufferings,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.140]   which he endured, not mainly so that we would
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.980]   escape suffering in this life,
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.600]   but that we would endure suffering
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.100]   in the hope of everlasting and exquisite pleasure
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.180]   forever and ever in the resurrection.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.180]   So I'm just gonna mention two things and illustrate.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   The first is the Bible teaches us to relieve
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.980]   as much suffering as we can,
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.280]   both in this world and especially in the next,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.380]   but it's this world that we're focusing on.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.180]   When I say we don't have a right to take our lives,
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.180]   I don't mean we don't have a right to minimize suffering,
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.640]   trying to help people get rid of pain.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.480]   That's the first thing.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.700]   The second thing is that the Bible teaches us
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   to squeeze as much Christ-exalting meaning
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.800]   out of our suffering as we can and shows us how to do it.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.060]   So let me take those one at a time.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.740]   Of course, Jesus' command to love your neighbor
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.840]   as you love yourself or to do unto others
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.260]   as you'd have them do unto you,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.980]   isn't that enough to impel us to relieve
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.580]   other people's suffering as much as we can?
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.380]   Because we don't wanna suffer,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.180]   and so we wanna help other people not suffer.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.420]   But let's be more specific.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.660]   1 Timothy 5:23, Paul says to Timothy,
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.980]   "No longer drink only water,
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.900]   but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   and your frequent ailments."
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.980]   Now I was thinking this morning
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.580]   about that term frequent ailments.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.300]   Doesn't the word frequent translate into chronic?
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.620]   They're frequent.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.940]   They keep coming back for poor Timothy.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.060]   And I think the word ailments, weaknesses,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   implies at least distracting discomfort, if not real pain.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.500]   Paul wouldn't bother telling Timothy
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.100]   to work on these with some natural healing efforts
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.460]   if they weren't painful and disabling.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.240]   So I think this passage is a clear illustration
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.160]   of using God-given natural means,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.720]   even medical means of eliminating
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.500]   as much discomfort and pain as we can.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   So that's the first thing to say about pain.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.140]   None of us wants it.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.380]   That's the meaning of pain,
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.020]   and therefore we should help each other
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.020]   get rid of it if we can.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.660]   And the second thing is that the Bible shows us
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.660]   we should squeeze as much Christ-exalting significance
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.180]   out of our pain as we can.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.780]   Oh my, we need hours to talk about that
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.100]   and meditate on that.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.260]   So let me just point quickly to four passages
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.540]   that people can take away and meditate on
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.660]   and see whether God doesn't shape their heart
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   and their mind so that when the time comes
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.460]   for their chronic pain, they'll be ready.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.300]   Number one, 1 Peter 1, 6 and 7,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.900]   "In this you rejoice," and he's just given about,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.900]   I count, 10 reasons for enormous joy in the future
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.600]   for the Christian, and then he says,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.840]   "In this you rejoice, though now for a little while,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.120]   if necessary, you have been grieved with various trials
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.620]   so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.040]   more precious than gold, which though perishes
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   is tested by fire, may redound, may be found,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   may result in praise and glory and honor
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.960]   Only God knows when our pain is necessary.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.920]   He uses the word necessary.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   Only God knows how to test us with fire
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.480]   so that our goal, our faith,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.640]   will be purified and not destroyed.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.760]   But that's the goal.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.400]   His goal is purification.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.960]   Satan's goal is destruction.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.720]   And so we lay hold on the promise
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.680]   that suffering may be necessary,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.640]   and it's various, and it's grievous,
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.800]   and it is ultimately gonna result in praise
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.380]   and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.880]   Number two, 2 Corinthians 1:9,
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.320]   "We were so utterly burdened beyond our strength
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.920]   that we despaired of life itself,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.900]   but that was to make us rely not on ourselves,
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.640]   but on God who raises the dead."
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.600]   One of the reasons or designs,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.760]   one of the designs in all of our despairing suffering
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.320]   is so that we would be thrown
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.640]   onto the invisible arms of God.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.520]   We can't see them.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.040]   We can't physically feel them.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.560]   And so all we can do, according to Paul here,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.400]   is trust the God who raises the dead,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.760]   which is what the design of that experience was for Paul.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   Third, 2 Corinthians 4:16, "So we don't lose heart.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   Though our outer nature is wasting away,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.980]   our inner nature is being renewed day by day
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.920]   for this light momentary,"
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.740]   which means horrible and lifelong,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.160]   "affliction is working for us
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.040]   the eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison."
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   Now, that text does not say that the affliction is easy.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.500]   It doesn't say that being renewed day by day is easy
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.640]   while the outer man is being eaten away
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.040]   by some horrific disease
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.740]   that we can hardly speak of, it's so terrible.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.680]   But it does say that this is possible
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   because we look not to the things that are seen,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.080]   but to the things that are unseen.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.760]   The almighty God, the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.040]   the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of sins,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.080]   the victory over Satan, victory over hell,
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.560]   hope of everlasting joy,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.160]   those are the unseen things that we squeeze onto
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.080]   and squeeze meaning and significance.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   And the last one I would mention is Romans 8, 22, 23.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.200]   We know that the whole creation has been groaning together
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.920]   in the pains of childbirth until now,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.600]   and not only the creation,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.280]   but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.600]   the redemption of our bodies.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.520]   None of the promises of God
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.360]   keep us from groaning in our pain,
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.000]   but they do keep our groaning
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.080]   from becoming bitterness and despair.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.000]   They turn meaninglessness and misery
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.440]   into waiting for glory.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.400]   Now, I know those two observations
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.960]   are not the totality of the answer to the question
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.760]   about physician-assisted suicide.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.200]   And so I hope our listeners will go and read
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   about Brittany Maynard two years ago
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   and what I wrote there and what other people have written.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.240]   But oh, how crucial it is to get these two things
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.300]   firmly in place in our hearts before our day comes.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.720]   Number one, it is right and good
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.360]   to try to reduce pain in this life and the next.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   And two, it is right and possible with God's help
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.160]   because of Christ and because of hope
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.400]   to squeeze as much Christ-exalting meaning
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.600]   out of suffering as we can.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.560]   - Amen, necessary words.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.280]   Yes, life hacking.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.640]   Our age is abuzz over the latest tricks
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.400]   and shortcuts to productivity and hacks to everyday life.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.240]   And tomorrow we're gonna focus on life hacking gone wrong.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.280]   How does it go wrong?
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.560]   We'll look at the life story of one prominent individual
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.960]   in which it did.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.800]   You don't wanna miss it.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.640]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast

[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.

[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.640]   (silence)
