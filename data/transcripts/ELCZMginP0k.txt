[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440]   with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.780]   Well this morning Billy Graham walked through the valley of the shadow of death and into
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.960]   the arms of the Savior he served so faithfully over the decades.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.920]   He was 99 years old.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.200]   Pastor John, Billy Graham was a formative influence on you and your ministry and I wanted
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.440]   to jump on the phone with you today to record a special episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.120]   to get your immediate response on what's going through your mind today, what you're thinking
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.600]   about right now, the memories that are coming back to you as you process this news.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:49.400]   Billy Graham, when I was growing up as a teenager and even today in my experience, I said to
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.360]   Noel this morning, "He was just larger than life."
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.400]   I didn't expect to get this emotional.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:15.680]   I can remember standing as a 15-year-old on the porch beside the basketball backboard
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.160]   that was fastened to it.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   It's funny how clear this is.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.320]   And thinking, "What would we do if Billy Graham died?"
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.160]   What that captures is an immature kid who doesn't have a big grasp of the sovereignty
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.640]   of God yet, and yet a profound love for Billy Graham and a profound sense that he's a big
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.560]   deal in my world and he was a big deal in our world.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:59.600]   He embodied, for John Piper, my parents' religion written across the sky because he was globally
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.960]   known and globally significant, and yet every word that seemed to come out of his mouth
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.800]   could have come out of my father's mouth or my mother's mouth.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.960]   And so it was a massive affirmation that the same glorious good news was being heralded
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.200]   by this man that everybody seemed to respect and what I was being taught at home, which
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.400]   gives to a kid, a teenager, a sense of, "Wow, I'm really on to something glorious here,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.240]   something solid, something that responsible, respectable, smart people embrace."
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   Isn't that amazing that it would have that effect on me as a kid?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.160]   I mean the same basic good news.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.840]   God is holy and demands allegiance.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   Every person on the planet is a sinner.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.160]   God is merciful and sent Jesus, his Son, to die in the place of sinners and believe on
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.920]   the Lord Jesus and you shall be saved.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.480]   So that basic gospel was my life as I was growing up.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   And there he was saying it on the television and in these massive crusades over and over
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   again.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.860]   And he embodied the same evangelistic fervor that my dad had.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600]   He preached with the Bible folded back in his hand saying, "The Bible says, the Bible
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   says."
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.920]   And every time he said that, I said, "That's my book.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.340]   That's what I believe."
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.580]   Some authoritative preaching.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.120]   What simple power he had when he opened his mouth.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.000]   You know, a sentence that someone else might say and that he might say, they just have
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.120]   a cataclysmic difference in their effect because of the anointing that seemed to be on Billy
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.240]   Grimm's authority in preaching.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.880]   Same joyful confidence in life.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.760]   I mean, he'd go on to all these TV shows where his unbelievers would supposedly try
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.120]   to get at him and he was just utterly unruffled by anything and could stand his ground with
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.240]   the simple gospel.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.480]   And he stood for the same basic lifestyle of sexual purity and personal holiness that
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.760]   I was being brought up on.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.000]   Same connection with—here's a little personal touch—I mean, Cliff Barrows, the so-called
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.520]   song leader, lived in our town, and I went to school with his kids, and I saw Cliff Barrows
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.960]   often and we did various things together as a family.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.760]   So I felt like, "There's this man leading this 5,000-person choir, and I know him, and
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.060]   I go to school with his daughter."
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.160]   So this was, for me, a very personal connection, not just a formal or religious one.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.080]   I met Billy Grimm one time.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.960]   I was 14 years old, and it was at Cliff Barrows' house, and it was some Christmas party or
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   something.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.560]   I'm not sure why I was there, but there I was, and my main impression was, "This
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   man is tall!"
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:16.400]   I mean, my dad is 5'7", my mom is 5'1", my sister's 5 feet, my grandmother was 5'1",
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.080]   I was the giant in the family at 5'9", and here's this gargantuan public figure
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.800]   towering over me, and I was just amazed that I got to shake his hand as a kid.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:43.040]   His life, that public, big, global dimension, I think had both positive and negative effects
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.840]   on the church or on American culture.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.440]   Let me try to explain what I mean.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720]   Positive in the sense that Billy Grimm imparted, as you can tell from what I'm saying, great
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.480]   courage to believers, evangelical believers, to speak their faith, because there he was
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.840]   doing it on the television.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.240]   And it also was positive in the sense that his public preaching forced Jesus into the
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.440]   public arena, into the public square, you might say.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:31.240]   But the downside seems to me to be that inevitably there became a blending of evangelical Christianity
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.960]   that he stood for and I stood for, and the dominant American culture, because Billy Grimm
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.480]   really was a quintessential American as well as a dominant voice for evangelical religion,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:56.880]   and therefore there emerges this wedding, often uncritical wedding, of evangelical Christianity
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:06.560]   and American culture, which I think we are still paying the price for today.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.720]   And it had a couple of negative effects.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:17.600]   One, it took away the prophetic edge of the faith, because if you're wedded with the culture
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.960]   so intimately, how can you stand outside or over the culture and make prophetic statements
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.200]   of criticism about the culture?
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.080]   And the second negative effect it had—and this I think we've only recently begun to
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:43.440]   talk about more clearly and forthrightly—is that it made the white, Protestant, evangelical
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.160]   church virtually unconscious that it had a culture.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   When you're swimming in the water, you don't know there's water.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.440]   It's just what you are.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.920]   And of course, we have over the recent decades awakened globally and in America to the fact
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.280]   that outside of the kind of evangelicalism that Billy Grimm embodied, there are other
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   expressions, cultural expressions, of biblical Christianity all over the world as well as
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.800]   in America, and we were basically oblivious to that.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.880]   And when you're oblivious of something, you can make some really unhelpful assumptions
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:34.600]   that put people outside that sphere into a light that is not going to be helpful or unifying.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:43.000]   And to his great credit, Billy Grimm, I think, awakened in some measure to the dangers of
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.300]   this cultural conformity and/or the wedding of evangelicalism with the faith and began
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.080]   to say things that were very, very helpful.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   I've got an article that I think we're going to put up over at Desiring God today where
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.360]   I quote Martin Luther King to the effect that he said at one point that he thought the Billy
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:13.160]   Grimm crusades after the requirement for integration were some of the strongest impacts for the
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.720]   good of the fight for integration that happened in those days.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.960]   So anyway, the public nature of Billy Grimm proved to be both, I think, very positive
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.320]   and had these negative downsides.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:36.960]   You know, one other thought is the fact that I love to talk about Christian hedonism.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:44.760]   That's who I am, what I've lived for and stood for and tried to say in all my books and preaching,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.800]   namely that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him and that the
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.940]   satisfaction in Him comes to its peak when it overflows in joy in God that meets the
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.940]   needs of others.
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.600]   In other words, it produces love.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   And Billy Grimm, in his own interesting way, fed this, I believe.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.480]   I was just thinking about this this morning and even came to tears again in my devotions
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:22.600]   as I was singing "Just as I Am" to myself, because that song, which he ended every service
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.440]   with, "Just as I Am, without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me, and that thou
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.400]   bidst me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come," it has a verse in it, as if that weren't good
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:46.960]   enough, "Just as I Am, poor, wretched, blind, sight, riches, healing of the mind, yes, all
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.280]   I need in thee I find, O Lamb of God, I come."
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.680]   That's a massive statement, isn't it?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.280]   All I need in thee I find, which if people were listening, they had to realize Jesus
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.960]   is not a ticket, not a ticket out of hell into heaven.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.640]   He is heaven.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.120]   He's everything we need.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.720]   He is the end of the soul's quest, sight, riches, healing of the mind.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.840]   Yes, all I need in thee I find, O Lamb of God, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.560]   That's my Christian hedonism.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.000]   And I sang it hundreds of times.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.600]   We sang it at church, we sang it at crusades, we sang it at home.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   Yes, all I need in thee I find.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.480]   And then there was one other signature song, right?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.760]   How great thou art, and I can see Cliff Barrows, one of the happiest people I've ever known.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.160]   I met him recently as we were talking, and he's blind, and he has hundreds of hymns memorized,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.520]   and he just overflows with joy.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:06.600]   Well, there he was, the big smile on his face, leading 5,000 people in "How Great Thou Art,"
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   which has this verse in it.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.560]   And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.440]   that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.560]   I wonder if we ever let that sink in, for the joy that was set before Him, it streamed
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.400]   back in, and even in Gethsemane and on the cross, He was sustained.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:40.340]   He was not begrudgingly giving His life, He was gladly giving His life for us.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.760]   Or the next verse, "When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation, then take me home,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.680]   what joy shall fill my heart, and then I shall bow in humble adoration."
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.360]   There's the connection between joy filling the heart and humble adoration, which is what
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.600]   I've been arguing all my life, namely that the only adoration that honors God is the
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.560]   adoration that is overflowing with joy in God.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.460]   You can't have dutiful adoration.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.160]   It's either real in your heart, or it's not.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   So I thank God that the entire team of the Billy Graham crusade efforts, with the music
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:31.840]   and the preaching, were feeding my convictions about God being most glorified in us when
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.920]   we're most satisfied in Him, even before I knew that sentence or knew the term "Christian
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.320]   hedonism."
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:45.440]   So Tony, when I step back and just ask about what was His greatest impact, both on the
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:55.200]   world and on me, my answer is thousands and thousands of people came out of darkness into
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   light.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.400]   Their eyes were opened through the work of the Holy Spirit in the mouth of Billy Graham.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.720]   Jesus said to Paul, "I'm sending you to open their eyes."
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.800]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.080]   "I'm sending you to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   the power of Satan to God, and that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.120]   those who are sanctified."
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.440]   That's what happened to thousands and thousands of people.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.120]   So if you talk about impact, how can you measure the impact when somebody is not going to go
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.580]   to hell and spend eternity in misery, but is going to have everlasting joy in the presence
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:43.420]   of God because this man opened his mouth, and God Almighty used him to rescue thousands
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.280]   and thousands of people from everlasting destruction?
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.400]   Not to mention the earthly impact of all those thousands of people who turned from darkness
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.720]   to light, and therefore their actions are transformed, and their marriages are saved,
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.320]   and their children are reared in righteousness, and they're honest now at work, and their
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:10.400]   sexual relations are pure, and they do countless good deeds done for the physical good of others
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   and the eternal good of others, as is so wonderfully embodied in his son's life today, Franklin's
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   ministry, Samaritan's Purse.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:29.440]   For me, personally, I would have to say that the greatest impact, since I was already a
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.920]   believer when I got to know who Billy Graham was, the greatest impact was that today I
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   still love the old, old story.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:48.440]   I love the gospel that Billy Graham preached, and I love saying out loud with people or
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.320]   privately to God, "How great thou art."
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   That's awesome.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.480]   Are there any distinct marks of his ministry beyond the Christian hedonism that he talked
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.480]   about?
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.360]   Are there things that you picked up from him that transferred into your ministry?
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.600]   Do you hear yourself in him?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.760]   How did he influence you in other ways?
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:11.040]   Well, I hope—I've already mentioned them in bullet point—but I hope that I have been
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:18.760]   a biblically faithful preacher who may not have said the words the Bible says as often,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.360]   but oh, it was implicit.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.440]   I've always wanted to preach in such a way that nobody cared a hoot what John Piper thought,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:35.640]   but rather, "Look, he's showing us what God says in the Bible," which is what Billy
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.040]   Graham showed us over and over again.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.000]   The Bible says, the Bible says, the Bible says.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.160]   And that's the kind of ministry I have wanted to have, I want to have, I want Desiring God
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.120]   to be that kind of ministry.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.040]   Bible-saturated is the way I talk about it.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.560]   Not just Bible-based preaching, like you say a verse and then you spend 30 minutes talking
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.800]   about stories that you've experienced instead of telling people what's in the Bible and
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.320]   quoting it to them and applying it to their lives.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.160]   So that's one thing.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.920]   And another is a clarity and directness.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:18.880]   I mean, when he opens his mouth and speaks, there's such pointed, forceful, unabashed,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440]   unhypocritical clarity.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.280]   He's just right straight to the point.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.040]   And I want to be clear, I don't want to be clever.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:35.160]   I just want my preaching to be clear and anointed and authoritative and forceful the way his
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   was.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160]   I can definitely see that.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.520]   I mean, I can definitely, when I listen to Graham, I can hear some Piper in there, very
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.320]   much an influence.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.440]   A few years ago, you met with Graham again.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.960]   Was anything to share from that meeting, anything stand out?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.840]   You know, that's right.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   When was that?
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   Do you remember?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.800]   Three or four years ago.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.520]   What a gracious man.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.240]   He had a little tube in his nose, you know, but he could sit up.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.400]   He walked in and sat down and we were there.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.040]   I think Justin Taylor was with me and we chatted about various things.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.120]   And the impression everybody gets when they're in the presence of Billy Graham is of a gracious
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.440]   Southern gentleman who puts you first.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.440]   He doesn't default to himself.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.720]   He defaults to the person that he's talking to and he draws you out.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.640]   You're there, you want to, you know, we're going to draw him out.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   Tell me some interesting stories from your life.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.500]   And the next thing you know, he's asking you questions about your life and your ministry.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:46.640]   It was precious in that it simply put a flesh and blood, kind of a closing of the brackets
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:54.440]   of my life from the first time I met him at age 14 until I guess I was about 69 or 68
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.520]   when that meeting happened.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.400]   And to have that kind of closure was very, very precious.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.680]   Some people are saying with the death of Billy Graham now that there's a major chapter in
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.960]   American evangelicalism that's closed.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.120]   Not just his life, but like a chapter of American evangelicalism.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.640]   Do you get that sense at all?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.680]   Is that reading too much into it?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.220]   I can see what they mean.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:24.400]   There was a group, a very dominant, strong group of newer evangelicals, I guess they
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.000]   were called from the late 40s, and over the next 20 or 30 years with their dominance of
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.640]   creating institutions like Fuller Seminary and Christianity Today and represented by
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.520]   Wheaton College.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:47.700]   And I get that, that there was a kind of remarkable unity around that mid-20th century expression
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:55.060]   of evangelicalism, and it has lasted, and that he's the last, one of the last, dominant
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.100]   figureheads in that movement.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.620]   My own sense, though, is that what God is doing in the world is so inscrutable.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.500]   How inscrutable are your ways?
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.220]   How unsearchable are your judgments?
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.480]   Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.880]   I would be very slow to have any neat picture of chapters.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.360]   It just seems to me God's story doesn't break easily into chapters, and so if we're
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.720]   going to talk that way, we better leave lots of holes at the end of the chapter for mighty
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.580]   influences to flow further on, and for those in this chapter, whatever this is, to reach
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.500]   back with benefit.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:44.240]   So yeah, I get that, and I would want to say the God of Billy Graham and the strengths
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.400]   of Billy Graham are alive and well today.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.720]   Outstanding.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.640]   Would you mind leading us in prayer, maybe, to close, to thank God for Billy Graham's
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   life?
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   That would be a pleasure.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:08.280]   Father, I feel today thankful for my father, who was like a little Billy Graham with his
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.960]   500-person evangelistic crusades, and Billy with his 50,000 evangelistic crusades, and
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:26.320]   I simply stand in awe of the faithfulness and the power of these men in the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   I bless you that you raised up Billy Graham for the season that you did.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.280]   I bless you that you preserved him from scandal and unbelief.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:45.440]   I bless you for pouring out your Holy Spirit on him and all the difficulties surrounding
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:53.560]   an evangelistic life in the family, and yet preserving his marriage and preserving his
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:01.780]   witness and anointing him for the gathering of tens of thousands—yes, probably hundreds
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.920]   of thousands—of your lost sheep.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:14.040]   So God, receive our thanks, and I pray that whatever chapter is closing, this next chapter
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:23.440]   that we are in would be even more fruitful, a thousand times more fruitful, not over against,
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.640]   but in part because of Billy Graham.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.520]   As we get older, life is pressing in on us.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.280]   Get all you can out of it now.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.940]   That's the philosophy of many here in South Florida.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.080]   You don't have long.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.240]   You'll be in eternity.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.520]   And the decision you make tonight may decide where you'll be.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.760]   Do you know Christ?
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.600]   The Bible uses the word "depart."
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   You see, the Bible teaches that we're citizens of two worlds now.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.680]   I'm a citizen of the United States, but I'm also a citizen of heaven.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:13.200]   I'm a citizen of another world, heaven, and that's where I'm going.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.760]   And I'll be there.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.880]   It won't be too many months or years before I go.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.240]   The vast majority of my life has already been lived.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.120]   My record has already been made.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.920]   I don't have very much longer.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.680]   I know that.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.960]   I don't plan to retire.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.200]   I feel like I'm 18 years of age, but I know that I'm not.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.640]   I can look at the x-rays when they take the x-rays and see deterioration of a bone here
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.680]   and there through something that I don't even know what it is.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.880]   I can't feel it, but I know at some point I'll feel it.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.200]   It'll start having its effect on the body.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   We all die.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.240]   I'm not going to escape it.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.400]   I don't want to escape it.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:08.920]   I want to go, because to be with Christ is far better than to be even in Florida.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.280]   Someday you'll read or hear that Billy Graham is dead.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.440]   Graham once wrote, "Don't you believe a word of it.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.880]   I shall be more alive than I am right now.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   I will just have changed my address.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   I will have gone into the presence of God."
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:32.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
