[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.800]   There are people now who are no doubt mulling over the achievements that they would like to
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.700]   accomplish in the coming year. We're talking about how you view yourself, how you look at your own
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.880]   life. There's the promise of God that He knows best and will empower you to be everything that
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.000]   He wants you to be. I think this is at the foundation of how a Christian views his life.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.060]   You're not your own. You are bought with a price.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.620]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:01:09.580]   Perspective is really important and even self-speak, as it's often called today. What you say to yourself
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.460]   about yourself and about your own life is very, very important.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.920]   There are people now who are no doubt mulling over the achievements that they would like to
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   accomplish in the coming year, the direction they would like to see their life take. But before you
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.580]   ever get to those kinds of things, there are some other things that you need to think about in terms
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.940]   of creating a structure and a paradigm for how you live your life as a Christian. And to take a look
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.440]   at those, I want you to go in the New Testament to the first epistle written by Peter. We're talking
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.520]   about how you view yourself, how you look at your own life. And let me just say that there are a few
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.480]   things that Peter tells us that set really an incomparable structure for how to view your life as
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.400]   you move forward. Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.440]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:34.420]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of the New Testament. Of an appropriate view of oneself as a Christian. Remember who owns you. Remember who owns you. You will notice in chapter 1 of 1 Peter, verse 18. You were not redeemed or purchased or bought with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.420]   Number one, and here's what I think is the beginning point of an appropriate view of oneself as a Christian. Remember who owns you. Remember who owns you. You will notice in chapter 1 of 1 Peter, verse 18. You were not redeemed or purchased or bought with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:46.140]   "But with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.820]   Then verse 21, "Through Him you have become believers in God."
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.120]   What that's telling us is that God owns us because He purchased us.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:07.100]   Acts chapter 20 verse 28 says that God bought us with His own blood.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:19.180]   Chapter 2 of 1 Peter verse 9, "Since you have been purchased by God, you are a chosen race,"
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.380]   Christians collectively, "a royal priesthood, a holy nation," and then this, "a people for
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.100]   God's own people."
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.820]   Possession.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.880]   Christians are slaves owned by God.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.940]   1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20 says, "You're not your own, you're bought with a price."
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.240]   We know from the New Testament that you were chosen before the foundation of the world.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.260]   Your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.780]   You were chosen to be given to Christ as a part of His bride.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.460]   In time, the Holy Spirit convicted you, you were brought to salvation, and you came to
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.080]   be the possession of Christ.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.100]   John 6 says, "You were given to Him by God the Father."
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.880]   He paid the price, His blood, so that God could take you, own you, and then give you
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.100]   to Christ as a gift of His love.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.500]   I think this is at the foundation of how a Christian views his life.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.520]   You're not your own.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.420]   You are bought with a price.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.920]   You are not your own.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.060]   And at all junctures, you have to constantly remind yourself.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.880]   I'm not my own.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.260]   I'm not a master of my own fate.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.420]   I'm not the captain of my own destiny.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.500]   I'm not in charge of my own life.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.940]   I belong to God.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.240]   Yes, there is a giving up of prerogatives.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.300]   There's a giving up of personal ambitions.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.020]   But at the same time, there's the promise of God that He knows best and will empower
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.020]   you to be everything that He wants you to be, which is far more than you would ever
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.080]   be on your own.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.040]   Everything starts with righteousness.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.100]   It's remembering who owns you, who bought you at an immense price, the blood of the
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.280]   Lord Jesus Christ, the purchase price.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.080]   The picture here is a picture of a slave being bought with an extreme price, not silver,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   not gold, but blood, not just anyone's blood, but the blood of the sinless Son of God.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   So that's where it starts.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.020]   Let me give you a second one that's related to this.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.840]   It's part of the perspective grid that every Christian needs to have.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.460]   It is this: remember who owns you.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.880]   Secondly, renew your oath of obedience.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.300]   Peter is an apostle of Jesus Christ, verse 1.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:50.680]   He's writing to believers who reside as aliens in the world, as we are all aliens scattered
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.240]   throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithynia.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   They are chosen.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.000]   They're the elect, chosen by God.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.060]   According to His predetermined knowledge.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.380]   Then he says this, "They are elect according to the foreknowledge of God by the sanctifying
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.420]   work of the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ."
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's the whole point of your salvation is to bring you into obedience to Christ.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.440]   This is not a burdensome obedience.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.980]   This is a joyful obedience because obedience produces what?
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.980]   Blessing.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.940]   It produces blessing in this life, grace upon grace, and it also produces reward, eternal
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.320]   reward in the life to come.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.920]   But you may not have realized that when you came to Christ and you confessed your sin
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.580]   and your sinfulness and you asked Him to save you from your sins and to become your Lord
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.460]   and Savior, inherent in that was an oath of obedience.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.960]   You were saying, "I confess Jesus as my Savior."
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.500]   My Lord.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.900]   What that means is if He's your Lord, you're His slave.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.460]   There was inherent in that confession an oath of obedience.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:16.820]   And then in a most interesting statement in verse 2, Peter says this, "To obey Jesus Christ
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.700]   and be sprinkled with His blood."
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.720]   What does that mean?
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.940]   That's not talking about salvation as regards His death on the cross.
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.460]   There's nothing about being sprinkled with the blood of Christ in any of the epistles
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.620]   of the New Testament.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.500]   So what in the world is Peter referring to?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.240]   What do you mean, "Obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood"?
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.260]   Well Peter is an Old Testament scholar.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.180]   He knows his Old Testament.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.300]   And I'll show you where he drew this from.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.920]   Go back to Exodus, the second book in the Old Testament and the twenty-fourth chapter
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.860]   here.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:05.760]   One of the most interesting events between God and His ancient people, Israel.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.960]   Moses, you know, has been given the Law, right?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.720]   It's laid out in the twentieth chapter.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.640]   And he brings it before the people and he starts unfolding what it is that God wants
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.960]   them to do.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   He lays out the Law of God.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.680]   Verse 3, "Moses came, recounted to the people all the words of the Lord, all the ordinances,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.900]   and all the people.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.700]   And Israel answered with one voice and said, 'All the words which the Lord has spoken we
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.200]   will do.'"
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.940]   Now that is an oath of obedience.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.400]   So half of the blood, the blood is all collected from these animals, half of it is put into
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.240]   saucers and half of it is put on this altar.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.120]   Then he took the book of the covenant that he had written down and read it in the hearing
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.880]   of the people and they said again, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.960]   be obedient."
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.400]   Now in ancient times, how did they seal a promise?
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.500]   What did they use to seal a covenant or a promise?
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   Blood.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:16.120]   So Moses took the blood and literally sloshed it on the people, those large saucers he just
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.180]   threw at the people.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.020]   That's what Peter has in mind.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:27.860]   Let's go back to 1 Peter with that scene vividly on our thoughts.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:35.360]   "When you came to Christ and Jesus Christ promised you blessing and grace and mercy
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:46.980]   and forgiveness and hope and joy and salvation, He made His part of the promise."
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.980]   And what was yours?
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.240]   "To obey Jesus Christ," which is just another way to say to confess Him as your what?
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.840]   Your Lord.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   "And it's as if at that moment blood was splattered on you in the same way that it
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.900]   was splattered on the children of Israel at Sinai back in Exodus 24."
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.520]   I know we all struggle with spiritual obedience.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.360]   I know we all struggle with being everything that we want to be.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.760]   But the struggle becomes much easier and the victory much more likely if you renew this
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.820]   covenant, this oath on a constant, regular basis.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.240]   Every time you sing of the Lordship of Christ, every time you confess Jesus as Lord in a
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   prayer and address Him as your Lord and your God, you are affirming again your pledge to
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.780]   be obedient.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.200]   That needs to be in the forefront of your mind.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.620]   True disciples continue in obedience to His revealed Word.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.800]   And for us, it's not the Mosaic Law, it's all that is contained in the New Testament,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.300]   the gospel.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:06.320]   So as you look at your Christian life, start with remembering who owns you and then renew
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.700]   the oath of the covenant you made at your salvation, a covenant of obedience.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:22.620]   Number three, and this is a very important one, remain faithful to biblical convictions.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.780]   Remain faithful to biblical convictions.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:34.080]   Verse 113, this is a very, very important statement.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:43.660]   Literally the text is saying, "Tie up all the loose ends in your mind."
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:49.060]   It's a picture of somebody, a soldier, let's say, who has a loose garment and he's going
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.540]   into battle getting all the loose ends and sashing it up tight so things aren't blowing
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.860]   in the breeze.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.760]   "Tie all the loose ends."
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.480]   Loose ends together.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.540]   "Gird up your loins," is what the authorized version said.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   Tie everything loose.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.880]   That was actually how soldiers went into battle.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.640]   They wore a kind of a modified dress, as you know.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.740]   You've seen pictures of Roman soldiers and they would be easily victimized or more easily
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.400]   victimized if they got into battle with their garments flying around in the breeze.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.740]   So they tied them down tightly, pulled up the corners of the tunic inside.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.940]   They did everything they could to minimize anything that someone could grab hold of or
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.320]   that might be harmful to them.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.400]   That's exactly what Peter is saying.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.340]   Tie up all the loose ends of your life, all your loose thinking.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:48.020]   Make sure your doctrine is firm, your convictions are strong, and be faithful to your biblical
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.600]   convictions.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.540]   First you read the Bible, you get information.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.040]   You come to understand what it says.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.720]   Then as you continue to read the Bible, you get information.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:04.960]   As you continue to read the Word of God, that information becomes belief.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.860]   And that belief then becomes conviction.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.760]   And conviction is what I believe so firmly that it controls my life.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.720]   And conviction then ultimately becomes affection.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.840]   And that's when you say with David, "Oh how I love your Law."
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.540]   Remain faithful to your biblical convictions.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.060]   Don't be hypocritical.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.700]   Don't be double-minded.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.380]   Don't be duplicitous.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:39.000]   Another way to view that, and I love this instruction in 1 Corinthians 16:13, we read
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.600]   this, "Be on the alert.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.460]   Stand firm in the faith.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.080]   Act like men.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.180]   Be strong.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.560]   Act like men.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   Be strong."
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.400]   Now that's addressed not only to men but to women, and not only to adult men and women
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.680]   but to everybody in the body of Christ and the family of God.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.420]   Be on the alert.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:07.920]   Stand firm in the faith, unwavering, uncompromising, faithful to what you know, what you believe,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.360]   about which you hold convictions and find a developing affection.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.200]   So I say to you, as you reset the button, thinking about how you view yourself in the
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:26.440]   future, remain faithful to biblical convictions, faithful to biblical truth, know the Law of
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.560]   God.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.780]   Believe the Law of God.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.060]   Be convinced about the Word of God.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.820]   Be faithful to the Word of God.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.180]   Develop a strong affection for the Word of God.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:44.880]   Number four, and this is a very important principle of life that Peter makes reference
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.160]   to, recognize all sin as a violation of a relationship.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.340]   Recognize all sin as a violation of a relationship.
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.440]   You know, the world is full of people who violate the law.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.620]   They violate the commandments of God, break the commandments of God.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.200]   Unbelieving people break His commandments all the time.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.820]   But they have no relationship to Him.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.900]   This is a violation of His Law that will result in their judgment.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:20.660]   But believers, we have a completely different condition in which we function because we
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.400]   are the children of God, are we not?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.540]   He is our Father.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.320]   He has caused us to be like this.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.940]   He has caused us to be born into His family spiritually.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:37.400]   Furthermore, He has given us all the rights and privileges of an honored and adopted child.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.500]   We belong to God.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.760]   We have a relationship to Him.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.300]   We have a relationship to Christ.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:55.420]   Sin for us is not simply violating an objective law, it is breaching a relationship.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.200]   In 1 Peter 1.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:07.620]   14, you could read the verse where it says, "Don't be conformed to the former lusts which
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.740]   were yours in your ignorance."
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.400]   And we would understand that.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.120]   Don't live the way you did before you were saved.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.680]   Don't go back to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.760]   Don't live sinfully the way you used to live.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:27.080]   But the reason you don't do that is at the beginning of the verse, "As obedient," what?
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   "As obedient."
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.920]   You have a relationship with God.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.380]   You are His child.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.600]   He's your Father.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   And you should be like Him, verse 15, "but like the Holy One who called you into His
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.120]   family."
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.260]   Be holy yourselves also in all your behavior because it is written, "You shall be holy
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.020]   for I am holy."
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.420]   That's repeated all through the book of Leviticus.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.120]   Be holy because I'm holy.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.960]   You're My children.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.580]   You're connected to Me.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.500]   Be holy the way I am holy.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:08.920]   Demonstrate My life in you through your life.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:17.420]   You know, I think it really helps in dealing with sin to see every sin as a violation of
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:24.220]   a relationship with a loving, gracious, merciful God who chose us for eternal glory before
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.840]   the foundation of the world.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.620]   He gave us time, forgave all of our sins, and promises us eternal bliss in heaven.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.440]   How can I violate that relationship?
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.840]   That's how we have to think.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.720]   Number five, render love always to others.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.260]   Have a life marked by love.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:54.220]   First Peter 1 verse 22, "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls,"
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.720]   yes, you obeyed the gospel truth.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.480]   Souls have been purified, wonderful truth.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.340]   "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls," to what end?
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.220]   For a sincere love of the brethren.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.580]   One of the products of being saved is you love other believers.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.860]   There's a new level of friendship, isn't there?
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.680]   New level of comradery.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.480]   A new level of enjoyment of those who are also in Christ because you have something
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.600]   profound and something eternal that you both hold.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.900]   And that doesn't mean you don't love everybody.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.320]   You do.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.540]   God so loved the world, He loves everyone and we love everyone.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.160]   But there's a unique sense in which we love believers.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:45.720]   That's why He says at the end of verse 22, "Fervently love one another from the heart
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.780]   because you've been born again of an imperishable seed."
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.280]   In other words, you now have an eternal life principle operating in you that produces a
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.480]   love for others.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.600]   For other believers, that is to be fervent.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.240]   Fervent is a Greek word that means stretched, ectonis .
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   It was used of a muscle that was stretched to its absolute maximum capacity.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:19.400]   And what Peter is saying is love to the maximum of your capacity to stretch.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.740]   Render love to others.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.260]   Our lives are to be marked by love.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.360]   Quickly three more.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.780]   Guard highly the effects of adversity.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.940]   Relish the effects of adversity.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.580]   Cherish the effects of adversity.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.200]   Chapter 1 verse 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.800]   to His great mercy caused us to be born again to a living hope, to the resurrection of Jesus
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.960]   Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance," this is all the good stuff, "an inheritance
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.040]   imperishable, undefiled, will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.240]   You have an inheritance, you're protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.740]   to be revealed in the last time."
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   That's all good.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.920]   You've been saved, you've been forgiven, you've been promised resurrection and inheritance
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.820]   that can't fade away, undefiled, reserved in heaven.
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.500]   You're protected, you're going to reach heaven, that's guaranteed.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.560]   Then verse 6, "In this you greatly rejoice."
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.900]   Of course, in our eternal inheritance.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:26.120]   Even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:33.900]   You know, this idea that Jesus wants everybody healthy, wealthy, prosperous, pain free is
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.180]   just absolutely a lie.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.360]   All this prosperity, health and wealth kind of preaching is a fabrication and a deception.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.980]   You want trials.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.660]   Let me give you one good reason.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.560]   Because verse 7 says, "That's the proof of your faith."
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.000]   That's the proof of your faith.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.760]   That's the proof that your faith is real.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.720]   Because if you say, "Oh, I believe in Jesus, I believe in Jesus, I'm a Christian," and
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:10.240]   a trial comes and you collapse under that, start blaming God, deny Him, walk away, then
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.080]   that trial revealed the illegitimacy of your faith.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.360]   But if you're the real thing, the trial may be hard, it may be difficult, it may be painful,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.880]   but when you come out the other side saying, "Glory to God, He has something better, I
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:31.920]   love Him, I love Him, I'll follow Him no matter what the price," you have just had a tremendous
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   gift from God...a tremendous gift from God.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.280]   That's the assurance of the reality of your saving faith.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.640]   Now you know because you passed the trial.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.780]   Then He says this, "How valuable is that?"
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.040]   How valuable is it to know your salvation is the real thing?
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.020]   How valuable is that?
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.760]   It is more precious than what?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   Gold.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.160]   Gold that is perishable.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.660]   More precious than gold.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.900]   I can't think of anything more precious than knowing my salvation is real so that I can
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.400]   fully enjoy it.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:19.760]   And that becomes known to me through trials that test me and I come out triumphant on
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.960]   the other side by the power of God and the grace of God.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.640]   If you're suffering...
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:32.400]   And verse 16, don't be ashamed, glorify God...glorify God.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.140]   And verse 19, entrust your soul to a faithful Creator to do what is right.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:44.420]   He'll protect you, He'll use you, and He'll reward you in eternity.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.820]   Verse 7, cast all your anxiety on Him, He cares for you.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.220]   Verse 10, after you've suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.520]   to His eternal glory in Christ...
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   He's the God of all grace.

[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.680]   He's the God of all grace.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:33.660]   Chapter 3, again verse 21, he says, "Appeal to God for a good conscience."
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.980]   You want a clear conscience.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.520]   One final comment.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.860]   Recognize the supreme purpose of your life.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:48.020]   It really comes down to two things, 1 Peter 2:4 and 5.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.700]   You are, at the end of verse 4, precious in the sight of God.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.160]   You also...verse 5...
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.020]   As living stones...the imagery is in a temple, you're like living stones in a temple built
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.100]   up to the glory of God.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:08.560]   You are built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.040]   acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.400]   What is a spiritual sacrifice?
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.620]   Okay, this is the purpose of my life, to offer up acceptable sacrifices to God.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.620]   What is that?
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.800]   That's worship...worship in every way.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:30.660]   Worship with the mind, worship with the lips, worship with the songs, worship with behavior.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.020]   It's a life of worship.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.560]   So recognize the supreme purpose of your life involves worship.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   Second, this is the companion element.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.540]   Drop down in chapter 2 to verse 9.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.120]   You're a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.440]   Here's the purpose.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:59.680]   "So that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.440]   into His marvelous light."
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.800]   That's evangelism, proclamation.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.940]   Proclaim the excellencies of Christ and the gospel and salvation.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:20.420]   So your life goes upward in worship, goes outward in evangelism.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.080]   That's how you live your life.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.800]   That's how we all live our lives.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.940]   So that in the end, as he says at the end of verse 11 in chapter 4, that in all things
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.640]   God may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom belongs the glory and the dominion
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.700]   forever and ever.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.860]   Amen.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:46.660]   You ought to take so seriously the responsibility to proclaim the excellencies of Him who called
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.000]   you out of darkness into light that you are able to give an answer to the people who ask
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.080]   you questions about it.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.960]   That's what we're called to do.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.500]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.200]   Isn't it amazing how much Scripture comes alive the more we study it?
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.060]   The more we understand what it means by what it says.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:17.260]   Grace To You exists for one purpose: to unleash God's truth one verse at a time.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.720]   For over 45 years, John MacArthur has been doing just that.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:27.680]   The fruit of that labor, in part, is found in the resources available at Grace To You.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.340]   Whether in the verse-by-verse information found in John's Study Bible or New Testament
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:39.160]   commentaries, the thousands of messages available to download or stream free of charge, books,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:46.560]   study guides, we want to be a valued resource here to encourage you as you seek to understand
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.400]   God's Word.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.360]   To take advantage of the resources available, simply visit our website at grace.org/bible.
