[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   A friend of the ministry writes in,
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.640]   "Pastor John, I'm a 24-year-old follower of Christ
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.200]   "who serves as the student pastor
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.640]   "of a small Southern Baptist church.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.000]   "I'm also a full-time student in seminary.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.080]   "My girlfriend and I have been dating for a long time
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260]   "and we both want to move forward in marriage.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.000]   "We have prayed about it and both of our churches
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.980]   "are very supportive of our relationship
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.240]   "and future marriage.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.660]   "The problem is that we don't make enough money.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.080]   "She makes enough to contribute
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.000]   "to our relationship financially, but I do not.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.620]   "I've asked my church to reevaluate my salary,
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.440]   "but they cannot afford to raise it.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.420]   "I work 40-plus hours a week in ministry
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.620]   "and put in 30-plus hours a week in classes.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.940]   "If I take on a second job,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.500]   "I'll be neglecting my girlfriend,
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920]   "my ministry, and my education.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.260]   "So what do I do?"
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.500]   First of all, let me commend our friend
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.040]   for being the one to write with this question
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.800]   instead of assuming that his girlfriend
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.480]   should take the initiative to do that.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.220]   I think that's a good sign that he is ready to step up
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.000]   and do what needs to be done.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I hope so.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.320]   I'm not a believer in long engagements.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200]   Seems to me that there is something,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   especially in our culture, that is unnatural and unwise
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.720]   when a couple knows that they're heading for marriage
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.460]   and others have confirmed that wisdom.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.080]   Unnatural to keep putting it off
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.120]   for various practical reasons.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.880]   Seems to me that in general,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.140]   if two single people can make a living
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080]   and get along on their own,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.200]   then they can probably make a living
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.120]   and get along together.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.560]   So when Noel and I believed it was time to be married,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.720]   after two years of knowing that it was time to be married,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.160]   and the reason we hadn't moved sooner
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.240]   is 'cause her dad wanted her to finish school,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.280]   so I submitted.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.300]   We finally moved forward
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.580]   without having all the practical questions answered.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.960]   In the same way that a single person
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.160]   might launch out in life
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.260]   without having all the questions answered
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.060]   about how ends are gonna meet.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.180]   We just decided that we'd rather starve together,
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.840]   if necessary, than be comfortable alone, so to speak.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.240]   If I were doing this face-to-face with our friend,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.080]   I would be filled with questions at this point.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.040]   I would be digging into him and his fiance
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   to find out about their motivations,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.600]   their personalities, their discipline,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.960]   their capacities for change and sacrifice,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.440]   and what the practical options are,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.600]   but here I am sitting at my desk
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.020]   and don't know them,
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.780]   and so I'm gonna have to go with generality, so here we go.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.660]   I think there are five or six options in front of you.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.300]   Number one, you could continue to wait
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.540]   until your schooling is done,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.820]   and you have a better-paying job,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.300]   and then move forward.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.460]   I discourage that option,
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.500]   assuming that everybody has given the green light
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.020]   for your marriage that putting it off and putting it off
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.480]   doesn't seem wise to me.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.100]   Number two, your fiance could try
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.320]   to get a new, better-paying job
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.780]   so that she could support you
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.840]   during the remaining years in school while you're married.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.400]   That's the way Noelle and I did it.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.100]   She worked as a secretary in two different ways
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.800]   during my schooling years
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.440]   and was a homemaker for 40-plus years afterwards.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.820]   That was the deal,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.280]   and she was so gracious to help in that way.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   Third, you could resign your position at the church
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.200]   and look for a better-paying job.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   I don't know the degree of your commitment to that church
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.460]   or what the expectations are,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.940]   but that's one option.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.360]   Fourth, and this is the one I would encourage you
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   to think hardest about,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   can you not really lower your expenses
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.800]   as a married couple
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.360]   so that you can actually live on the combined salaries?
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.500]   Really, come on.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.680]   Do you have expectations of how you must live
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.480]   that make this seem impossible when it's really not?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.060]   Are those expectations necessary?
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.380]   Your food's not gonna cost any more
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.040]   than when you live together.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.960]   Depending on where you live now,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   you might be able to find a rental situation
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.720]   that's just as cheap as what you both are doing now,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.560]   and so on.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   My guess is you've thought a lot about this,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.840]   but I don't know,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.160]   and I wonder if you are willing to make the sacrifices
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.140]   so that you can be together.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.980]   And fifth is part of four, really.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.880]   As part of that fourth option,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.060]   you might negotiate with your church.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.700]   If they can't give you a raise,
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.140]   perhaps they could give you access to a living situation,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.580]   like a bedroom in somebody's house or a basement
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900]   or some attached apartment or something
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.700]   that the church would pick up
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.780]   or that would just be offered free
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.900]   by a member in the church who believes in you
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.060]   for a couple of years,
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.180]   and so you get your living situation free
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.680]   as part of the deal for working at the church.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.700]   And the last thing I would say is try to discern
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.080]   if God's leading and calling is on you
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.240]   to move forward now with marriage.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.320]   Is it God's time?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.660]   I know that's subjective and difficult to tell,
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.980]   but is it God's time?
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.860]   And if you sense that it is,
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.420]   as Noelle and I did,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.220]   then expect God to do wonderful things
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.460]   to make life together possible.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.100]   And as part of that, pray together.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.180]   Pray earnestly together that the Lord would open the door
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.620]   for this good thing in your life called marriage.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.260]   - Beautiful, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.900]   This episode was targeting a couple in ministry.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.900]   We also released episode number 295,
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.500]   which is titled "RB2 Financially Unstable to Get Married"
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.580]   and it has some other factors to keep in mind,
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.660]   especially when it comes to the provisional capacity
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.900]   of the man involved.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.640]   Check that out, number 295 in the archive.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.860]   Well, we are always becoming like what we most admire.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.580]   It's one of the most fundamental dynamics
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.580]   of the Christian life.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.240]   It's one of the most fundamental dynamics
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.860]   of what it means to be human.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.940]   John Piper will explain tomorrow how this works.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.780]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.660]   Thanks for making the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.620]   a part of your day.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.200]   (upbeat music)
