[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.960]   the chapter read at the beginning, the second epistle of Paul to the Corinthians in chapter
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.360]   five.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.960]   Taking one of the, any of the first seven or eight verses, verse seven reads, "For we
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.640]   walk by faith, not by sight." Or if you prefer it, the first verse, "For we know that if
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.840]   our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.600]   not made with hems, eternal in the heavens." Or if you like it, "In still another fall."
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.280]   The real question before us is as to whether we really did sing the hymn we've just finished,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:05.200]   meaning it, knowing it to be true. "In heavenly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear."
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.440]   Now that's the question. That hymn is just an attempt to express what we've got laid
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.720]   before us here in this striking language used by the great apostle in this chapter. Now
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.440]   we're looking at this chapter for the seventh time, and all along we've been looking at
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   it from the standpoint I've just been indicating. Here, it seems to me, is the ultimate question.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:42.200]   Here is the final challenge. How do we really face life as it is this evening in this world?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.800]   The gospel is essentially practical. There's nothing more practical in the world this evening
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.480]   than the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm inviting you to consider yourself as you are in this
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.520]   world at this minute. You've heard the latest news. You know the decision in Russia to increase
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.360]   the armaments by a third. You see the preparations for war. Now the whole question is, how do
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.840]   we face all this? How do you face this question if the earthly house of your tabernacle were
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.120]   to be dissolved? In other words, how do you face death? How do you face the possibility
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.960]   of having to die? You know not when. Can you look on with equanimity? Can you utter these
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   words? Can you say, "We know"? Can you say that you're always confident? Can you really
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.560]   sing the hymn we have just been singing? Now that's the question. And I've been trying
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.800]   to indicate that it is here and here alone we have the only adequate answer to the question.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.640]   There is no other. We looked the first Sunday night at the way in which other teachings,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.440]   philosophies, religions, and so on face it. But there's no hope. They're all hopeless.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.760]   They're all baffled and bewildered. But here is a teaching that enables us to say that
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.960]   whatever happens we are always confident. Here is a man who could look into the face
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   of death and still go on undisturbed, unafraid, full of courage, full of assurance. And therefore
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.800]   I've been suggesting that the most important and most urgent thing for us in this world
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.440]   is to know how one comes to this position. How is one to know that heavenly love and
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.760]   to be able to abide in it? Well, fortunately the whole answer is in this one chapter, and
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   we've been looking at it. It comes to this. To be able to speak like this means that we
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   have undergone the profoundest change that a human being can ever know. If any man be
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.920]   in Christ, he's a new creature, a new creation. All things are passed away. Behold, all things
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.040]   are become new. It's only a man who is born again, who is regenerate, who has been given
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.880]   a new life by the Spirit of God who can possibly speak like this and view this last and ultimate
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.440]   question in this way. Very well, but we've also seen this, that a man who does undergo
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.080]   that change has got, as we are told there in the 17th verse, an entirely new view of
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.920]   everything. And we've been looking at these things. He's got a new view of himself. He's
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.880]   got a new view of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's verse 16, isn't it? "Wherefore henceforth
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.240]   know we no man after the flesh, yet though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.800]   now henceforth know we him so no more." He's got a new view of God. He's got a new view,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.040]   as we saw last Sunday night, of the way of salvation. Everything is new. Now this is
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.320]   most important. You see, to become a Christian doesn't mean that you just modify yourself
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   a little bit here or there. No, no, you're absolutely new. The Christian sees everything
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   in an entirely different way from that which characterizes the mind and the outlook of
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   the world.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.480]   But tonight we come to the last step in this argument. He's not only a new view in all
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:35.960]   the respects which I've just indicated, but he has in particular a new view of life in
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.160]   this world and human destiny. Now that's the last step in the argument which we've been
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.080]   following through from point to point. Now this again is something that is absolutely
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   vital. I am stressing these things for this reason. If you want to know the experience
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.120]   of the apostle, which has been the experience of God's people throughout the running centuries,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.680]   if you really want to know the experience behind the hymn we've just sung, well then,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.120]   you have got to accept the teaching of this book as it is, and in all its steps. Leave
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.000]   out any one of them and you'll never get this blessing. That's why they're all vitally
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.080]   important. And now here I say is the last vital one. How do we look at life in this
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.000]   world? How do we view it? There's nothing I suggest to you that is more vital and urgent
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.520]   for our consideration this very night. Now let me put it to you in a somewhat unusual
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.720]   manner for me to do. Let me put to you the position with which we are confronted by quoting
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.640]   you something which I read in a newspaper this last week, which seems to me to put the
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.760]   other side in a most typical, characteristic manner. I'm trying to contrast, in other
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.040]   words, the non-Christian way of looking at this world as it is this evening with the
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.280]   possibility of death, and the Christian way of looking at exactly the same thing. Now
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.120]   here was a letter written to a certain newspaper. It was given great prominence. It was given
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:23.240]   a very big and bold headline, and the headline was this, "Why blame them if they prefer
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.680]   a good time now?" That was the heading put to the letter. And then this was the letter.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.840]   While we all sit back and patiently wait to see whether China will persuade Russia that
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.640]   war, after all, is the best idea to rid the world of capitalism, while we are waiting
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:52.840]   for all this, clergymen still preach about the sins of sex and so on, instead of going
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:59.560]   out into the world and doing something about the mess it's in. After all, the letter
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:07.040]   goes on, when according to a certain well-known political correspondent, when according to
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.480]   this man, one has about six months in which to live, who can blame the younger generation
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.040]   or anyone for that matter, for letting themselves go, and still reading the letter, and having
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:30.200]   a damn good time. Wonderful that, isn't it? The pleasures at hand are far more certain
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.360]   than the rather nebulous ones offered in the next world. Now my sermon tonight, of course,
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.520]   was more or less planned before I read that. We've been working through this for the
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.160]   past six Sunday nights. This is the seventh time. But here it is, you see, presented to
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.080]   us in a dramatic form. This is what he says. Here we are, he says. Six months, perhaps,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:03.320]   to live. The whole question is, how is this dispute between China and Russia to be resolved?
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:09.760]   The Russians say that coexistence is possible, that you needn't have a war, that industrial
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.640]   disputes and so on will very soon turn the whole world into communism so you can get
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.560]   it without a war. No, says the Chinese, it can't come that way. That's a fallacy.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.680]   There's only one way, and that's a shooting war. Now these two countries are about to
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.120]   have a great conference, and you see, this is going to be the urgent question. So, as
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.640]   this man puts it, with about six months to live, perhaps. What are we going to do? He
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.360]   says, there are these clergymen preaching about the sins of sex and so on. Why, he says,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.440]   don't they go out into the world and do something about the mess that the world is
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.280]   in? And he says, who can blame the young people, the younger generation, or indeed, for that
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   matter, anybody, for going out and having this good time? Gosh, he's got to swear about
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   this damn good time. So wonderful. The pleasures at hand are far more certain than the rather
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:10.520]   nebulous ones offered in the next world. Well, that's the very thing I'm talking about tonight.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.800]   That's the very question the apostle makes us face in this great chapter. I don't want
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   to stay with this letter. Isn't it pathetic? Can you imagine anything more pathetic, more
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   hopeless? But you see, this is the typical non-Christian thinking. This is the attitude
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:39.880]   of the men of the world, the men in the street, to Christianity. The thing is rarely childish.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:47.400]   I don't want to wear you with this. You notice the great compliment he pays clergymen. He
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.800]   rarely seems to think that if only the clergymen went out and began doing something about it,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   everything would be put right. I never realized that clergymen were such wonderful people.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.440]   Here are all the statesmen of the world doing their utmost to solve this problem. They can't
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.440]   do it. If only the clergymen went out, they'd solve it. Well, there it is. It shows you
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   how utterly devoid of thought the mind of the world is. And what does he offer? Well,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.600]   nothing but escapism. You see, because the world is in trouble, let's go out and have
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   a good time. What problem does that solve? What difference does that make to anything?
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.640]   But you see, that's the solution. Who can blame them for doing this? Who can blame them
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:40.120]   for being sheer escapists? Just pulling down the blinds, having a drink, forgetting it
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.800]   all for a few moments at a time. But that's not thought, that's not reason, that's not
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   understanding. That's a sheer evasion of the whole problem. It's pure escapism. He
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:57.560]   doesn't begin to think and to ask the right questions. He doesn't raise the question of
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.480]   why is the world as it is. It doesn't occur to him that that's the most important question
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.520]   of all. No, no, he just takes all this for granted. He doesn't understand it. He doesn't
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.680]   know it. He doesn't even want to. Here is the utter bankruptcy of men in sin, men without
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   Christ. It's blind, it's hopeless, he's got nothing to offer. He simply can say, "Let
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:24.360]   us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die." It's all completely hopeless, and
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.600]   doesn't, I say, even begin to raise and to ask the only questions that should be considered
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   at such a time. But thank God, we've got something different, that derided Christianity is the
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.780]   only thing that can face this situation. Now I'm prepared to defend this. I defy you to
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:49.180]   give me any theory, point of view, philosophy, teaching, religion in the world tonight that
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.180]   even begins to answer the question, "Save this blessed gospel of the glorious God."
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.720]   It is the only thing that can enable a man to stand up tonight and look at it all as
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   it is and say, "I know. I am certain. I am sure. I am sure. I am certain."
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   I say the answer is all here. What is it? Well, again, we are going to see that it's
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:23.280]   the exact opposite of that other. Christianity is the exact opposite of every other teaching.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.120]   It's got nothing in common. It is entirely new. Well, what is it? Well, we can put it
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:37.120]   like this, if you like. The Christian in this world walks by faith, not by sight. He walks
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   by faith. His whole life is a life of faith. "What do you mean by that?" says someone.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.800]   Well, it means this. A Christian is a man who lives in the light of all the things we've
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:55.400]   already been considering. That is his faith. It is his faith that teaches him the truth
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.360]   about himself. It is his faith that teaches him the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.240]   It is his faith that tells him the truth about God. It is his faith that tells him the truth
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   about salvation. It is all the faith, this faith by which he walks and by which he lives.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   And what the Apostle is really saying is this, that the Christian in this life and in this
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.760]   world is walking through it all in the light of this faith. Now, it isn't theory. I do
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   want to remind you of this. When the Apostle wrote these words, he wasn't writing on holiday.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   He wasn't writing surrounded by comfort and everything going well and just giving his
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.680]   view of life. No, no. He's been telling us in the previous chapter, "If ever a man was
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.440]   surrounded by trials and troubles and tribulations and problems, it was this Apostle Paul. Everything
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.920]   was going against him. He was being persecuted and maligned. They were threatening his life.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.960]   He was suffering physical illness. No man could have been in a more desperate position."
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   And here he says, "Well, even if I die, if the earthly house of this hour, Tabernacle,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   were dissolved, it's all right." Now then, how is it all right? What enables him to say
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.080]   this? Well, in addition to all the things I've enumerated, we come to this, his view of life.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.440]   And here you'll find something again which is altogether different from everything that
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   is known and believed in by the world. Remember the letter I read to you out of the newspaper,
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.720]   "There's man without Christ. Listen to man with Christ." Why is he so different? Well,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.520]   the answer is this. First and foremost, he understands why life in this world is as it
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   is. Now, that's rather important, isn't it? You see, the thing that baffles these non-Christians
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:53.040]   is as to why the world is as it is. They say, "Surely, we've had two world wars already.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.440]   What they want, are they going to have a third? Are they mad?" Nothing's come of the others
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.360]   but misery and increased troubles, and yet here they are preparing for, "What's gone
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.920]   wrong with men?" And the simple answer is, they don't know. They do not understand. They're
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.640]   completely baffled. You see, their view is that the world is getting better and better.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.320]   Well, then why the trouble? Well, they don't know. They're completely bewildered. Now,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   the Christian starts at once with a different idea. He knows why things are as they are.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.760]   Because nobody likes facing that question. The man who writes his letters to the press,
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.760]   he's not interested in that. He's too superficial in his thinking to get at causes and to go down
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.840]   to the origins of things. Christianity alone does that. The statesmen don't do that. Your
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.680]   philosophers never do it. But here is something that takes us down to the roots, the causes of
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.000]   our ills. The apostle puts it like this, "We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.680]   What does he mean by this? "In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:06.240]   with our house which is from heaven." Now, he starts off by saying this, that this world,
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:15.520]   this life, is one in which a man is burdened. It's a life that makes a man groan. The Christian
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.720]   starts by saying that. It's a life of troubles. It's a life of trials. It's a life of problems.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:31.280]   Now, here is what I call the realism of the Christian gospel. Of course, the clever man
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.680]   who writes the letter to the press, he says, "The pleasures that end are far more certain than the
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:44.080]   rather nebulous ones that are offered in the next world." You see, he's a man of this world. He's a
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.200]   man who really is a realist and he faces things. But of course, he doesn't. That's just his trouble.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   He takes his drink. He has his good time. That's all he wants. He wants ease, happiness. He doesn't
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.000]   want to think. He's afraid to think. That's why you've got your pleasure mania. That's why everybody's
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.600]   spending tonight outside Christianity in some form or another, drugging itself. Drink or cinema,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.440]   this, that, or the other. Getting away from it, escaping. Why? Well, because they dare not think
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.640]   and they can't think. And they're not aware of first principles. But you see, the gospel is realistic.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:23.760]   The gospel doesn't paint your rosy pictures for you. It tells you that this is a world in which
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.880]   we groan. It's a world in which we are burdened. It's a world in which there is cruelty, a world
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.760]   of persecution, a world of quarrels, a world of wars, a world of spite and jealousy and envy.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.600]   That's what this says. That's what it says about life. People don't like it because it says that,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:49.120]   and yet they say they want realism. Well, there is realism. The gospel starts by telling us
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.120]   that this world is like that. And it tells you why it's like that.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:02.000]   Why is it like this? It's like this for one reason only. And that is that man who'd been made by God
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.080]   was fool enough to rebel against God. He thought he could run life and the world better than God.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.360]   He listened to a suggestion which told him that he could do so. And he was ready to believe it.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   Conceit has always been man's trouble. And it's the conceit of the modern man that is
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.840]   the essence of his trouble. He still thinks he can run this world and manage it. But he's failing.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.640]   But he won't admit it. It's always been this rebellion, what is called the fall of man.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:37.280]   Everything that is happening in the world tonight is the result of the fall. It's the result of sin.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:45.680]   It's the result of man's antagonism to God and man's determination to live life apart from God.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:52.640]   It is the sole explanation. If every man in the world tonight believed in God and lived in
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.960]   subservience to him, there would be no crisis, there would be no problem at all. If only everybody
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.120]   in the world lived according to the Sermon on the Mount, all the problems would be immediately
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   ended. But they don't. They rebel against them. They hate them. The natural mind is enmity against
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.720]   God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Now then, all our troubles are
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.520]   due to the fall, rebellion against God, and all the consequences that have followed.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:28.000]   The world is as it is tonight because God is not blessing it. And he is not blessing it because
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.360]   he doesn't believe in him, and because it rebels against him. He's told them that. He's told them
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.680]   that if they rebel, they will be cursed. They have rebelled, they are being cursed. The world
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:47.360]   tonight is not being blessed by God because it spurns his blessings and tries to spit into the
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   face of God. That's why the world is as it is. The Bible starts by telling us this, and then
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.800]   he tells us that because of all this, it is a world which is doomed. It is under the wrath and
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   the curse of almighty God. Now then, the Christian, you see, starts out with that. And because he
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.680]   starts with that, he is not a bit surprised that the world is as it is. He's not disappointed.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   He expects nothing better from it. Indeed, to the Christian, the amazing thing is so often that the
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.520]   world is as good as it is. The amazing thing to the Christian is that God hasn't long since ended
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.800]   it all and blotted this rebellious human race out of existence. He's not a bit surprised.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.480]   In other words, the first thing this Christian view does is to deliver us from that false,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:56.880]   ridiculous optimism which has created such false hopes in the human heart throughout the centuries.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.920]   But you know, you and I are living at a terrible time. Is it the end? I don't know.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.720]   But the optimism is beginning to wear very thin, isn't it? It's not surprising. Look at the world
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.560]   and things that are happening. Look at the way it all seems to be heading up to something.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.120]   Well, now, the Christian starts with this. And you see, in the world tonight,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:22.560]   it is a very great help to understand the cause of it all, and not to be surprised,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.760]   not to be amazed at it all, not to feel that all your theories have been belied,
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.640]   and that all your hopes have suddenly dashed to the ground. The Christian is a man who takes a
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.680]   very pessimistic view of life in this world. Now, that's not a popular thing to say, is it?
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.360]   But it's the truth. That is what the clergymen and the preachers are for. They're not to rush
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.520]   out and try to do what the statesmen can't do. They can't do it any better than the statesmen.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   No, no, the business of the preacher is to tell the truth. And here is the first word of truth.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.560]   If you are pinning your hopes to this world, well, my dear friend, you're doomed to
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:09.680]   disappointment. It is an evil world which is under the curse and the doom of God. In this
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:17.920]   tabernacle we do groan, being burdened. That was the experience of the great apostle. It has been
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.040]   the experience of the saints throughout the centuries. Very well. The gospel then starts
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:28.880]   by helping us with our whole view and outlook upon life in this world. But then, secondly,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:40.720]   because of that, it also helps the Christian to view his own life in this world in an entirely
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:48.480]   different way. Now, you notice it coming out in the chapter. What do you mean, Sir Simon? Well,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.760]   I mean this. The moment a man becomes a Christian, he realizes that this is not the only world.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.920]   That life in this world is not permanent. That's the first thing we've all got to...
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.640]   If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, that's it. Now, this is the thing
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.000]   that troubles the non-Christian, isn't it? Is this going to happen? Is life going to end? Am I going
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.520]   to be killed? Is the world going to end? And this is terrible. This is the end of everything,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.680]   because he's only lived for this world and he knows nothing about any other world. This is all.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:29.760]   No, no, says the Christian. This is not a permanent world. This is only a temporary world.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:40.480]   And in any case, we in this life and in this world are nothing but strangers and pilgrims
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.520]   and journeymen and travelers. That's the whole teaching of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.040]   According to the Bible, this life, this world is only some sort of preparatory school.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.320]   This isn't the real thing. This is only the place of preparation.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.960]   Oh, you've got endless statements of this in the Bible. I suppose the Locus Classicus is the
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.000]   eleventh chapter of the great epistle to the Hebrews. You see, there you've got a gallery of
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.480]   the great men of God in all the centuries, starting back away with Abel, coming along,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:24.320]   you remember, through Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Moses and David and Jephthah and all these men.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.520]   Now, here are the great men of God. Here are the great hearers of the faith. These are men who
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.840]   lived in this world, as life should be lived in this world. Well, what was their secret?
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:42.800]   Well, here's their secret. These men, we are told, were looking for a city which has foundations,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.800]   whose builder and maker is God. There, Ellis, you'd never get that in this world. They say,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.640]   "Here we know continuing city, but we seek one to come." That's their confession.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:04.560]   They all confessed that they were pilgrims and strangers in this world. They were just travelers.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.720]   They all had their eye on something away beyond this world and this life. Now, whether we like
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.520]   it or not, that is their characteristic. That is always the characteristic of the people of God,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.200]   and that was the characteristic of this great apostle Paul. He says, "Our citizenship,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.120]   as Christians, is in heaven. That's where we belong. We are a colony of heaven. We are people
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.520]   away from home." You see, there's nothing in common between this view and the worldly view,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.360]   is there? This is the Christians' way of looking at it all. He's in this world like everybody else,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.880]   yes, but he starts off by saying, "This is not permanent. This is not everything."
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:54.480]   "What is your life? It is but a vapor. Here today, gone tomorrow, this fleeting life of ours."
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.760]   That's the Christian view. Very well, then, there is its essential difference, but it goes on,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   as the apostle puts it here. He says, "For the love of Christ constraineth us,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.480]   because we thus judge, etc., and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them and rose again." Now, there's a fundamental
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.320]   point again. The men of the world, of course, young and Christian, he lives for himself alone.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:34.240]   That's all he wants. "I want to have a good time, this good time." That's the thing that matters.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.400]   Not truth, not morality, not the uplift. Good time, that's what we want. Get rid of troubles
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.480]   and problems so that we can all drink as much as well as I can, indulge sex as much as well. That's
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.040]   a good time. And that's all he wants. You see, he's got no other ideas. He never rises beyond,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:57.840]   "Ah, but not so the Christian." He doesn't live for himself, neither does he live for this world,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   because, you see, he's now looking at things in this entirely new way.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.440]   Having seen that this is only a preparatory world and a preparatory state,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.880]   and that this brief life of ours, three-score years and ten, little more or less, what is it,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.040]   a thousand years in God's sight, but one day and one day is a thousand years, oh, it's a very
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:30.160]   fleeting existence. Ah, yes, but it's one that leads on to something which is eternal and everlasting
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:39.360]   and endless. That's the real. Very well, says this man. As my eternal destiny depends upon what I do
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.960]   here, I've got a view of this life in a new way. I don't settle down in this. I don't pin all my
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.800]   hopes to this. I don't say, "Ah, now then, here it is. I'm making the maximum." No, no. I put it into
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:07.120]   that context, that other context. And not only that, I realize that this Son of God, this Lord
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:14.480]   Jesus Christ has come into this world to deliver me from it and its serfdom and its thraldom and
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:22.000]   its doom and its final destruction. He came into it and he died for me. He came and went to the
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   cross that I might be delivered from all debt and have that eternal life in the future. Very well,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   says this man. This is my argument, that they that live should not henceforth live unto themselves,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:42.640]   but unto him that died for them and rose again. Ah, says this man, what I'm out for now is not
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.600]   a good time, not just to enjoy myself, not just to try to make this world perfect so that I can
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:55.520]   stay here as long as I can. No, no. I'm concerned now to live to the glory of this Lord, this Son of
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.200]   God, who came into the world and died for me, that I might be rescued and might have the hope
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:07.040]   of that glory that's coming, not unto ourselves, but unto him that died for them and rose again,
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:14.080]   to please him, to make him known. My business tonight is not to rush out into the world and
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:20.880]   try and do things that the great statesmen can't do. Oh no, my job, my task, my calling is an
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.240]   infinitely bigger and greater one. It isn't to save men's bodies, it's to save their souls.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.280]   It's to tell them about this Lord of glory who came into the world in order to save us from
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:37.520]   its ultimate doom and to tell us that it's possible, not unto themselves, but unto him
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:46.560]   that died for them and rose again. In other words, the Christian is a man who uses this
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:53.360]   life to prepare for the next. Here it is at the previous chapter, our light affliction,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:02.480]   which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.720]   Now, here is the typical Christian view, and it's absolutely essential if we want to have
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.160]   this confidence that will enable us to face the end and say, "We know, we are always confident,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:18.800]   we are full of courage. Come what may, let the end come." It doesn't matter. This is the way.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.280]   You've got to view life in this way. It's a new way, it's revolutionary. The world says,
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.840]   "Ah, but you're an escapist." No, I'm not. I'm living in this world, I'm doing my duty in this
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.920]   world, I'm doing everything I can in this world, but I don't live for it, I'm not bounded by it,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.360]   I'm not shut in by it, it isn't to me the only world, my hopes are not in this. I use this to
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.600]   the glory of God, to make Christ known and to prepare myself for the life which is to come.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:53.280]   Now, that's how the Christian views his life in this world. So you don't say, "You see,
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.160]   can't these bombs be stopped so that I can go on having a good time? Why should these men have
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.000]   these international crises one after another and spoil my spot and my fun?" My dear friend,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.960]   how utterly superficial it all is. You know, even if there were not a war, life would still be a
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.080]   place of troubles and of problems. Even when the Victorians thought that there'd never be another
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:21.200]   war, the Pax Britannica, was life a pleasant and an enjoyable thing? No, it was still a place of
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   groaning and being burdened. Read the biographies, read the histories, there was still trouble,
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.720]   there was still drunkenness and squalor and vice and evil. The world has always been like this,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:39.840]   ever since men fell. So it is essential, you see, that we should be clear about these things.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:49.440]   Understand why life is as it is. Get this new view of life. See it for what it is,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.840]   temporary, passing, evanescent, leading to something big and great and eternal.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:04.720]   Then finally it comes to this. The Christian is a man who has absolute certainty
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:17.600]   about his eternal future. Now you notice what the letter's in. Rather nebulous, rather nebulous.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.880]   Well of course, to that poor man it is rather nebulous. It's surprising that it is even as
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:35.040]   much as that. But the answer to the charge of rather nebulous is this. We know, we know that
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.960]   if our earthly house of this stubbornness will be dissolved. Let me remind you again, it isn't a man
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.320]   on holiday who says that. It is a man in prison. It is a man who may be killed at any moment,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.200]   is in the hands of a wicked emperor called Nero, who is always changing and fitful and capricious.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.720]   He may suddenly decide in a drunken fit to kill this man of God and he knows that.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   Never was a man's life more precarious, but looking into the face of death,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:07.200]   he doesn't got a rather nebulous hope. He says, we know. Listen to him as he goes on repeating it.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.920]   Therefore we are always confident, full of courage, knowing that whilst we are at home in
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.800]   the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:26.480]   from the body and to be present with the Lord. Wherefore we labour that whether present or absent
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.800]   we may be accepted of him. He's not sitting in a corner doing nothing. He's laboring. He's doing
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.560]   his work. He's getting on with it. He hasn't gone out of life now. No, he labors. Whether present
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.920]   or absent, that's not a big thing to him, but it's everything to the other man. Is the world
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.800]   going to end? Have we only got six months? What can we do? Well, let's forget it all. Let's jump
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:52.000]   into pleasure. No, no, says the apostle. I know. I know whom I have believed. I am persuaded that
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.800]   neither death nor... It's all here. It's ever the same thing. Now then, the question before us is
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:03.520]   this. What is this faith of his? How does he know all this? How can he be so confident?
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.440]   Well, I can't answer that question fully. I'll give you some headings to work out for yourselves.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:17.040]   What's his confidence based on? Well, it isn't sight, he says. We walk by faith, not by sight.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   Now, that's the whole essence of the Christian position. But what is this faith? Well, it's
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.840]   this, you see. This is what it rests upon. The truth that you have in this book is enough in
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:34.160]   and of itself. Yours is the only book, as I say, that understands life. The only book that really
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:42.720]   understands man. Yours is the only truth about ourselves and the whole state of the world
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.480]   tonight. That ought to be enough to make you believe it. My faith is based partly upon this
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.440]   book in and of itself. But I've got more. There is a plan of God for this world. It's outlined
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:01.840]   in this book. You see it in the Old Testament. God has given various promises. Yes, and this
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.440]   book is a record of the fulfillment of the promises. Now, you take the whole story of the Jews,
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.000]   how they ever came into being and what happened to them. Can you explain all that apart from God?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.120]   Of course you can't. Take this striking momentous fact. About 800 years before the time,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.680]   God gave a message to the prophets telling them that he was going to send a great deliverer into
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.600]   this world. He told one of them that he was to be born in a little place called Bethlehem.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.200]   He told another that he was to be born of a virgin. He told many of them that he was to be
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.800]   born in great poverty. He gave an account of his life, his working of miracles, his lowliness,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.120]   all these things. And then he went on to say about his death that he'd be led like a lamb to
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.280]   the slaughter, that he was going to be smitten, that he would die, be buried, that he'd rise again.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:03.040]   Now, all that was said 800 years before the time. And then you get the fulfillment.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.720]   In other words, the faith of the Christian is based on this, not on theories, not on imagination,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:17.040]   not on fairy tales, but on the fact of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the whole world acknowledges
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.680]   this. You call this 1961 for that reason. It's 1961 years since he came. Jesus of Nazareth is
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:31.120]   the dividing point of history, the fact of Christ. My faith is based on him, the fulfillment of all
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   the promises of God. In him all the promises of God are yea and amen. He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.720]   He was born of a virgin. He was born in lowliness and poverty. He was a carpenter. He did go down
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:52.080]   into Egypt. He did work miracles. He was crucified in weakness. He did die. He was buried. He rose
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:58.240]   again. The fact of Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of the promise. This man is confident. Why?
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.640]   Well, you see, it's all here in these various phrases that he uses. Listen to it again.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:09.040]   "And that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   but unto him which died for them and rose again." How can this man, the apostle Paul,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.200]   look into the face of death and say, "If our earthly house of this tabernacle were destroyed,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.640]   we know that we have a..." What is his certainty based upon? Not only the fact of Jesus Christ,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:32.880]   but especially the fact of his resurrection, died and rose again. He'd seen him on the road
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   to Damascus. He knew it was a fact. Christ had finished dying. He had risen. All enemies had
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.160]   been conquered. The resurrection is the proof of it all. And he'd seen the risen glorified Lord,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.320]   hence his confidence. That's the basis of our confidence. And not only that, as he tells us,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:57.360]   "Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:05.040]   earnest of the Spirit." My faith is based primarily upon the facts, the historical facts concerning
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:11.760]   Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the fulfillment of all the promises of the Old Testament. Yes,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.640]   but I've got a confirmation within, the Spirit of God as an earnest. What I know and experience
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.160]   since I've believed in him, the earnest, this thing within me that testifies to it all,
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:31.600]   that makes me absolutely certain, the earnest of the Spirit, the new life that he gives us,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.520]   something we can't explain, we can't analyze, something we can't even describe. It isn't
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:43.680]   ourselves, it's what God has done to us, the earnest of the Spirit, new life in Christ Jesus.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.400]   That's it. Very well, that is the thing on which the faith and the hope are based.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:59.920]   But what is this hope? Why is it that the apostle can look like this into the face of death and be
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:11.440]   undisturbed? Here's the answer. It isn't escapism. It is the exact opposite of escapism, as a matter
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:20.640]   of fact, listen to the way in which he puts it. "Not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:29.520]   that mortality might be swallowed up of life." What does he mean? Well, he means this.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.440]   You see, the apostle didn't look at it in this way, like so many have tended to do.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:44.080]   "Ah, well, this is a world and a life of trouble, end of pain and of sorrow, a life in which we
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   groan, being burdened. The sooner the better, I'm dead. I wish I could get out of it all. I wish I
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   could have an end to it all. Why doesn't death come and take me up?" No, no. That is escapism.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:07.360]   That is the desire to be unclothed. But it wasn't the apostle's teaching.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.600]   But you know, that is the teaching of many religions.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:18.560]   That is the teaching of Buddhism and of Hinduism and many another isms.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:26.960]   But it is not the teaching of the Christian gospel, of the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:36.320]   What is this? Well, not that we be unclothed, but the exact opposite, clothed upon.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:44.240]   "In this tabernacle we do groan, being burdened. Not for that we would be unclothed,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.600]   but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:57.600]   If our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:08.240]   the building of God, a house not made with hens, eternal in the heavens." What does it mean?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:17.120]   Well, you see, it isn't a tent any longer. If our earthly house of this tabernacle, tent,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.440]   my soul at the moment is in this tent which is called my body. And it is like a tent,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.800]   it is only a temporary and a transient and a flimsy place in which to dwell.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:37.120]   If our earthly house of this tent were dissolved, our tent-like existence came to an end,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:46.160]   what have I got? Well, he says, it isn't another tent, but it's a building, a building of God,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:54.880]   and a house not made with hens, it's eternal in the heavens. This is a moving tent,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.560]   that is a building with foundations, it's everlasting, it is eternal.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.000]   The great apostle here, of course, is but repeating
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:14.400]   what our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ himself had said. Do you remember it in John 14?
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:22.800]   "Let not your heart be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:32.160]   In my Father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:39.680]   I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:48.160]   and receive you unto myself, that where I am there ye may be also." That's it. A building,
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:56.880]   not a tent, a house, a mansion in a great building, God, not hens, but God, everlasting,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.800]   eternal in the heavens, not transient, no possibility of change, an eternal place of
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:10.640]   dwelling. That's the thing, says the apostle. What else? Well, here he is, you see, putting it like
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:18.000]   this. "Knowing that whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.920]   wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:30.160]   We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:39.920]   with the Lord." What is this? Well, here it is. The moment I go out of this tent,
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:48.320]   I go on to that building that has been prepared for me, that mansion that Christ has prepared.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:57.600]   Yes, but beyond the mansion, is the Lord Christ himself present with the Lord?
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.840]   Here he says, "In this body I am absent from the Lord, but when I go out of this tent,
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:14.080]   I go to be with the Lord, to see him, to speak to him, to look into his face."
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:20.160]   Do you remember what he said to the thief dying by his side upon the cross? "Today,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:28.800]   thou shalt be with me in paradise." That's it. Do you remember what this same apostle says
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:35.600]   in writing later to the Philippians? "To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:45.760]   What is death to him? To be with Christ, which is far better. Have a mansion, to see him, to live
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:52.080]   with him, to dwell with him, in a place where there is no sorrow, no sighing, no sin, no war,
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:46:01.680]   no trouble, no bloodshed. God shall wipe away all tears from your eyes. A land of bliss and of joy,
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:11.280]   oh yes, forever with the Lord. Amen, so let it be. Life from the dead is in that word,
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:21.520]   'tis immortality. Here in the body pent, absent from him, I roam, but nightly pitch my moving tent,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:30.240]   a day's march nearer home." That's it. No longer a tent, a building, a building of God,
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.560]   a house not made with hens, an eternal house, a way out of the sorrow and the shame and the war
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.120]   and the sighing and the bloodshed, forever with the Lord. That's it.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:53.680]   And then ultimately and beyond all that, at the end of history, when he returns into this world,
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:01.920]   for he's coming back into it, the world is not just to go on and on and on. The Son of God is
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.560]   coming back and coming back to judgment and then will be the general resurrection.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.200]   And the Christian's body, the tent he's left behind him, will be raised,
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:24.960]   renewed, glorified. He'll be given a body fit for the Spirit, which is already glorified.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:33.120]   He'll be like Christ. "There shall be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:42.480]   This old world is to be redeemed. "The earnest expectation of the creature
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:49.360]   waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God," says Paul in Romans 8. "The whole creation
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:56.160]   groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." What is it? Waiting for this renewal
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:06.000]   when the Son of God shall come? This is the Christian outlook. "My hopes are not based on
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:15.840]   this world or this life, but on the one to come. In this tabernacle we do groan, being burdened,
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:21.840]   yes, but we are children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   Christ. We are going to an inheritance, and it's an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.880]   and that fadeth not away. Let China and Russia and the whole world decide what they like.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.240]   They make no difference to this. Let the world be blown up in six months. It doesn't matter.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:46.080]   The city of God remaineth. It's a building of God. It's a house not made with hens. It's eternal
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:53.840]   in the heavens. It's everlasting. It's the glory of God, which is to descend and to revolutionize
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:00.240]   the whole cosmos. "And there shall be this new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:09.040]   That's the teaching. That's what this apostle believed. And that is why he could say,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.480]   "Yea, though our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:21.440]   we know that we have a building of God, a house not made with hens, eternal in the heavens."
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:29.760]   That's it, my friends. This is the business of clergymen. This is the business of the preacher.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.880]   I can't influence Khrushchev. I can't influence China. Neither can you. Neither can anybody else.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.400]   But thank God, they're all under the hands of God. They're only temporary. Let them do their worst.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:48.560]   Let hell be let loose. Let the devil emerge as he will, with unusual malignity. He's already defeated.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:56.160]   The Christ of God has already vanquished him. Jesus reigns, and Jesus shall reign,
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:04.240]   where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run. His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:13.840]   till moon shall wax and wane no more. Here then is the question. What do you want?
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:22.320]   What are you looking for? Are you just out for a good time?
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:31.120]   Are you just out to postpone war, end the use of these infernal bombs?
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.440]   Well, if you are, you're doomed to disappointment.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:49.200]   If you are just out for some escape mechanism, you'll never find it. Forgive the language.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:59.120]   Go out, if you like, condemning this gospel, and go and have your damned good time.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:06.960]   What better are you? What have you got? What have you had? What are the shame and the remorse that'll
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:12.480]   follow? What about the facts that are still there? What about the end of life which is coming? What
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.760]   about the judgment of God? The terror of the Lord? What about it? Can you meet it? Can you face it?
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:27.120]   Oh, the unutterable madness of this superficial, non-Christian thinking.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:39.680]   Face the facts, my friend. Be a realist for once. Inquire into origins and causes.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:47.120]   And, having seen the truth about it all and about yourself,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:55.440]   having come to see that the whole world is as it is because it's like you as you are,
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:05.040]   recognize that there is only one place of safety and of rest and of quiet and of peace,
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:11.280]   and that is to become a child of God.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:23.600]   And in his hands, knowing that his dear son has died for you, that your sins might be forgiven,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:29.680]   knowing that he's just gone ahead to prepare a place for you,
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:36.240]   to erect a mansion for you in God's building in eternity,
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:47.520]   and that he'll come again and receive you unto himself, so that when the world is destroyed
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:58.080]   in the last judgment, you will not only be safe, it will just mean that you enter into that
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   inheritance that has been prepared for you before the very foundation of the world.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:20.480]   I beseech you in Christ's temple, be ye reconciled to God. If you're not, you've got nothing.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.320]   You can use bold language and escape and have pleasure for the moment,
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.760]   but the facts remain and your doom remains.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:40.720]   I beseech you as an ambassador for Christ. That's my privilege. I'm speaking for him.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:48.320]   He taketh no delight in the death of the ungodly. I beseech you in Christ's dead,
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:58.640]   be ye reconciled to God, which means acknowledge your sin, acknowledge that the world and you
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:06.080]   yourself are as you are because of this rebellion against God. Repent, confess it all, give up
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   self-defense, cast yourself upon God's mercy, believe his message concerning his Son, that
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.800]   he did make him to be sin for you who knew no sin, that you might be made the righteousness
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:24.240]   of God in him, and then get up and no longer go on living for yourself, but unto him that died
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.760]   for you, and rose again. Prepare for the glory that is coming. It may come before you know.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.000]   If it's only six months, it means only six months before the glory begins.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:45.200]   Do you believe this? That's what it means. Be reconciled to God. It's his word. It's not mine.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:50.480]   It's not human invention. It is the revelation of God. It is the thing given by the risen Lord
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:57.200]   to this man, Paul. And I'm repeating his words. I beseech you in Christ's dead,
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:12.160]   be ye reconciled unto God. Fading is the worldling's pleasure, all his boasted, pomp,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   angel, solid joys, and lasting treasure, none. But Zion's children know. Are you a child of Zion?
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:40.000]   Do you belong to it? Well, repent and believe. Be reconciled to God, and you become immediately
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:47.920]   a citizen of God's eternal city. Amen.
