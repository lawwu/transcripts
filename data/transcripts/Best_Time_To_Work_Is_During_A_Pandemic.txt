[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.280]   why the pandemic is the best time to work and also how
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.740]   rankings for public schools public universities
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.100]   Will continue to go higher and probably outrank many of the classic elite private institutions over time
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.220]   And in this episode I have with me a special guest Sydney my wife say hello
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.400]   So first of all, I just want to talk about work because it seems like
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.280]   A lot of my friends at least from the softball league are having a really great time
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.680]   During the pandemic because they get to work from home like one guy. He's taken four
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.240]   Vacations or trips. He recently was in New York City for a week and he said oh, yeah
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.720]   I went to go see my parents and I was able to quote work and then oftentimes on Facebook
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.880]   He's talking about watching games and Giants games on you know, one o'clock to four o'clock and I'm thinking myself
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.120]   Man, I want an employer who's gonna pay me multiple six figures to go watch a Giants game
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.960]   I mean, maybe it's not a Giants game
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.160]   But maybe I'll go play tennis and take a nap and if I can make big bucks
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.600]   Why not? So what are your thoughts on that?
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.240]   My first question to you is does this friend of yours have young children?
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520]   Oh
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   Yeah, well, he doesn't have young children. He works at Facebook
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.960]   Well thing is like other friends who work at ones at Wells Fargo
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.800]   One I don't know what he does, but they seem to be having really flexible
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.840]   Lifestyles, but again, they don't have children
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   Yeah
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   That's the first thing that popped into my head because I think all of us parents during the pandemic with young children
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   Felt much differently about balancing work and child care because the pandemic changed
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.240]   Everything with preschools closing down and schools closing down and obviously a lot has reopened
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.200]   Since then but as a parent it pandemic has been hard. No, you know what?
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.440]   You're right. It's like double duty all day every day, especially if you have a day job
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.880]   You're working your day job at home
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.440]   there's very little boundaries between home life and work life and
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800]   you've got to take care of your children who are always happy to see you usually or sometimes they're screaming and
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.760]   If you're creative and you're trying to do art or write or sing or do a podcast
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   Doing a lot of things things is it's almost impossible
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.160]   We both had experiences where we've been sitting at our laptop and la la la la la here comes our son
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.900]   You know one on the days where he's not in preschool, which just started a couple weeks ago, you know, and he's like
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.360]   That's really cute and fun, you know the first couple times but then he keeps checking back in
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   As the minutes tick by our patient starts to go down and there's a point where it's like, okay
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.280]   I just gotta escape. I need to escape or work when he's sleeping because this isn't working
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Right, right. I mean so many times you and I have probably rewritten a sentence
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.200]   many many times because of interruptions and we can't record this podcast if he's at home because he's gonna come find us in the house and
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.920]   Unfortunately, unfortunately, we don't live in a mega mansion
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.200]   So we don't have the left wing and the right wing and the north wing to hide and oh
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.760]   Right
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.440]   Okay, so maybe working during the pandemic with kids is not the easiest thing. However
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   However, the great thing now is that he is back in preschool
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.640]   So we decided to pull our son from preschool in March 2020 when the lockdowns began
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.320]   And we decided you know what? He's only three years old once four years old once
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.920]   Let's just use this time and make some lemonade and spend as much time with him and homeschool him as much as possible
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.200]   since then so he just started preschool August 25th 2021 and
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.320]   So far he's been having a pretty good time. He's adjusted well
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.480]   So do you feel like you have more time to do more things?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.640]   Yeah, it's funny it's just change takes a while to get used to and now that he's in school
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.560]   My my schedule is shifted. So I'm using more time to spend with our daughter one-on-one
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.440]   because
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   When he wasn't in school, it was a lot of them
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.320]   Simultaneously, and so I didn't have as much time with her alone and I'm taking advantage of that now
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.800]   And I think she really likes it as well. So I
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.440]   Do have more time to myself when she's taking her nap in the middle of the day, which is nice
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.840]   So that's been that's been helpful
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   Okay. Well, that's really great that you're able to spend more one-on-one time with our daughter
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.520]   So am I and so what about work productivity? I
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   Still find that I do my best work at night when the kids are asleep
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.440]   Sometimes if you've gone to bed early, I'm the only one awake in the house
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.000]   That's when I do my best work and I think you're the exact opposite you do your best work
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.040]   Early in the morning when all the rest of us are asleep or busy
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.600]   So I do definitely
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.360]   use that time and
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.760]   I also get a I get more time during the day when he's in school as well, but
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.200]   ultimately my best productivity is
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.360]   late
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.560]   So early exact opposite. Yeah, I believe conquer the morning conquer the day you do something productive and awesome work
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   Whatever it is, then you can feel guilt-free for the rest of the day. Do you not believe in that philosophy?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.840]   I think that's a great philosophy. I'm just not a morning person. And so I start my
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.120]   My brain just isn't as clear in the morning. I'm busy getting him ready for school
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.240]   Our daughter wants all a lot of attention in the morning. And then at the end of the day, I'm tired, but
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.800]   If I can do something productive I can go to sleep easier
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.200]   All right, because I don't go to bed thinking I still wish I did this. I wish I did that
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.480]   I'll be like, okay. I am exhausted as heck, but I was able to
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.240]   Get this one thing done or these two things done now. I can really go to sleep and by that time I am
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.480]   Exhausted so my head hits the pillow and I'm out
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.240]   That's actually a good way to look at it to you go to sleep satisfied that you accomplished the things you wanted to accomplish, right?
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   so I want to go back to the idea that during a pandemic is the best time for
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.920]   knowledge workers people who can work from home to work and one of the
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.320]   Big benefits I think is the greater ability to side hustle when I was working in banking
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.600]   You know, I started financial summary in 2009 during the bottom of the financial crisis
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.380]   But I didn't report to my firm that I was doing this because I was thinking well
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.240]   This is my freedom of speech freedom of creativity. I'm gonna go do whatever I want
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.000]   But really if you have any kind of outside interest at work
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.520]   Or from work you need to report that and if you're making any money
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.280]   You should report it as well, and you definitely don't want any conflicts of interest. So I think it's pretty cool that
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.400]   Employees can work from home
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.840]   You know their employer doesn't really know what they're doing all day
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   which is why so many of my friends are going to ball games and taking naps and running errands and
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.360]   You can work on your side hustle, which they have no way of tracking and you can make some money and there's even a story
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.680]   Where employees some of them are taking two jobs at once?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.760]   Do you read that? I mean, it's like yeah, that's a no-brainer if you have the energy and time to do it
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.040]   I mean, maybe you will run afoul of the law
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.760]   I don't know and in one firm if they find out they'll fire you
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   but that's the risk and if you can make double the money and the reason why you can make double the money is
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.600]   probably because
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.400]   They're not working as much as they were
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   At their jobs or they can do things more efficiently right more efficiently there they don't have to commute anymore
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.720]   So they have that time save that they can put towards something more
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.360]   productive and I also would say
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.520]   Some industries are super strict on
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.040]   What you can and can't do outside of work
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.120]   like finance, right
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.800]   industries that have a lot of compliance and
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.640]   Restrictions I will say though if you do want to do a side hustle that involves being on a computer
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.760]   I highly recommend using a
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.680]   Personal computer that is not tied into your works network
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   Because there are a lot of companies out there that are logging what you're doing online
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.340]   So if you're gonna side hustle keep it on a separate device. Yeah smart separate phone
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.160]   separate laptop
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.320]   That that's actually a no-brainer because I remember when I was in finance
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.080]   They were tracking everything, you know
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.120]   They had keywords they had like a software where they had keywords where if you typed an email and that keyword pop out
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:29.440]   They would review it. Yeah, there's a lot of technology out there that corporations are utilizing and they may not tell you you may have
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.800]   No idea until you get caught. So just be aware that there is a lot of tech out there for tracking and
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.200]   If you want to do something
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:46.120]   During your scheduled work hours. That's not for work. Just do it on a separate device
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:52.600]   Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I was on a podcast recently called paychecks and balances a friend rich
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.240]   I had been on his podcast. I think three or four years ago talking about
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   One of the posts I wrote called scraping by on five hundred thousand dollars a year
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.040]   why some households have a difficult time escaping the rat race and
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.440]   the reality is I thought rich the host of the podcast was a full-time podcaster and blogger and
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.540]   He had a guest on named Roger
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:23.800]   Who I thought was a full-time, you know financial planner because he wrote a book and he also has a podcast and blog as well
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:32.320]   But it turns out both rich and Roger work at Google and they've worked at Google for seven to nine years respectively
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.560]   And I was thinking myself Wow you work at Google. So you got the best benefits
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.920]   You know, it's considered one of the best companies you're making multiple six figures and all this time. I thought
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.120]   They were just full-time solopreneurs
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.520]   so what I'm trying to say is it's possible to do both to have the comfort of a steady paycheck and
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.600]   the comfort of health care benefits or subsidies and
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.720]   401k matching and so forth and that's something we don't have
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.740]   We have no safety net and we haven't had this safety net and since you left your day job in 2015
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.920]   So without this safety net
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.520]   Frankly, I have felt a lot more pressure, especially since our kids were born in 2017 and 2019
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:24.040]   To provide an income to manage our investments to make sure they don't blow up and we lose 30% in one month
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   Like we did, you know in March 2020
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   There's been a lot more pressure on me
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.400]   To make sure things will be okay, right more people are depending on me
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.800]   Yeah, and so I was wondering since I believe one of the best times to go to work is during a pandemic
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.960]   What are your thoughts about you going back to work?
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.400]   What I mean, I mean
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.600]   You are working you are working for sure. I'm working hard. We have very different roles
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.240]   I will flat-out say that we have very different roles very different skill sets and
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.680]   I think we're we're doing a pretty good job
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.480]   utilizing our individual strengths, and I think that's what
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.360]   Everyone should try to whether you're in a relationship or not
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:20.640]   Utilize your strengths because you're gonna have way more productivity, right? So are you saying that?
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   You don't want to go to a full-time job
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   Even though it's much more flexible now. It's just not worth it for me
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.280]   in my current state of mind, I don't feel like I can handle it because I
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.240]   Already have enough guilt as a mom. I feel like I'm not doing enough for our kids and
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.920]   I'm I
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.120]   Don't want to say struggling, but I'm I'm busy working on back-end stuff for
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.440]   for the blog for you know, the administrative stuff and
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.120]   I have I feel like I have a full plate and I'm I will say I am trying to be more involved in writing
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   I've got stuff in the queue that
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   Interesting stuff that I've been researching and learning about as well as sharing my own experiences. I have some upcoming articles on
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:19.920]   Ambulance surprise bills and how the whole EMS system is way more complicated and broken than I ever
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.400]   Understood before this whole experience happened. So I feel like
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:32.960]   Right, so one of the things you know, you know, I wrote I wrote about this before as a father as a new father was
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.200]   I'm thinking about taking a vacation from parenthood by going back to work
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.480]   so I think there's a chance that you might feel less stressed if you go back to work full-time because
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:52.080]   You're away from home at least mentally because you're focused on work and you're making a steady paycheck and we've got you know
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.400]   Subsidized health care and benefits and so forth and that guilt and that stress of the homework
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.040]   Would be greatly reduced. What are your thoughts about that? I
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:10.560]   Know myself pretty well, and I don't see that happening. I just see my my mental health
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.080]   Further and
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.000]   feeling more chaotic more disorganized
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.080]   More I feel like my mental
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.000]   Explode
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.240]   Because a lot of the work that I'm doing can't just go away right it has to keep going
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.320]   There's there's just all these tasks that I need to do on the back end
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.360]   and
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.560]   Maintain it's just an ongoing thing, which is fine
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.920]   And I love doing it and I also love having the time
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.680]   to do more writing and editing being more involved in that as well and I
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.840]   I just know
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.520]   Yeah
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.880]   Maybe it's the grass is greener on the other side syndrome that I'm feeling right now when I see friends just
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:11.000]   Really flexible work hours side hustling and you have to remind yourself if those people
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:19.440]   If they don't it's a very different right, okay, so I got it I know what the solution is
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.800]   When both our children are in school full-time
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.760]   You'll go back to work full-time
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.480]   Okay, I might go back to work full-time because oh here's one of the things that I'm really
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:43.920]   Surprised about ever since our son started going to preschool. So I got a drive, you know during rush hour 830
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.240]   A.m. I got to send him to school. So that takes
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.000]   Up to 20 minutes to get to school and then I got a park and I gotta walk him and give him a hug and
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.480]   All that because I love that but the driving I don't like
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.920]   It's crazy in San Francisco and I feel like now that I'm commuting during rush hour
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.840]   I feel like I'm mentally going back to work and the commute itself is the worst thing
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.700]   Was the worst thing I hated about work just commuting. It just it's terrible, right?
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.600]   and then so I go there and then I come back home and
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.960]   Then around 3 or 5 I go there not as much traffic. So it's only taking 15 minutes
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.220]   You know, I park we go walk around and then I come back home
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.160]   So that in total is about an hour and 20 minutes
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.760]   Now the other day I decided to go play tennis with a friend of mine at 4 45 p.m
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:44.040]   So I went to school dropped him off came back. I went to school pick him up came back
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.880]   You know just hung out for like 20 minutes and then I went back out to go play tennis
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   Which is like a 16 17 minute drive
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.940]   So in other words, I was almost on the road for two hours the other day
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.620]   And I was thinking of myself. This is so inefficient. Like this is the inefficiency that I
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:06.960]   Long to escape that I've appreciated since 2012. And so if I took a full-time job I could
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.640]   You know drop them off by 9 a.m
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.480]   And then continue on for another 5 to 7 minutes to downtown office
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:22.300]   You know just twiddle my thumbs at the water cooler make some money tell people what to do and then leave at around
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.160]   215 310 pick them up and then come back. It would just feel much more efficient
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.920]   Perhaps perhaps it just depends
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:39.420]   What happens during those work hours and what happens outside of that day that still involves work, right?
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.420]   Because I know a lot of times
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.320]   You might have to do work for that job
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.880]   at home
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   You know, it's just hard to say it just depends on the jobs demands
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.320]   but so one of the psychological benefits of
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:02.960]   Generating enough passive income to pay for our living expenses is that you don't you're not all in on work
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.520]   Right that that promotion you didn't get or that pay raise you didn't get
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.640]   Doesn't crush you as much if you've already if you're already financially stable
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.120]   so my thought process and I and I felt that when I did some consulting back in 2014 2015 is that
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.360]   You know what annoying co-workers are annoying, but I don't really care
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.200]   I'm not competing with them to you know, climb the ladder or whatever
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:32.880]   Just give me something interesting to do have fun people to talk to make some money and then pick up our son and then go
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.920]   Home, so do you think I would enjoy that? I
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.200]   think you I could see you enjoying that for a
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.880]   few months and then I could see it getting old and frustrating because
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Jobs come with stress
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.400]   Dealing with people is
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.040]   often
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.400]   Frustrating right? Okay. Well in conclusion, it looks like I am unable to convince you to go back to work
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.880]   This is like the fifth year in a row running. I
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.280]   Sorry, you are
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.160]   But I'm talking. No, no, you are working very hard
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   but I'm talking about traditional work where you bring home the bacon and
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.240]   You know, let me
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.400]   Relax a little more
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.680]   Okay, so I failed in that however, I am working more on our business
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.540]   Okay good and new ways with with producing more articles
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.680]   Which you got you readers will and we're doing this podcast, which is which is great. Yeah, okay
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   So but anyway, I failed that tradition
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.880]   Convincing you to traditionally go back to work. I
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.800]   Have also kind of failed in convincing myself now is the ideal time to go back to work
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.000]   But I'd love to hear from all of you guys, especially with
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.360]   People with kids who are back in school
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.800]   Do you find it better because the comments in my post a lot of people said oh, it's so much easier now better
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.720]   I only work three to four hours a day
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.540]   Whereas in the past I had to travel a lot and work ten hours a day
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:13.680]   so I'd love to hear from all of you about work during the pandemic and what am I missing and
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.000]   Maybe what are you missing?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.400]   Thanks so much. And if you enjoyed this podcast love a positive five-star review leave a comment
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.880]   We'll read them all and it drives us to keep on recording. Thanks everybody. Take care
