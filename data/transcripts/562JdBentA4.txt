[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   A listener named Joe writes in, "Hello Pastor John, I am a young complementarian man dating
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.920]   a young evangelical feminist woman.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.860]   We are considering marriage.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.680]   What do you think would be good or bad about a marriage with this dynamic?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.120]   Would this make a more accurate portrayal of how the church follows Christ, or would
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.900]   it be a heavier distraction?
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.520]   How do you think a complementarian and egalitarian marriage could work out practically, and how
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.820]   do you think the relationship would suffer?"
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:46.300]   My question, Joe, is which of you, you or your wife, future wife, will choose to sacrifice
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.400]   your conscience and with it your integrity to make the marriage work?
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.260]   There is no doubt one of you will have to sacrifice a good conscience.
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.920]   You would enter the marriage believing that it is God's will for you to fulfill the
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.180]   role of head, as you see it laid out in Ephesians 5, 22 to 33.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.900]   She would enter the marriage believing that it is God's will that you not assume a
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.460]   special role as leader or head.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.980]   You will enter the marriage believing it is God's will that your wife be subject to
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.700]   your loving leadership the way the church is subject to Christ in Ephesians 5, and she
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.340]   will enter the marriage believing that there is no such teaching in the Bible, and that
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.140]   God does not expect that of her, and it would be wrong, in fact, to say that God does.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.940]   You will enter the marriage believing that God calls you to raise your children in the
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.660]   instruction of the Lord, including his instruction that your sons should be husbands who lead
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.180]   out in marriage, and your daughters should be wives who submit gladly to their husbands,
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.980]   and she will enter the marriage believing that God calls you to raise your children
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.360]   to be egalitarians.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.620]   It is not possible, Joe, that both of you will be able to carry out your beliefs.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.340]   They contradict each other.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:41.180]   One of you will have to assume a role that your conscience dictates is wrong, and my
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.780]   question is, which of you will sacrifice your conscience and with it your integrity to make
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.900]   the marriage work?
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.100]   Martin Luther said, "To act against conscience is neither safe nor right."
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.140]   Conscience is not an infallible guide to right behavior, but even when conscience is badly
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.060]   informed, to act against it is sin.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.900]   That's what Paul meant in Romans 14.23, "Whatever is not from faith is sin."
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.580]   The solution to a badly informed conscience is not to go against it, but to transform
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.320]   it with biblical truth.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:30.580]   So even if your wife decided to conform to your expectations, she would be sinning.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.620]   If she still believed in her heart that she was right about egalitarianism and you were
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.620]   wrong.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.260]   Now, there are many things husbands and wives can disagree about and still have a biblically
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.600]   sound and godly and even joyful marriage.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.300]   But in matters of biblically informed conscience that affect the dynamic of the relationship
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.180]   at every turn, disagreement of that sort is unworkable.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180]   Someone has to give in.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.260]   Someone has to go against conscience and belief.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.860]   Giving in on our color preferences for the carpet or giving in on how many guests should
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.660]   come over for dinner is not a sin.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.060]   It's a way good marriages work.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.540]   But giving in when your position is a biblical conviction and a matter of conscience, that's
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.020]   not what Christians do.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.860]   That's a sin.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.040]   So in my judgment, walking into a marriage with this level of disagreement about your
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   respective roles would be walking into a relationship that it is a sin to leave and in which someone
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.100]   must sin to make it work.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.620]   I want to underscore that last point that you made.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.900]   It would be a sin to leave the marriage, thus guarding couples in this very situation from
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.460]   thinking that this answer to Joe can be used as a basis for dissolving their own marriage
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.060]   through divorce.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.060]   Not so.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.060]   Thank you, Pastor John.
