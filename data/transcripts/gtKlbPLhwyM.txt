[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   You might have heard that carrying your phone in your pocket
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.460]   can reduce your testosterone levels and sperm count,
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.480]   and guess what?
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.320]   That is true.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.240]   The data contained within this meta-analysis
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   and other meta-analyses clearly point out
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.040]   that it can reduce sperm count
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160]   and maybe testosterone levels significantly,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   but certainly sperm count and motility significantly.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.920]   It reduces sperm quality.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   So should you avoid putting your phone in your pocket?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.280]   Certainly your front pocket, I would suggest yes, right?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.960]   If you are somebody who is seeking to conceive, right?
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.940]   And then people say,
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.600]   well, I don't actually feel the heat of the phone.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.180]   It doesn't get that warm.
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.120]   But the temperature effects of the phone, it turns out,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.260]   are enough, even under conditions
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.280]   in which people don't report it to be uncomfortably warm,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.840]   that it can change the temperature milieu of the testicle
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.400]   in ways that can diminish sperm quality.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.280]   How much and how that relates
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.600]   to fertility and healthy pregnancy, not clear.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.080]   But since we're talking about things to avoid,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.640]   if your goal is to have a healthy fertilization
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.560]   in pregnancy, well then, by all means,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   just don't carry it in your front pocket.
