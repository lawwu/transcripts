[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.760]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.840]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.580]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.440]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.620]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.720]   to bring you zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.540]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.740]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.460]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.100]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.600]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.320]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.760]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.940]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood tests.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.660]   And the simple reason for that
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.080]   is that so many of the factors that impact our immediate
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.920]   and long-term health and wellbeing
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.200]   can only be analyzed from blood.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.540]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.780]   you can get additional layers of information
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.460]   that can really support your understanding
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.460]   about what's going on deep under the hood, so to speak,
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.620]   inside your body and brain and what to do about it.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.240]   And I think that's really where Inside Tracker
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.660]   sets itself apart from other similar tests.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.300]   What Inside Tracker offers is, first of all,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.860]   they make the tests very easy.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.200]   They can come to your home to take your blood and DNA test,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.260]   or you can go to a testing center nearby you.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.840]   Then you get the information back,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.640]   and rather than just getting information
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.520]   about whether or not the levels of various things
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.220]   are high or low,
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.200]   you also get to find out what to do about it.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.840]   So it offers directives related to nutrition,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.120]   to exercise and so forth.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.080]   It really allow you to be in control of your overall health,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.800]   both where you are now and its long-term trajectory.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.920]   With Inside Tracker, they also have something
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.600]   which is it can give you a readout of your inner age.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.200]   They have something called the inner age test
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.440]   that really compares your biological age
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.620]   to your chronological age,
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.840]   something that's of extreme importance and interest
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.320]   because it has to do with lifespan or predicted lifespan.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.800]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.600]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.

[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280]   Helix Sleep is a company that makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.760]   ideally suited to your sleep needs.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.400]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.600]   for the last six months.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.800]   And I can honestly say it's the best sleep
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.360]   that I've ever gotten.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.440]   Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.840]   to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080]   It's a quiz that takes just about two minutes,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.600]   ask you questions like do you tend to sleep on your side
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   or your back, on your stomach, or maybe you don't know
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   whether or not you tend to wake up feeling too warm
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.400]   or too cold, various questions about your sleep habits.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.960]   At the end of that quiz, it matches you
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.160]   to a specific mattress that's perfect for your sleep needs.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.220]   For me, it matched me to the DUSK, D-U-S-K,
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.600]   because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   nor too soft.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.200]   And I really love the mattress.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.340]   As I mentioned, I've been sleeping terrifically well
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.280]   ever since I got that mattress.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.980]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.580]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.040]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.960]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.180]   and then you'll get up to $200 off all mattresses
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.580]   and you'll get two free pillows.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.920]   They have a 10-year warranty.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.360]   You get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.440]   If you don't like it, they'll even pick it up for free,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.800]   take it away, but I really think you will.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120]   I certainly love mine.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.380]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.620]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.660]   that releases deep muscle tension.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.820]   I first learned about Theragun on a lab expedition.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.780]   We were actually headed out to Ocean
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.320]   where we were doing diving with great white sharks,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.240]   filming those for our VR fear experiments in the laboratory,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.720]   and it was very long days of carrying Pelican cases.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.080]   Those are cases, these hard plastic cases with equipment.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   It was diving.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.960]   We were all sore and tired all the time,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   and someone had brought along a Theragun.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.560]   It was the first time I had seen one,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.440]   and pretty soon that thing was getting passed along
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.120]   and became one of the more coveted devices on board.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.020]   Everyone wanted time with this thing because it was great.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.000]   You could give yourself a really terrific massage
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.760]   and get deep into the tissue and relieve soreness.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   When I got back, I got a Theragun,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.740]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.960]   Whether or not you want to treat your muscles
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.480]   because they're tense from working out
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.060]   or whether or not you just want to release stress,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.800]   it's a terrific tool.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.020]   Many of you are familiar probably with professional massages,
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.720]   but a Theragun is interesting
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.920]   because you can basically give yourself
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.560]   a deep tissue massage anytime, anywhere.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.240]   It's also very quiet.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.040]   If you want to try Theragun, you can try it for 30 days.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.200]   They start at only $199.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   You can go to theragun.com/huberman right now,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   and you can get your Gen 4 Theragun today.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.880]   That's the one that I use or another one of their models.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.600]   That's theragun.com/huberman to try Theragun.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.440]   This episode marks the beginning of a new topic
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.800]   for the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   As many of you already know,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.360]   we go deep into a particular topic over four,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.380]   sometimes even five episodes.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.280]   We just closed out the episodes on hormones.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.760]   Now we are going to talk about
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.700]   how to optimize physical performance and skill learning.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.080]   We're going to look deep at the science behind this
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.520]   as well as specific practices.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   In fact, today, you're going to hear about specific tools
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   that you can use to improve endurance and strength
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.160]   by up to, I'm not making this up,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.200]   three or four times your current capacity.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.720]   This is based on studies that were done at Stanford
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.160]   and are currently in use
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   by collegiate and professional teams.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.420]   If you're not a professional athlete or a serious athlete,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.260]   that's okay.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.320]   The topics this month
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.280]   and all the information we are going to cover
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.080]   are going to make you a better recreational exerciser
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.660]   as well.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.920]   If you're not an exerciser
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.360]   and you're thinking about getting into that,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.060]   or if you live in the Northern hemisphere
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.560]   and you're just thinking about the beach this summer,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.640]   fat loss, muscle building, that sort of thing,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.360]   this month, we're going to cover all of that as well.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.100]   There's so much confusion out there
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.180]   about how to optimize fat loss, muscle building,
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.280]   improvements in flexibility, for instance,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.400]   or skill learning.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.080]   I know many of you aren't so focused
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.200]   on the cosmetic aspects of physical exercise,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.380]   but are interested in actual skill learning.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.120]   We're going to talk about that too.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.700]   I want to just take a moment
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.560]   to reflect on something that came up last episode.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.320]   If you didn't see that episode, that's quite all right.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.180]   But last episode,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.120]   we were talking about the hormones adrenaline and cortisol
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   and how to leverage those towards attention and learning.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.380]   And there was a little bit of confusion
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.800]   that I want to clarify.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.340]   I mentioned an optimal protocol for learning
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.560]   that involved leveraging adrenaline,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.000]   also called epinephrine.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.300]   And it involved four steps.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.340]   The four steps that I spelled out
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.960]   were to be calm and focused
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.680]   while one is trying to acquire or learn the new skill,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.480]   cognitive skill or motor skill.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   Then to have a spike in adrenaline,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.040]   I mentioned ways to do that,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.020]   using cold or breathing or other tools.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.700]   Immediately after the learning episode,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.040]   then to incorporate what I call non-sleep deep rest,
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.800]   a 20 minute episode of a shallow nap
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.440]   or some other protocol like NSDR,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.160]   non-sleep deep rest protocol,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.080]   of which we always provide links in the captions.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.320]   And then to try and optimize sleep later that night
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.780]   and the subsequent night.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.400]   Some of you heard this and it sunk in right away
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.600]   and it was straightforward.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.280]   Others said, wait, I thought from a previous episode,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   even before that,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.920]   you said you're supposed to do non-sleep deep rest
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.080]   immediately after learning.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.440]   No, we added another step.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.880]   The logic still follows
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.040]   that you want to be calm and focused during learning.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.960]   Then you want to spike adrenaline at the end.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   Most people get that backward.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.620]   They're drinking too much coffee
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.240]   or even taking nootropics and things,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.140]   trying to be really focused while learning.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.660]   Some people are taking Adderall recreationally,
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.040]   something I don't recommend.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.160]   That's actually getting the whole process backwards
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   if you look at the data and the physiology.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.320]   You want to spike adrenaline at the end
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.060]   or immediately after a learning episode
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.400]   and then non-sleep deep rest and then sleep itself.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.420]   Okay, four steps.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.000]   Hope that clarifies things for you.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.360]   If you have any additional questions,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.640]   please put them in the comment section below.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.900]   Okay, so let's talk about physical performance.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.920]   There are so many variables to physical performance
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.680]   and we can manage physical performance and skill learning
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.840]   from a variety of contexts.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.600]   I made just a short list of some of the things
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.920]   that come to mind that can powerfully impact
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.240]   physical performance and skill learning.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.160]   Some of them are what I would consider foundational.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.720]   They allow you to show up with your current ability.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   And if you were to disrupt those,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.540]   you would perform less well.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.360]   So things like getting a good night's sleep,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   things like being properly hydrated,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.060]   things like being well-nourished,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.180]   whatever that means to you.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.120]   I know some of you like to exercise fasted.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.640]   Some of you prefer to have food in your stomach
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.540]   or have eaten a couple hours before.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.220]   There are supplements, there are drugs,
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.740]   there are different ways to breathe.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.300]   There are so many tools related to mindset, visualization.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.900]   There are machines and devices.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.320]   It's just a vast space, but it's not infinite.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.880]   And there are a few things in the list of things
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.440]   that can impact and even optimize physical performance
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.040]   and skill learning that have an outsized effect
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.400]   that any of you can use.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   Many of them, most of them are low to zero cost.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   So today we are going to focus on what I believe
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.460]   to be one of the most powerful tools
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.700]   to improve physical performance
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.520]   and skill learning and recovery.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.400]   We'll talk about why that's important.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.540]   And that's temperature.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.780]   Now, many of you might think, oh, well, that's kind of boring.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.380]   I want to know about the magic pill that I can take
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.020]   that's going to allow me to dunk a basketball
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.080]   if I currently can't, or I want to know about the thing
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.780]   that's going to let me run further and faster,
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.200]   is going to shed fat.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.840]   Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.160]   for improving physical performance and for recovery.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.840]   I would argue it's even more important than sleep
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.880]   because temperature itself is going to dictate
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   how well and when you sleep
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.580]   and the depth of your total recovery.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.140]   There are two aspects to temperature, of course.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.780]   There's heat and there's cold.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   We are mainly going to focus on cold as a way to buffer heat.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.940]   In a previous podcast episode,
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.780]   I talked all about growth hormone.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.180]   You can find that episode about thyroid and growth hormone
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.480]   and how heat can be a powerful stimulus
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.520]   for increasing growth hormone,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.860]   which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera,
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.720]   can burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   However, cold, I would argue,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.520]   is even more powerful than heat as a tool.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.600]   And I'm not just talking about putting ice packs
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.360]   on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.780]   and things of that sort.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.180]   We're going to talk about cold
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.840]   from the standpoint of thermal physiology.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.680]   This is a literature that's rich in scientific information
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   that goes back very deep into the last century
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.560]   where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.320]   that there are different compartments in your body
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.440]   that heat and cool you differently
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.600]   and that you can leverage those in order to double,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   and as I mentioned before,
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.720]   even triple or quadruple your work output,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.840]   both strength, repetitions, and endurance.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.380]   So this is not weak sauce, as they say.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.940]   This is the stuff that can really shift the needle
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.780]   quite a bit.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.660]   And it's not just about performing well once,
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.340]   it's about being able to perform well
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.900]   and recover from that performance
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.500]   so that you do even better
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.060]   when you're not incorporating these tools
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.620]   on days where, for instance, you can't access cold
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.240]   or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.600]   So we're going to cover cold.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.120]   We're going to talk a little bit about the physiology
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.300]   of cold and heat and how they work,
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.140]   because as you've probably heard me say before,
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.220]   if you can understand some mechanism,
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.300]   if you can just push yourself
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.740]   through a little bit of new knowledge
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.460]   into understanding a little bit of mechanism
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.660]   about how you work,
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.540]   you'll be in a far better position to implement the tools
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.780]   in the best and most flexible ways for your needs.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.220]   This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.300]   I never ever do a just list of the things that you should do.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.600]   I don't believe in the just tell me what to do.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.840]   First, I tell you why you should do something,
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.200]   what's the logical framework that it's grounded in,
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.640]   and then we distill that down to specific protocols.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.300]   For those of you that are too impatient for that,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.440]   there are millions, if not billions,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.560]   of other resources out there
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.620]   that will take you into the cul-de-sac
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.680]   of one protocol that will work and then stop working
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.280]   or might work for you indefinitely.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.940]   That's not how we work here.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.580]   This is about really understanding the mechanism
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.280]   so that you can tweak things and modify things,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.520]   adjust the timing and the dosage of things,
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.120]   and really get the most out of these tools and protocols.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.400]   Everything I'm going to talk about
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.000]   pertains to both endurance exercise
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.560]   and strength and speed type exercise.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.560]   So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work,
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.100]   and to some extent flexibility,
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.040]   but we are going to cover flexibility in depth
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.360]   as well as another feature that's not often talked about,
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.280]   which is suppleness or smoothness of movement
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.920]   over different ranges of movement in a subsequent episode.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.980]   Let's start by talking about temperature.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.700]   What is temperature?
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.380]   How does temperature impact the body
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.340]   and its ability to perform, including learn new skills?
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.540]   So everyone probably remembers,
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.260]   or has at least heard of the word homeostasis, right?
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.080]   That the body wants to remain
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.720]   in a particular range of temperatures,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.640]   that it doesn't like to be too hot or too cold.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.240]   And I want to emphasize from the outset
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.080]   that there are many mechanisms that are installed into us
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   by way of our evolutionary design and our genome,
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.660]   meaning we were just born with this stuff ready
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.740]   to keep our body temperature in a particular narrow range.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.380]   Heating up too much is just plain bad.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.240]   It's not just bad for physical performance,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.660]   it's bad for all tissue health.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.980]   If your brain heats up too much,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.780]   neurons start dying and those neurons don't come back, okay?
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.460]   You may have heard about neurogenesis,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.040]   the ability for the brain to regenerate itself
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.620]   or generate new neurons in adulthood.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.380]   There's very little neurogenesis, excuse me, in adulthood,
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.880]   even any time after puberty, really.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.580]   And you don't want to lose neurons
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.900]   in the central nervous system.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.660]   If you get too hot, that'll happen.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.240]   It's called hyperthermia.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.660]   You want to avoid hyperthermia.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.980]   And you have many mechanisms that are built into you
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.820]   to avoid becoming hyperthermic.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.560]   The other thing that happens when we get too warm
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.780]   is that we have in all of our cells
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.100]   what are called enzymes.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.580]   You generally know if something's an enzyme
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.920]   because it ends in the letters A-S-E, right?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   So lipase is an enzyme that exists to digest fats.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   You have proteases that are there to digest proteins, right?
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   So anytime you see A-S-E, chances are it's an enzyme.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.120]   Enzymes are proteins and they have a particular structure
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:46.100]   and their structure becomes modified when heat increases.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.460]   And that's not good.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   You want their structure to be of a particular type.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.580]   Imagine a car with four wheels.
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.020]   Let's just say the car is the enzyme.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.460]   If it gets too hot, it's like two of the wheels fall off
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.860]   and that thing can't function.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.980]   So one of the reasons why the body and nature
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.780]   goes through so much effort to build in mechanisms
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.940]   to make sure that we don't become too warm
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.860]   is because when we get too warm, these enzymes don't function
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.460]   cells stop functioning.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.720]   They stop being able to generate energy.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.380]   They stop being able to digest things.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.260]   You stop being able to think
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.460]   and eventually those cells start dying off entirely.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.600]   So keeping temperature in a particular range is really good.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.460]   You don't want to get too hot.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.780]   We have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.060]   Now you don't want to become hypothermic either.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.460]   You can die from hypothermia
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.140]   just like you can die from hyperthermia.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.140]   However, that you have a lot more range to be cold
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.780]   than you do to be too warm, okay?
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.620]   And in general, the idea is to keep the body and brain
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.900]   in a particular range, but anytime we do anything,
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.840]   our body temperature can shift.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.000]   So for instance, if you were to stand next to a campfire
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.060]   or you were outside on a hot day,
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.960]   various things would happen to dump heat from your body.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.580]   If you were outside on a cold day
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.720]   or you were to get into a cold shower or a cold lake,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.820]   various things would happen
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.380]   to insulate heat within your body.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.020]   This is all pretty straightforward and obvious I realize.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.620]   Now, what are those things?
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.180]   Well, there are a huge category of them.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.980]   When you get into cold water, you secrete adrenaline.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.200]   On a hot day, if it's really hot or in a very hot sauna
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.700]   or in the hot desert, you will generate
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.460]   what are called heat shock proteins
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.520]   which will set off other sets of cascades,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.240]   metabolic cascades, biological cascades.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.380]   But the simplest way to think about this process
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.300]   is that when we get cold, we tend to vasoconstrict.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.640]   Our blood vessels tend to constrict
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.120]   and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280]   to preserve our core organs, okay?
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.100]   So our periphery, our hands and our feet and our toes
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.620]   and our legs become colder and our core therefore
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   can maintain blood to that area
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.540]   and we are insulating our core.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.760]   Conversely, when we heat up, our blood vessels vasodilate.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.020]   They expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.220]   and more blood can move throughout the body generally
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.560]   and we will perspire, we will sweat.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.020]   Water will actually get pulled out of the blood
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.620]   to some extent, moved up through sweat glands
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.180]   and will be brought to the skin surface
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.780]   so that it can be dumped.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.820]   We are dumping heat.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.600]   Animals, as you know, vary in their capacity to sweat.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.340]   Some animals like camels won't start sweating at first.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.540]   If they heat up, what they'll do is they'll spit.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.220]   They'll dump heat by spitting, okay?
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.300]   Dogs pant, Costello is off to my left here.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.860]   He pants when he gets too warm, he can't sweat
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.680]   or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.660]   But we can sweat and you've probably noticed
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.320]   that on a humid hot day, you'll feel much warmer
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.800]   just walking or running than you would
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.560]   with the equivalent exercise or movement
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.060]   that you would on a cold day.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.360]   And some of you probably know this, but if you don't,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.300]   the reason is you sweat on a cold day,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.660]   but because the air is dry typically,
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.780]   you will bring that sweat to the surface
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.780]   and provided you're wearing clothes
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.700]   that allow some air to get out away from the body.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.500]   So you're not wearing really tight spandex type clothing
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   or something like that,
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.800]   or seal type saran wrap type clothing,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.420]   that sweat will evaporate off into the dry atmosphere.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.140]   Whereas on a humid day, the reason you see people
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.660]   in New York and Florida on a humid summer day
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.380]   and they're like moving their shirts off themselves
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.100]   and you see people with big sweat stains
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.300]   and back sweat stains and all this kind of stuff
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.460]   is because they're sweating as they normally would,
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.900]   but it's humid and so the humidity of the air
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.000]   doesn't allow transfer of that sweat
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.640]   into the atmosphere as readily and so you're hot, okay?
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.460]   So without the evaporation, you're going to be warmer.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.400]   So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.700]   and we vasodilate when we want to dump heat.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.260]   When we want to maintain heat,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.600]   we vasoconstrict and we tend to not sweat.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.480]   The other thing that happens is you'll get goosebumps,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.960]   so-called goose pimples, they're sometimes called.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.820]   Those are a throwback to the time where we had fur
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.760]   over most, not all of our body.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   All mammals in the cold have a process whereby adrenaline
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.560]   is released at low levels, typically, into the body.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.600]   That adrenaline activates what are called sympathetic fibers.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.280]   They have nothing to do with sympathy.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.380]   Those little fibers, which are neurons,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.820]   those fibers that, what I'm saying are fibers are neurons,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.420]   not clothing fibers, reach up into the skin.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.940]   So your whole body is covered with these little tiny neurons
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.780]   that reach up into the skin and when we are cold,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.860]   they actually mechanically take the hair follicle
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.140]   and bend it up.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:05.140]   It's a process called piloerection, P-I-L-O, erection, okay?
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.520]   So on a hot day, you want to dump heat, okay?
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.920]   So on a hot day, what would happen is
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.440]   you'd actually not see those goose pimples
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.460]   because you want the hairs lying down,
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.820]   which actually you would think that might insulate you more,
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.780]   but would actually let more heat dissipate
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.340]   out through the skin.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.620]   On a cold day, you get these goose pimples or goosebumps,
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.860]   which are really just an ancient carry over
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.020]   from the body's attempt to make hair stand up on end.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.180]   And when hair step stand up on end
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.140]   and they're very close together,
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.900]   that traps air in between them
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.540]   and actually creates a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.540]   If you've ever seen an animal like a malamute or a husky,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.280]   you might think, oh, that poor thing on a hot day,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.100]   what does it do with all that hair?
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.900]   Well, it can be warm, so the animal will typically pant
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.780]   and its hair will lay down,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.980]   which you might think would act as more of a blanket,
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.160]   but on a cold day, what'll happen is
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.800]   they'll become very puffy.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   Their hair will stand up on end
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.620]   and that's actually trapping heat between the hairs
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.640]   and they're actually quite well insulated.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.260]   So it's very important that if you want to understand
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.520]   how you can leverage temperature for physical performance,
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.160]   you have to understand that you have vasoconstriction
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.540]   to conserve heat, vasodilation to dump heat,
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.200]   that you have sweating to dump heat
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.680]   and you have conservation of fluids
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.480]   in order to preserve heat.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.480]   That's the most important thing
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.460]   in terms of understanding the mechanisms
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.360]   of maintaining and dumping heat.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.440]   And now the most important thing to understand is that
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.980]   if you get too hot,
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.480]   not only do those enzymes stop working,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.200]   but your ability to contract your muscles stops, okay?
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.960]   I'm going to repeat this because it's vitally important.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.560]   ATP is involved in the process
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.280]   of generating muscle contractions.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.920]   Doesn't matter if you're running a marathon,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.480]   doesn't matter if you're doing a yoga class,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.200]   doesn't matter if you're going for a 700 pound squat.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.940]   The range of temperatures within which ATP can function
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.880]   and muscles can contract is very narrow.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.600]   Somewhere around 39 or 40 degrees Celsius,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.760]   it drops off and you will not be able
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.260]   to generate more contractions.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.300]   Now that's pretty hot,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.080]   but that temperature can be generated locally really fast.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   Now, if you're too cold, it's true,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.600]   it's hard to generate muscle contractions.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.400]   I got into doing some cold water swimming a little while ago
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.460]   and we would joke that you come out of the water,
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.200]   we do no wetsuits.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.040]   I'm not recommending people do this necessarily
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.620]   unless you're certainly with somebody else
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.740]   who's skilled at doing it, which I was.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.240]   And you come out and you feel like you have claws for hands.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.220]   You could never text on a phone for the first few minutes.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.180]   I mean, the water was very, very cold
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.660]   and you can't even move your face.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.800]   And so muscles will become rigid,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.460]   but heating up muscles causes them to fail
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.360]   to be able to generate more contractions.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   Put simply, if you get too hot, you stop exercising.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.720]   You may not even realize it,
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.360]   but your will to exercise further,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   your ability to push harder
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.860]   is entirely dependent on the heat of the muscle,
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.740]   both locally and your whole system.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.300]   So let's talk about your whole system
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.080]   because I just described heat dumping and heat maintaining.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.680]   I told you that increasing heat
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.720]   makes it hard for muscles to contract.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.600]   It will stop you from being able to run further and faster.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   It will stop you from being able to lift more weights,
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.500]   more sets, more repetitions.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.760]   If you can keep temperature in range, however,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.800]   in a proper range, you will be able to do more work.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.540]   You will be able to create greater output.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.140]   You'll be able to lift more weight, more sets, more reps,
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.540]   and you'll be able to run further.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.440]   Now, there are data that I'm going to talk about
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.880]   in a little bit that are absolutely striking
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.160]   that underscore that statement.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.200]   There are data from my colleague, Craig Heller's lab
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.280]   in the Department of Biology at Stanford.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   And there are data that are now being implemented.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.140]   They were first implemented in a grant funded by DARPA,
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.100]   but now in professional sports teams.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.540]   Many, if not all the NFL teams
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.700]   are now using this technology as well as military uses it.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.520]   And not just for sports performance,
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.360]   but also firefighters, construction workers,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.680]   other professions where elevated heat
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.620]   becomes a barrier to performance.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.880]   And you can leverage this to really improve your workouts.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.020]   And when I say really improve, it is striking.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.600]   I'm going to give away a little hint of this now,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.440]   and then I'm going to tell you
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.720]   a little bit more of the data later
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.320]   after I tell you the protocols.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.660]   Proper cooling of the body,
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.500]   which has to be done in a very specific way,
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.040]   has allowed recreational athletes or college students
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.100]   and typical adults, as well as professional athletes
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.260]   to go from doing their usual output.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.360]   In this case, what comes to mind best
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.680]   would be a particular professional athlete,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.080]   he's a member of the 49ers at the time,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   was able to do 40 dips on his first set, 30, 20, 20,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.820]   basically did 10 sets of dips unassisted with anything else.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.160]   That's an impressive,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.880]   especially since he's a really large guy.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.420]   40 dips is respectable.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.680]   These are strict full range dips.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.120]   And then by the 10 set, there's a steep drop-off.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.640]   Using proper cooling of particular body compartments,
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.260]   he was able to triple that within less than a week
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.320]   and maintain that performance
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.780]   even without the cooling approach.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.860]   So it was actually a conditioning effect, all right?
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.400]   I'll get back to this in a little bit,
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.360]   but there are other fantastic leaps of effort
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.800]   and leaps of performance that were demonstrated,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.580]   including endurance running.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.360]   Before I continue any further,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.000]   I just want to underscore again that overheating is terrible.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.460]   There's a famous example of this.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.460]   This was about 10, 15 years ago
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.620]   when a number of dietary supplements
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.740]   that included things like epinephrine, which is a stimulant,
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.800]   it's a beta adrenergic stimulant,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.320]   drugs like clambuterol,
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.340]   which were then banned from the Olympics,
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.400]   which are still out there a bit in recreational use,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.880]   which were beta adrenergic agonists.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.760]   So these are drugs that sort of mimic
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.780]   epinephrine adrenaline to some extent.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.360]   I know I'm oversimplifying this here.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.560]   They improve fat loss because of the effects on metabolism,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.180]   but they heat up the body.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.680]   And what happened was this hit the press very widely
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.720]   is high school football players
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.840]   and various professional athletes were dropping dead
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.800]   because they were overheating
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.840]   during practice or in competition.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.720]   So much so that clambuterol was banned,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.640]   although every once in a while,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.680]   somebody gets in trouble for using this.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.020]   There was an instance of this recently
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.040]   in professional boxing,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.160]   which was attributed to a bad meat
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.840]   that contained the clambuterol.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.480]   I don't know what the source was.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.580]   I don't have any commentary about that,
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.840]   but it still is in use,
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.740]   but these drugs increase body temperature,
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.940]   increase fat loss, but carry a severe danger.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.560]   And that's the danger of hyperthermia.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.680]   In fact, I would argue,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.760]   and I think in talking to some folks
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.940]   at various professional fighting organizations,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.660]   it's very clear that a lot of the deaths
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.960]   that one sees in professional combat sports
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.040]   may have to do as much with dehydration and overheating
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.360]   as it does with getting hit in the head,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.800]   which is also bad, but that things can compound.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.920]   They can have a synergistic effect.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.800]   And just a note about that
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.480]   and hyperthermia and its dangers as well.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.240]   My first project ever in science
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.260]   was to evaluate the thermogenic effects of MDMA, of ecstasy.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.640]   That was my senior thesis in college, actually.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.080]   And so what we found was that indeed,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.920]   drugs that remove your understanding of how warm you are
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.560]   cause you to not take on the appropriate behaviors
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.240]   to cool yourself, right?
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.680]   So your vasoconstriction and your sweating,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.840]   those are autonomic.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.280]   Those are going to happen no matter what,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.420]   unless you happen to take something that blocks that effect.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.140]   However, there are a lot of things that we as humans do
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.080]   to prevent ourselves from overheating.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   And the main one is stop.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.960]   When we are running in the desert
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.180]   or when we're running very hard and suddenly we stop,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.040]   oftentimes that's because the muscles are overheating.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.440]   It's a subconscious thing.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.920]   We won't often think, oh, I'm really much too warm.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.600]   It's just that we stop
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.760]   and it's a self-preservation mechanisms.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.120]   Sometimes it kicks in too early.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.320]   Sometimes it kicks in too late.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.400]   Kicks in too late, you can die.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.380]   There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.100]   where that was the first year, I believe,
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.360]   that there was a women's marathon.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.560]   I think that's correct.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.980]   And one of the front runners or top picks for winning
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.480]   was heading into the stadium.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.240]   And all of a sudden it seemed as if she was lost.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.600]   She was kind of wandering around
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.120]   not knowing where she should go.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.160]   And in fact, she was in a position to win
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.720]   or at least take second place, at least take silver,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.040]   got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.720]   And she was hyperthermic.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.680]   She was running against that reflex to stop.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.600]   So dumping heat is key.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   So how do you dump heat in order to perform longer safely?
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.280]   Well, in order to understand that,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.840]   you have to understand that the body
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.620]   has three main compartments for regulating temperature.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.680]   We don't just have a center and a periphery.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.360]   We have three main compartments.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.600]   And there's one compartment in particular
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.400]   that all of you or most all of you, I have to assume, have.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.360]   And if you can understand how that works,
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.880]   you can do tremendous things for your performance
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.600]   and for your recovery.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.660]   So what I'm about to tell you will allow you
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.740]   to perform better in all forms of exercise.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.520]   And it is not commonly known, unfortunately.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.740]   I'm here to try and change that.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.000]   You have three compartments for increasing
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.960]   or dumping heat in your body.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.160]   One is your core, we already talked about that,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.860]   your core organs, your heart, your lungs,
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.000]   your pancreas, your liver, the core of your body.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.080]   The other is your periphery, which are obviously your arms
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.260]   and your legs and your feet and your hands.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.780]   But then there's a third component,
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.080]   which is there are three locations on your body
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.900]   that are far better at passing heat out of the body
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.900]   and bringing cool into the body such that you can heat up
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:19.260]   or cool your body everywhere very quickly.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.260]   Those three areas are your face, the palms of your hands
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.680]   and the bottoms of your feet.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.780]   Now the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.300]   and to some extent on your face are called glaborous skin.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S, glaborous skin.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.320]   And what's special about those areas of your body
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   and the glaborous skin is that the arrangement of vasculature
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.720]   of blood vessels, capillaries and arteries
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.380]   that serve those regions is very different
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.840]   than it is elsewhere in your body.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.340]   Now this has ancient roots.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.720]   Typically, if you were another mammal,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   like a bear or some sort of ape,
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.920]   you would have hair all over your body.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.720]   Now we all know some pretty hairy people
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.060]   or presumably you've heard that there are these hairy people.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.240]   I know a few excessively hairy people
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.720]   and Costello is excessively hairy
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.900]   but he's not a person obviously.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.800]   But all mammals have hair on their bodies.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.240]   Just some people have very light hair or very fine hair.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.860]   We don't have hair on these glaborous skin regions.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.040]   Now, of course you can have beard or facial hair growth
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.160]   but there are still regions like the cheeks
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.720]   and other areas that maintain this special vasculature.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.860]   So technically the hands and feet are real glabrous skin
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.820]   and the face is not always quite classified as glabrous
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.800]   but these three locations, palms of hands, not tops
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.360]   and bottoms of feet are very good at dumping heat
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   and bringing in cool.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.300]   And the reason is there's a rule in vascular biology
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.880]   that blood moves from arteries to capillaries
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.960]   and then to veins and then back to the heart, okay?
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.000]   So arteries, which are the big ones obviously,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.120]   capillaries, which are the little fine ones
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.400]   where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.880]   and veins, which then bring blood back to the heart
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.380]   and other tissues of course.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.920]   In these three regions of your hands, your face
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.760]   and the bottoms of your feet,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.040]   we have what are called AVAs.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.400]   AVAs are a very special pattern of vasculature.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   AVAs are described in the medical textbooks.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.720]   You can find them in Grey's Anatomy, not the television show
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.240]   but the actual Grey's Anatomy textbook
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.160]   which is a real thing that exists
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.620]   and in all medical textbooks, okay?
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.400]   So let's talk about AVAs and what they are
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.980]   and why they allow these three regions of the body
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.300]   to heat or cool ourselves more readily.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.760]   So what are AVAs?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.560]   AVAs are arteriovenous osteomoses.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.920]   So if you want to look that up, you can just look up AVAs,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.880]   veins, capillaries, arteries, if you like
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.520]   but I'll spell it for you.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.840]   A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arteriovenous, V-E-N-O-U-S,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:27.500]   arteriovenous anastomoses, A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.520]   Arteriovenous anastomoses, okay?
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.640]   You want to know about arteriovenous anastomoses, trust me.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.120]   And you want to remember that they are in your hands,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.340]   the bottoms of your feet and on your face
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.340]   and in particular on the palms of your hands,
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.720]   not the tops of your hands.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.760]   Now, before I said blood flows typically
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.820]   from arteries to capillaries to veins
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.400]   and then back to the heart
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.620]   but AVAs are direct connections
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.620]   between the small arteries and the small veins.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.380]   They bypass the capillaries to some extent.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.360]   They're little short vessel segments.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.240]   They have a big large inner diameter
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.260]   and they have this very thick muscular wall
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.200]   and they get input from what are called adrenergic neurons.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.820]   They get input from neurons
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.320]   that release norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.040]   which allows them to contract or dilate.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.400]   Now, there's some rules of physics
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.500]   that talk about how the radius of a pipe
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.320]   and small changes in the radius of a pipe
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.140]   leads to massive increases in the rate
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.280]   and amount of stuff that can flow through that pipe, okay?
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.220]   That's a rule of physics that says essentially
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.200]   that the radius is proportional
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.080]   to the amount of stuff that can flow through something
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.420]   to the fourth power.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.920]   We're not going to make this a physics class
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.960]   but if you want to look that up, you can.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.820]   You can just look up how does the radius of a tube or pipe
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.400]   relate to how quickly or how much it can,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.840]   stuff can flow through it.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.340]   What you need to know,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.200]   even if you don't want to know any of the underlying physics
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.100]   is that these AVAs allow more heat
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.940]   to leave the body more quickly
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.340]   and more cool to enter the body more quickly
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   than other venous arterial capillary beds
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.720]   throughout the body.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.840]   In other words, you can heat up best at the face,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.820]   the palms and the bottoms of the feet
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.740]   and you can cool down best at the face, the palms
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:23.620]   and the bottoms of the feet
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.660]   than you can anywhere else on your body.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.120]   When I say heat up or cool down,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.760]   I mean actually heat or cool the core and your brain, okay?
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.180]   So this is vitally important.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.600]   I realize we're getting down into the mechanistic weeds here
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.360]   but you need to know that these three compartments
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.700]   of your body, palms, bottoms of feet and face
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.120]   are your best leverage points for manipulating temperature
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.280]   to vastly improve physical performance, okay?
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.080]   I also want to point out
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.280]   that the work that I'm going to tell you about
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.920]   is not work from my laboratory.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.440]   It's the work of, as I mentioned,
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.180]   my colleague Craig Heller's laboratory at Stanford
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.360]   and we're going to have Craig on as a guest
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.660]   to talk more about these discoveries.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.240]   They are his and his colleagues discoveries
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.700]   and how you can leverage them.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.340]   They're building out some amazing technology.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.500]   I had a conversation with Craig yesterday
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.080]   as a prelude to this episode
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.240]   and to the future conversation with him.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.720]   So you're getting the very latest on this topic.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.680]   So what Craig and his colleagues did
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.560]   really illustrates perfectly
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   what these body surfaces can do and why.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:35.080]   They were studying overheating in athletes
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.160]   and in military and in construction workers
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.980]   and trying to prevent it.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.660]   And they did a bunch of experiments.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.320]   I won't go into all of them now
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.520]   but what they essentially found
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.080]   was that cooling the palms, palmer cooling
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   allowed people, athletes and recreational athletes
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.620]   to run much further, to lift more weight
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.680]   and to do more sets and reps
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.780]   to a absolutely staggering degree.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:09.160]   Let's talk for a second a bit more about why we stop,
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.620]   why we shut off effort when we get too hot.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.280]   Because in doing so, you'll really understand
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.920]   how and why the best protocols exist
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.040]   for being able to do more work,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.760]   to be able to exercise longer
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.400]   and actually to feel good doing it.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.080]   You actually can make a doubling of your dips
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.320]   or believe it or not a tripling or quadrupling
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.560]   or more of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.000]   I mentioned before that when muscle heats up,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.880]   enzymes start getting disrupted
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.840]   and ATP and muscles can't work so well
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.640]   and those muscles can't contract.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.440]   Let's get a little more specific about that.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.480]   The enzyme that's involved here
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.680]   is something called pyruvate kinase.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.360]   You don't need to know about pyruvate kinase
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.660]   but what you do need to know is that it ends ASE
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.840]   which means it's an enzyme
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   and pyruvate kinase is essentially a rate limiting step.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.120]   It's a critical step that you can't bypass
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.480]   if you want muscles to contract
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.440]   and it's very temperature sensitive.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:16.280]   Therefore, if you can keep temperature lower,
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.100]   you can do more work per unit time.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.760]   You can do more pull-ups
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.960]   and that actually was done by Craig and his colleagues.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.000]   Excuse me, the pull-ups weren't actually done by Craig.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.360]   I don't know how many pull-ups Craig can do.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.960]   I'll ask him next time, both cooled and uncooled
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.640]   how many pull-ups he can do.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.280]   But what they essentially did
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.040]   is they brought someone into their laboratory
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.380]   who could do 10 pull-ups on the first set
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.260]   and they were able to get 10 rest two or three minutes,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.080]   get another 10 rest two or three minutes
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.000]   and if you've ever tried this,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.420]   what you find is that you start dropping
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.320]   to eight, seven, six, et cetera.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.880]   Now, the person might not necessarily feel
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.340]   like they're overheating, but the muscle is heating up.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.240]   Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.960]   that these portals in the palms
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.880]   are a great way to both heat the body
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.360]   but also to dump heat from the body,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.080]   they used a device
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.120]   and I'll talk about what you can do at home
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.600]   but a device where they had people hold on
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.400]   to what was essentially a cold tube.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.340]   Now, this is crucial.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.360]   The tube can't be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.280]   because then the cold won't pass from the tube
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.080]   to the hand and to the core.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.160]   But if it's the right temperature,
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.800]   it's neither too hot nor too cold,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand,
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.360]   these so-called palmar regions and then cools the core
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.040]   and in theory, by lowering body temperature
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.320]   would allow the person or the athlete to do more work
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.920]   and indeed that's what they saw.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.760]   The actual data, the specific data showed
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.200]   that subjects could do,
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.640]   at least the subjects they worked with
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.900]   on their first day with no cooling,
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.280]   about a hundred pull-ups
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.600]   across the timeframe that they had, okay?
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.000]   So it might've taken anywhere from 10 to 15
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.120]   or maybe more sets depending on how skilled that person was
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.880]   but in a fixed amount of time.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.280]   Then they came back and did the cooling.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.640]   They did it the very next day
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.840]   which if you've ever trained a muscle the very next day,
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.960]   typically you wouldn't do as well in its training
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.920]   if it took any damage from the previous session
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.080]   or you at least do as well
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.160]   but you probably wouldn't do what they then observed
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.720]   which was they started cooling after every other set.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.160]   The person would just hold the cold tube,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.680]   cool down the body after every other set,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.080]   rest, everything else was kept the same
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.540]   and they found that they went to 180 pull-ups
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.080]   which is incredible, it's a near doubling.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   And by doing this repeatedly over several sessions,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.040]   over several weeks, they quickly went in the cooling group
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.240]   from a maximum of somewhere between 180 and 200
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.200]   as I recall I'm sort of estimating now
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.560]   to 600 pull-ups in the equivalent amount of time
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.080]   which is absolutely incredible.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.520]   They then repeated this in a study on the bench press
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.680]   and actually the bench press study was pretty interesting
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.620]   because they actually had a control group
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.920]   that was admittedly taking specific amounts
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.960]   of anabolic steroids.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.600]   The anabolic steroid was testosterone sipinate
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.400]   which is essentially testosterone
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   and indeed the testosterone sipinate,
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.240]   the steroid group improved at a rate of about 1% per week.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.840]   In other words, there were differences
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.780]   and the cooling group basically left all other groups
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.680]   in the dust, it was just remarkable.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.580]   So cooling the core, I want to be very clear
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.880]   that it's not cooling the muscle,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.720]   it wasn't about cooling the chest alone
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.360]   or just cooling the palms.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.700]   It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.920]   because of the unique vasculature that's there,
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.880]   these AVAs allowed these subjects
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.600]   to do far more work per unit time.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.620]   And the important thing is that if they were to come back
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.700]   after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups,
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.400]   you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.600]   where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.660]   They could come back, not use the cooling
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.180]   and they still saw a highly significant increase
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.040]   in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.840]   or bench press weight that they could do, okay?
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   So what that meant is that it was both
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   an excellent performance and an excellent training stimulus
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.820]   that they were able to recover from, okay?
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.380]   I don't know if all of you are following this
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:35.280]   but these are the sorts of increases in exercise output
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.120]   that are absolutely staggering
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.900]   and that's why professional teams and the military
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.300]   and others capitalized on them very quickly and use these,
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.140]   okay?
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.680]   Now you may be asking, what about endurance, right?
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.440]   Not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.060]   for multiple reps and sets.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.880]   And I should just mention for the bench pressing,
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.680]   it was, I believe they found people
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.820]   that could bench press 225, so that's two 45-pound plates
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.960]   on the 45-pound standard Olympic bar
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.880]   for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.080]   and then they had them do the same thing.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.360]   They did a set, they'd rest two or three minutes,
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   sometimes up to four minutes, then do another set,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.560]   repeat, repeat, repeat, and with cooling,
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.400]   they were able to increase the amount of work,
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.080]   the number of reps with the same weight,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.340]   sometimes they did have to increase sets
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.240]   to approximately double, so it was pretty fantastic.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.880]   So with endurance, similar increases have been shown
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.280]   and the way that they would do those tests
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.160]   are a little bit different and they also point
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.040]   to a really important mechanism of why we stop doing work
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.780]   at all when we perceive
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.280]   that we are putting in too much effort.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.440]   So it gets right to the heart of the relationship
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.920]   between temperature in muscle and your willpower.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.320]   Those are directly related.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.880]   Your body heat and your willpower
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.000]   are linked in a physiological way.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.280]   So I'm not talking about the kind of stuff
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.180]   that you see as kind of like clickbait on the internet
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.720]   or like increase willpower now or become resilient now
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.020]   or never do this again if you want to be mentally strong.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.540]   I'm talking about a physiological mechanism
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.000]   that exists in the body and brain that causes you to stop
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.860]   or that will allow you to continue to go harder and further
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.380]   than you normally would.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.780]   Okay, so let's talk about willpower and heat
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.220]   and how heat shuts you down.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.960]   In other words, if you are cool,
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.560]   if your body temperature is in a particular range,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.360]   not only can you go further,
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.080]   but you will go further if you want to.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.400]   Said differently, if you heat up too much,
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.240]   you will stop or you will die.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.360]   Typically people stop.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.200]   There are individuals who will push to the point
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.720]   where they black out and die in the same way that,
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   and please don't do this experiment.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   There are people who can sit down face to face
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.040]   and say, let's hold our breath
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.480]   and whoever breathes first loses.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.620]   Some people will just go until it's painful
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.140]   and then they'll gasp and take a big breath.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.360]   There are always those individuals
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.160]   who can override that reflex
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.880]   and they will go until they pass out, okay?
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.520]   And if you do that in water, you can very easily die.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.080]   So please don't do that experiment.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.080]   But there's a reflex that relates the body to the brain
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.220]   and the brain to the body that shuts off our effort
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.920]   when we get too hot.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.920]   So what Craig and his colleagues and now others have done
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.520]   is to do a test in the laboratory
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.460]   where rather than ask people to run outside
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.620]   until they absolutely don't want to run anymore,
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed, okay?
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.560]   So they have to keep up with the treadmill
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.580]   and at some point they quit.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.220]   And you take groups and you do those
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.260]   in different temperature environments.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.340]   So some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory,
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.420]   they get their heart rate up,
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.380]   so maybe their heart rate goes from 40 or 50
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.060]   baseline heart rate, maybe it gets up to 80 or 100,
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.760]   and then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.780]   and they will just plateau.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.500]   So they'll get into a steady state cadence or rhythm
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.620]   and their heart is beating at more or less a steady state.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.220]   Eventually, they'll probably stop
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.880]   'cause they have something else to do,
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   but people will continue at that temperature
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.780]   and at that heart rate,
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.820]   unless you start turning up the temperature in the room.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.940]   And at some point they will stop
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.020]   and they'll stop much earlier when it gets hot
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.020]   because of something called cardiac drift, okay?
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.700]   So let's say I'm running
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.300]   and I'm running at a steady cadence on this treadmill
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.220]   and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.700]   or 100 beats per minute, doesn't matter.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.440]   Let's say 100, just for sake of example.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.660]   Well, just making the room hotter
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.380]   is going to increase my heart rate further,
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.780]   even though I'm at the same output.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.180]   And the brain does a computation.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.600]   It somehow figures out that there's a heat component
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.820]   that's increasing heart rate
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.140]   and there's an effort component from running
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.700]   that's driving heart rate.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.220]   And if the heat component
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.100]   and the heart rate output from the effort
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.860]   get to hit a certain threshold, I stop, okay?
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.980]   And some of you may think,
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.420]   well, there are people who just run
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.180]   and run and run and never stop.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.340]   Eventually, everyone stops.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.620]   Maybe it's because the race ended.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.060]   Maybe it's because everyone else quit.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.860]   I actually saw some stuff online.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.700]   There are these races
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.820]   where people just will continuously do the same loop
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.260]   until everyone else drops out
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.380]   and then one guy or gal keeps going past everybody.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.500]   But typically it stops because the race is over
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.160]   or because people quit.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.580]   Increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.200]   in part, not entirely,
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.160]   but in part because of this thing called cardiac drift,
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.100]   which you've probably experienced
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.220]   if you've been out on a hot day and you're walking uphill,
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.140]   you might stop to take a breath.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.700]   If you sit in a sauna, your heart rate will increase.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.820]   Heat increases heart rate.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.020]   Effort increases heart rate.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.260]   At a steady effort, you'll have a steady heart rate.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.100]   If you increase the heat in the environment
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.880]   that you're engaging in that steady heart rate,
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.820]   your heart rate will now go up due to cardiac drift
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.980]   and you will quit, okay?
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.180]   So Heller and colleagues have done experiments
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.940]   where they do Palmer cooling under these environments.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.820]   And that's wonderful because not only
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.420]   does it enable people to go further and faster,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.300]   for much longer,
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.700]   that's been shown statistically significant every time,
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.060]   but it also protects the brain and body
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.740]   against hyperthermia, overheating, coma,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.700]   nerve injury, nerve death, and actual death, okay?
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.680]   So you can see why this is such a valuable tool.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.700]   So what are they doing?
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.140]   Well, in this case too,
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.820]   they're having them cool their hands
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.380]   and they're cooling the palms.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.660]   Cooling the bottoms of the feet is a little trickier,
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.260]   but cooling the face could actually work as well.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.660]   And we're going to talk about cooling the face
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.180]   and how to incorporate this.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.220]   So at this point,
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.100]   I've just really wanted to impress upon you,
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.580]   not impress you, but impress upon you,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.160]   the fact that you have these three surfaces of your body
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.260]   that are very good at passing cold into the body
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.500]   such that it cools the core body temperature.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.820]   And that's a good thing for health and safety.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.260]   And in order to maintain work output
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.060]   over longer periods of time, or actually just do more work.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.100]   I mean, to me, the result is just so staggering
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.420]   is the 100 to 180 pull-ups in the controls
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.960]   and then 600 pull-ups in the cooled individuals, right?
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.580]   They actually also feel mentally
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.140]   as if they can do more work.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.560]   It's not just that they can,
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.660]   their willpower is adjusted somehow
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.820]   by these shifts in temperature.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.940]   Now, before we continue and get to the exact ways
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.540]   that any number of us can start to use this information,
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.100]   I want to talk about the opposite thing, which is heating.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.420]   And you have to remember that these surfaces,
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.640]   the palms and the bottoms of the feet and the face,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.780]   were not just arranged with these AVAs,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.780]   these special ways to pass blood from arteries to veins
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.320]   in order to cool us for better athletic performance
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.220]   or to heat us on cold days, but for both of those things.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.880]   Now, Heller and colleagues and others have also explored
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.100]   how these can be used to heat up the core.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.240]   There are times when we want to heat up our core.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.900]   Typically, we hear that most of the heat
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.180]   escapes through our head,
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.740]   so we'll put on a hat when we go outside.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.880]   That's actually not true.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.460]   Most of your heat escapes through your face,
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.320]   the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.380]   Now you should know why that's the case.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:40.820]   What this means is that for post-surgery patients
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.240]   or for people that are hypothermic,
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.540]   indeed, you want to heat the core, right?
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.820]   But actually, I was on a swim recently
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.140]   where a friend became hypothermic.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.040]   He was kind of slurring his words
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.220]   and kind of staggering around
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.900]   when we got him back on the beach.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.900]   We brought him over to the lifeguard station.
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.900]   He turned out to be fine.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.620]   Again, this is why cold water swims
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.460]   are something that you really need to do in groups,
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.140]   not alone, and you really have to know what you're doing.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.980]   There were reasons for why this happened that day.
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.860]   But we were, basically,
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.980]   people thought we were a little strange
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.500]   until they realized what was happening.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.520]   We were walking down the beach,
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.180]   basically sandwiching him at our chest
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.320]   because we were still warmer than the ambient environment,
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.340]   the environment around us,
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.120]   and we were pushing our chests against him
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.500]   to try and warm him up to warm up his core.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.180]   In retrospect, that was the wrong thing to do.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.860]   In talking with Craig and talking to other colleagues
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.000]   that work on thermogenesis,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.300]   what we should have done was warm the palms of his hands,
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.760]   the bottoms of his feet, and his face
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.620]   because that would insulate the heat loss.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.660]   Now, he was very cold, so presumably,
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.880]   there was vasoconstriction of the veins at these locations.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.680]   And so it's not clear
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.780]   that that would have been the only strategy to use,
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:56.120]   but they have explored how to heat up post-surgery patients.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.520]   And one of the best ways to do that
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.060]   is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feet,
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.400]   get gloves on the hands,
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.580]   and if it can be done safely, to warm the face.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.500]   Now, of course, you don't want to obstruct respiration
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.940]   and things of that sort.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.360]   But again, the ability to pass heat into the body
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.900]   or to remove heat to the body
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.400]   is best done through these three surfaces.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.280]   I can't emphasize that enough.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.820]   So I mentioned before that you want to cool the palms
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:21.920]   or the bottoms of the feet,
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.660]   although that's a little harder to do, or the face,
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.980]   but not so much that the blood vessels constrict
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.380]   because then you won't be able to pass cool into the body
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.660]   because those pipes got smaller,
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.760]   and therefore, you can't pass cool into the body.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.660]   So how can you start to incorporate this?
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.380]   Well, Craig and colleagues have a company
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.080]   that they've spun out through Stanford.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.180]   We'll talk about that when we sit down with Craig
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:49.280]   that has made engineered devices that are optimal for this
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.640]   that are going to keep those passages open,
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.020]   keep the size of those veins correct
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.820]   to pass cool into the body quickly
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.320]   for sake of elite sports performance
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.180]   and even recreational sports performance.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.700]   But you can actually start to incorporate this.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.720]   First of all, I always get asked,
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.140]   how cold should the water be?
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.580]   Should it be ice water?
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.780]   Should it be very cold water?
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.000]   The answer is no.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.740]   If you want to experience some of this effect
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.920]   without a device,
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.860]   one thing you could do would be, for instance,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.120]   to do, I don't know,
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.780]   I'll use the gym or the treadmill as an example.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:26.540]   You could do your maximum number of pull-ups, stop,
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.940]   and then you could actually put your hands into
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.220]   with cool water.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:42.120]   So not ice water, not freezing cold, but cool water.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.400]   Slightly cooler than body temperature
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.940]   before you started training would be a good place to start.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.860]   You do that for 10 to 30 seconds,
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:54.180]   then you could go back and do your next set.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.700]   You would repeat the cooling.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.980]   You would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhat.
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.660]   So you might want to do that for 30 seconds to a minute.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.780]   This is not going to be perfect.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.620]   You're going to have to play with how cold to make it
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.620]   in order to get the optimal effect.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.460]   But you ought to see an effect nonetheless.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.860]   The same is true if you're running and you're fatiguing,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.320]   obviously you don't want to become hyperthermic,
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.820]   cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.620]   would be the ideal way to dump heat
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.740]   in order to be able to generate more output.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.220]   Now, the face is something
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.620]   that we haven't talked a lot about.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.020]   Everything I've told you up until now
[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:31.820]   also says that if you are somebody who tends to get cold
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.140]   when you are outside, say in the winter or even in the fall,
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   you tend to run cold, warming your face
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.820]   is going to be the most important thing that you can do.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.220]   Now, it's kind of hard to do that without looking strange,
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.300]   like wearing a ski mask or something like that,
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.300]   but that is going to be more effective
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.500]   than covering and warming any other part of your body.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.580]   Although it would be quite strange
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.920]   if you only had a ski mask on
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.900]   and you weren't wearing clothes anywhere else on your body.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.940]   I don't recommend doing that outside.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.220]   That will get you into all sorts of other kinds of trouble.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.920]   It wouldn't be good for anybody.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.500]   But now you understand the principle and the locations
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.640]   at which to deliver heat and cold.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.700]   So let's say that you are out for a run
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.380]   and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.460]   I talked to Craig about this.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.720]   I said, what would be the kind of poor person's approach
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.180]   to this before this device is commercially available?
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:24.180]   And he said, well, you could take a frozen juice can
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.980]   if you have one of those or a very cold can of soda
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.960]   and you would want to pass it back and forth
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.640]   between your two hands.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.340]   The reason the passing back and forth is really important
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.380]   is because you, again, you don't want it to be so cold
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:40.240]   that you constrict those venous portals
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.280]   that will allow cold to go into the body.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.600]   Now, there are certainly people
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.340]   that are working on bike handles
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.740]   and that can actually cool the hands.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.380]   You can expect with the Olympics coming up,
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.940]   people are aware of these data
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.540]   and are starting to incorporate it into a number of things.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.260]   Here's what you don't want to do.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.220]   And there are sports teams that I won't mention
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.320]   by name or brand that have made this mistake
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.920]   and it costs them dearly.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.320]   You don't want to cool the core
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.220]   if you want to cool the body, right?
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.660]   If it's a very hot day and you're going to train,
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:16.460]   getting into an ice bath first, sure, it will cool you down
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.680]   but that's not going to be as effective
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.700]   as cooling the palms, the bottoms of the feet and the face.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.420]   I have a friend who does some important work in this space
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.140]   with people in various, let's just say cultures
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.020]   where heat is generated quite a lot
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:34.440]   and they need to dump heat, ice packs delivered to the face
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.160]   are something that they actually use
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.000]   in order to dump heat quickly.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.880]   Now, again, you don't want to keep the ice pack on your face.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.720]   These are people that are very high work output, right?
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.460]   Firefighters and similar and very high work output.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.080]   And then they'll put this,
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:53.040]   essentially it's like a cool face mask on their face.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.860]   It'll allow their core body temperature to come down
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.700]   and then they remove it.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.080]   They're not keeping it on there so long
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.820]   that they're getting the vasoconstriction, okay?
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.060]   So there are a number of ways that you could do this.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.740]   And again, I'm not giving specific temperatures
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.220]   because it depends on how hot that day
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.620]   and how hot your body temperature is.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.740]   So you can see why there's a need
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.040]   to create more devices for this
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   but you can see a considerable improvement in endurance,
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:20.100]   in strength and in all kinds of explosive
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.340]   and sort of explosive power type output in athletics
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.220]   by using these surfaces of the hands
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.000]   and bottoms of the feet and face.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.520]   The one that I've tried
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.880]   because in anticipation of this episode
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.500]   was the dips where then I would cool my hands.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.600]   I actually decided to cool the bottoms of my feet as well
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.500]   because it just feels good
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.740]   and it's particularly hot out lately.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.780]   So no shoes or socks on,
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.640]   put my feet into the bottoms of my feet
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.100]   just kind of hovering about a centimeter or two
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.320]   below the surface of a bucket of water
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.300]   that was just slightly, it felt cool,
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.800]   slightly cooler than body temperature or so.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.620]   It just basically what came out of the spigot
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.580]   after I let it run for a little bit.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.740]   And indeed I saw a 60% increase
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.960]   in the number of dips I can do in a single session.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.500]   So it's actually a quite significant effect
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.220]   and you don't have to be perfectly precise
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.560]   in order to do it.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.100]   And of course, if you want to heat up for whatever reason,
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.040]   like you're in, you're camping
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.580]   or you're lost in the environment,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.280]   remember these three surfaces
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.360]   are going to be the best way to heat your core as well.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.340]   So up until now, we've been talking about
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.500]   how to use cold during a workout
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.560]   in order to improve performance.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.960]   And indeed cold applied to the appropriate parts of the body
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:36.700]   the appropriate times can vastly improve our performance
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.040]   in endurance and strength.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.180]   Now I want to talk about the use of temperature
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.940]   in particular cold to improve the speed
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.880]   and the depth of recovery.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.420]   Recovery is obviously vital, right?
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.860]   During a weight training session
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.580]   or during an endurance session,
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.420]   that's just the stimulus for getting better the next time.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:57.680]   And if you don't recover,
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.340]   you not only won't get better, but you'll get worse.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.400]   There's a lot of interest in the use of cold
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.420]   in order to improve recovery in the short term.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.840]   We see this and probably the best example of this
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.540]   would be fighters in combat sports between rounds
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:19.180]   or athletes in between quarters or halftime.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.620]   That's one form of recovery.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.700]   The ability to go back into the sport very soon
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.280]   on an order of minutes, anywhere from like one minute
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.820]   in between rounds in typical combat sports
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.340]   or several minutes at a halftime, et cetera.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:37.380]   Typically, what we see is people cooling their core,
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.980]   cooling the back of their neck,
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.020]   cooling the top of their head.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.860]   So it might be a sponge with cold water
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.020]   over the top of the head
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.960]   or an ice pack on the back of the neck,
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.640]   or in some case even wearing cold ice vests.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.580]   This has actually been done.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.720]   That's going to be a very inefficient way
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.100]   to improve recovery of that kind.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.980]   Far better would be to cool the face,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.820]   the palms of the hands or the bottoms of the feet
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:03.180]   for the reasons that I described up until now.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.460]   Submerging the body in an ice bath or taking a cold shower,
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.380]   say up to the neck or up to the chest
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.020]   or getting under cold water or jumping in a cold lake
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.320]   or something of that sort,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.780]   or in the locker room getting under the cold shower
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.860]   also would be a terrible way to cool off the body quickly
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.420]   compared to the ways that I described
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.500]   through the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.300]   or the face for the following reason.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.860]   First of all, it's not optimizing those portals
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.100]   of the face, palms, the hands and the feet.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.980]   And in addition, if it's very cold and you submerge
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.680]   or you cover a lot of the body with that cold,
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.980]   you're going to cause constriction of the very vessels
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.180]   and pathways that allow the body to efficiently dump heat.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:54.180]   So again, the key thing is to cool these one or two
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.780]   or three of these surfaces,
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.700]   but not so cold that you cause the vasoconstriction.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.260]   So what does this mean for you?
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.940]   It means that getting in an ice bath or a cold shower
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.460]   or putting an ice pack on the back of your neck
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.740]   in most cases is not going to be as good
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.540]   as splashing cold water on your face
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.100]   or even just holding your face with a damp cool cloth
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.660]   or something of that sort.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.380]   It's so it's kind of counterintuitive.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.580]   You think, oh, if I just jump into an ice bath,
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.480]   I'm going to cool down much faster
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.020]   than if I just cooled these one or two or three
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.360]   of these select regions of the body,
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.220]   but that's actually not the case.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.380]   And then of course there's recovery that occurs
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.760]   from session to session.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   So outside of the game or the match or the exercise session.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:43.740]   And many people are now relying on things like cryotherapy,
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.480]   which requires a lot of expensive equipment,
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.800]   big liquid nitrogen driven machine.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.660]   Those aren't so common for most people
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.100]   or accessible for most people.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.600]   But a lot of people are using cold baths
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.800]   or ice baths or cold showers.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.940]   And again, that's not going to optimize recovery.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.300]   In fact, it's going to have an additional effect
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.200]   that is going to potentially block the training stimulus.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.660]   When you get into an ice bath,
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.900]   indeed there are provided it's not very, very cold.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.880]   If you get into a cold shower
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.260]   provided it's not very, very cold,
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.700]   you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.260]   that occurs because of the training session.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.040]   But in doing so, you also are blocking pathways
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.420]   such as mTOR, mammalian targeted rapamycin,
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.500]   which are involved in the adaptation
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.060]   for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.220]   Put simply, covering the body in cold
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.940]   or immersing the body in cold after training
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.500]   can short circuit or prevent the hypertrophy
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.500]   or muscle growth response.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.020]   It has other effects that can be positive, right?
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.300]   It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.620]   It can reduce inflammation,
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.700]   but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exercise.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.920]   Now, it hasn't been examined so much for endurance work,
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.040]   but let's say you come back from a round of endurance work,
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.940]   a run or a bike or a swim,
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.180]   getting into a cool bath or cooling the palms,
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.480]   the bottoms of the feet or the face,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.260]   in my opinion, based on the science,
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.780]   would be better than completely immersing the body
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.540]   in the ice bath or the cold shower.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.340]   There is a time and a place for the use of the ice bath
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.380]   or the cold shower or the cold plunge.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.860]   Those tend to be when you want
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.140]   to deliberately increase brown fat thermogenesis
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:31.700]   or when you want to deliberately work on mental resilience.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.740]   And in a subsequent episode on fat loss,
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.040]   I'm going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.060]   specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:43.260]   But for now, since we're talking about the use of cold
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.300]   for improving performance and recovery,
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   the suggestion that I'm going to provide
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.060]   is based on the work of Craig Heller and colleagues
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.900]   that I've been talking about, as well as a excellent book.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.820]   I mainly rely on textbooks and special volume books,
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.020]   which are collections of papers from experts
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.140]   in a particular area that go beyond standard
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.840]   kind of college level textbooks.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.220]   The one that I've been relying on is called
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.500]   "Thermal Regulation and Human Performance,
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.360]   Physiological and Biological Aspects" by F.E. Marino.
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.820]   I don't know the publisher, I don't know the author.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.140]   I do recognize some of the names
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.380]   of the particular papers there,
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.180]   but I just want to be clear there's no sort of
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.280]   business relationship or deal with them,
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.300]   but it's an excellent text.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.360]   It's called "Thermal Regulation and Human Performance."
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.620]   You can find it online if you want to go
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.900]   really deep into this.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.460]   But basically what they show is that
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:32.240]   if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.180]   by resting temperature I mean within the range
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.900]   that you would see at any time of waking day,
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.540]   but not in exercise.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.620]   So just bringing the body temperature down to baseline.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.760]   If you can do that, the sooner you can do that
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.460]   after a workout, the sooner that the muscle will recover,
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.300]   that the tendons will recover, and that the person, you,
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.520]   can get back into more endurance training,
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.120]   more weight training, et cetera.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.040]   So cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.760]   but to maximize return to baseline levels of temperature,
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.300]   it's my belief based on the studies
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.780]   that are published in this book,
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.180]   as well as my discussions with my colleague Craig Heller,
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.940]   and in reviewing the literature overall,
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   that just simply cooling the entire body
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.020]   by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.480]   is not the best way to go.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.100]   You really want to rely on one of these three
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.940]   glabrous skin portals of the palms,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.020]   the bottoms of the feet, or the face.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:30.380]   So now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.240]   about how we regulate body temperature
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.820]   and how it can be applied to exercise,
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.120]   both during the exercise session
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.620]   and afterward to optimize recovery.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.640]   Many of us, all of us presumably,
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.520]   are also eating and drinking things
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.380]   and taking things at various times
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.660]   that can impact this process.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.040]   And so because of that, we should ask
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.660]   whether or not those things are impacting body temperature.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.380]   And when we do that, we find that there are certain things
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.360]   that many of us are doing
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.380]   that are actually impairing our performance.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.580]   So for instance, if you are taking a pre-workout drink
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.940]   or you're ingesting a lot of caffeine or other substance
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.600]   to bring your body temperature up before exercise,
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.700]   you are limiting the amount of exercise that you can do.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.600]   I can recall a time in college
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.220]   when I would drink a lot of espresso.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.860]   Back then ephedrine was sold over the counter.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.980]   I remember taking it.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.140]   It will really energize you for workouts.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:33.060]   You can generate a lot of energy
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.180]   and get extremely focused taking those things.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.300]   They do increase heart rate.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.820]   They can be quite dangerous.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.180]   I don't recommend people take them.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.640]   In fact, I think ephedrine is now off the shelves
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.660]   as a non-prescription compound
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.520]   because various people died from taking it
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.220]   who were sensitive to it or exercised in heat.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.700]   But looking back at that,
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.100]   I realized it was a foolish approach.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.300]   It was increasing core thermogenesis.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.820]   Sure, I might've burned a few more calories,
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.240]   but actually when I look at the data
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.940]   that are coming from specific cooling
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.520]   and how that can so increase in performance
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.940]   if done properly,
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.020]   and then I compare that to the effects
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.460]   of taking some sort of thermogenic compound,
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.020]   whatever it is, some pre-workout or some pill
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.140]   or high levels of caffeine,
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:20.340]   it's very clear that increasing body temperature
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.940]   prior to working out is the exact wrong thing
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.360]   that one would want to do.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.900]   You don't want to stay so cold
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.940]   that you can't generate good muscle contractions.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.540]   You don't want to be like I am coming out of the cold ocean
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.100]   with claws for hands,
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.980]   but one wants to have your body temperature
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:38.780]   in a range that still allows you to work hard
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:40.020]   and perform well.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.580]   Now, in terms of recovery,
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.980]   things like alcohol, we know are vasodilators.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.420]   So those are going to cause people to drop body temperature.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.540]   So you might think, oh, well, that sounds great for recovery.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.500]   And I don't think people should be drinking
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.700]   who have problems with alcohol intake,
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.380]   alcoholics or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:01.400]   I'm not a drinker,
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.140]   but I do have a good friend who's a quite accomplished athlete
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.460]   who basically drinks a beer or two
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.720]   after his long runs or cycling.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.640]   And his argument is, well, I'm dumping body heat
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.060]   and I like a beer and he's probably right.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.480]   It's probably a really good tool
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.400]   provided you don't have issues with alcohol
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.140]   that would preclude that as a tool
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.660]   or you're not of drinking age.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:26.300]   But anything that you ingest after exercise
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.040]   that would increase body temperature
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.980]   is going to impede recovery.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.200]   Anything that you do that lowers body temperature
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   provided it's in safe ranges is going to accelerate recovery.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.860]   And that brings us to the whole host of compounds
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:44.300]   that people take that can increase body temperature.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.920]   And many people are taking these things
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.180]   in order to increase fat burning and increase metabolism.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.420]   But in my opinion,
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.380]   it's impeding their ability to perform well.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.980]   And especially if the performance is something
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.900]   that you're focused on aside from body recomposition,
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.620]   losing fat, building muscle.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.000]   But even if you're focused on losing fat, building muscle,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   you have to ask yourself,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.120]   is the body temperature increase
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.180]   that I'm getting from these compounds really worth it?
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:14.220]   Given that it can block or prevent my performance
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.400]   from being as good as it could.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.320]   In other words, is it worth taking something
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.380]   that makes you feel very energized to go work out,
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.540]   but then you now know that you are stopping earlier
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.980]   and you're performing less well,
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.860]   fewer reps, fewer steps overall.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.620]   Is it worth it if you had not taken that thing,
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.700]   then you could perform much longer
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.020]   and at much higher capacity.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.260]   Some of you are probably saying, well, that's ridiculous
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.980]   because when I drink a quadruple espresso
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.420]   and I pop a whatever pre-workout or drink a pre-workout,
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.660]   then I know I can go much further.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.920]   Ah, that might be true,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.480]   but the increase in temperature is also costing you
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.940]   on the recovery side.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.120]   And unless you're doing other things
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.540]   to improve your recovery,
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.340]   and I know many people that are, I don't judge,
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.880]   but many people who are doing those things
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.340]   are also augmenting their recovery
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.840]   through hormone augmentation
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.340]   and other performance enhancing tools,
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.700]   then for the typical person who's not doing that,
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.700]   it's probably shooting yourself in the foot.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.080]   So let's take a look at what some of those compounds are
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.620]   and what they do, and just briefly review
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:19.380]   whether or not they would be a good or a bad idea to include
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.640]   if your main goals are performance
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.580]   or your main goals are body recomposition or both.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.600]   So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.620]   This could be caffeine,
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:30.220]   this could be any other kind of stimulant
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.220]   that are typically in a pre-workout drink
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.380]   or anything that might get you revved up before exercising.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.120]   This could even be very strong tea.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.180]   I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.300]   I like a yerba mate, I love that stuff.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.220]   And I also drink caffeine.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.940]   I drink, I love coffee of various kinds,
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.540]   mushroom coffee, black coffee, espresso, et cetera.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.940]   I'm a chronic caffeine user.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.340]   I don't think I'm an addict,
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.980]   but I'm a chronic caffeine user,
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.820]   meaning when I drink caffeine,
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.020]   my heart rate doesn't increase so much
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.660]   that it feels like a shock to my system.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.680]   Some people are not caffeine adapted
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.700]   or they're very caffeine sensitive.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.900]   Here's the straightforward rule.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:14.140]   Caffeine for somebody who doesn't drink caffeine very much
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.940]   will constrict the blood vessels
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.820]   and will increase retention of body heat.
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.740]   And it's probably a bad idea before exercise.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.540]   For somebody who's caffeine adapted
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.580]   and is used to drinking caffeine,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.580]   it won't have that vasoconstriction effect.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:32.180]   That's what the data point to because I'm adapted to it.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.500]   But it will cause vasodilation
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.940]   and will allow me to dump body heat.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.380]   So for me, I use it before I train
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.800]   or do any kind of exercise
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.340]   because I tend to do that early in the day,
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.700]   it won't prevent me from sleeping
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.860]   and it causes vasodilation.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.900]   And then afterwards,
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.180]   I'm aware that it causes vasoconstriction
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.020]   after the caffeine wears off.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:53.500]   So for somebody who drinks two or three or more
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.340]   cups of coffee a day or mate a day,
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.740]   so we're talking intake of anywhere
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.120]   from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.780]   what you want to do is you want to make sure
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.100]   that you would do that before exercise
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.540]   and probably not after exercise.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.340]   That just makes logical sense
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.260]   given what we know about thermal regulation.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.660]   And if you're somebody who doesn't drink caffeine,
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.620]   drinking caffeine before a workout
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.140]   is going to be about the worst thing
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.960]   that you could possibly do
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.100]   because it's going to increase core body temperature
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.740]   through its thermogenic effects
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.220]   and it's going to constrict your blood vessels
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.340]   and make it even harder to dump heat.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.180]   So I don't suggest that people drink caffeine or not.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.180]   I just suggest that you think about
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.620]   whether or not you're caffeine adapted or not
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.900]   and decide whether or not you want to drink caffeine.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.700]   In general, you're going to be better
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.380]   not drinking any caffeine than you are drinking caffeine
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.900]   unless you're a heavy caffeine user or abuser,
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.780]   in which case not drinking caffeine
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.400]   is going to give you vicious headaches
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.780]   and is going to make it very hard to get motivated
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.080]   because you're just not used to it.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.000]   It takes about three weeks to get used to no caffeine.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.840]   It's brutal.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.680]   I've done it before.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.960]   I've done caffeine fast.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.340]   I don't know that I ever want to do it again.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.940]   That's how painful it was.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.160]   But you get headaches because of the effects
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.400]   on vasodilation and constriction.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.960]   If you like caffeine, use in moderate amounts
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.980]   and use it before your workout's not after.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.220]   If you don't like caffeine or you don't use it very often,
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.420]   stay away from it anywhere close to exercise,
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.840]   before or after, for that matter.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.900]   One of the more commonly used compounds
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.420]   that's sold over the counter
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:26.260]   are non-steroid anti-inflammatories.
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.980]   So things like Tylenol and Advil and other trade names
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.120]   and naproxen sodium, things of that sort.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:36.080]   Almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.600]   And that's why it's often recommended
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.640]   that people take them when they have a fever.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.460]   Although the whole business
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.300]   of dropping body temperature artificially
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.360]   when you have a fever is itself an interesting discussion
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.260]   whether or not that's the most adaptive
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:50.300]   or best thing to do.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.940]   Certainly you don't want fever to go too high,
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.920]   can be very dangerous, can kill you.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.140]   But artificially dropping body temperature
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.540]   with these compounds can be tricky.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.780]   Now, a number of athletes, especially endurance athletes,
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.200]   will rely on these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.260]   specifically to keep body temperature lower
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.540]   during long bouts of exertion.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.580]   This is a little bit of a pharmacologic version
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:18.420]   of dumping heat instead of using Palmer cooling
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.620]   or face ice pack cooling,
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.100]   they're relying on pharmacology
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.400]   to drop their core body temperature.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.960]   That has certain obvious advantages.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.000]   Those advantages should be obvious
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.820]   and the reasons for them should be obvious
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.700]   based on everything we've talked about up until now.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.600]   Lower temperature allows you to go further harder
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.500]   with more intensity.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.460]   However, they do have effects on the liver
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:45.020]   and they can also have effects on the kidneys
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.800]   and during long bouts of exercise
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.040]   or even short bouts of exercise,
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.600]   water balance and salt balance
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.500]   are also going to be vital to maintain
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.360]   in order to perform well,
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.060]   generate the best muscle contraction,
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.460]   stay mentally alert and also to stay alive.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.100]   We will do an episode on salt electrolytes
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.480]   and water and water balance,
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.080]   but you probably want to think carefully
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.940]   about whether or not you want to use
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:12.400]   non-steroid anti-inflammatories before any training session
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.420]   just for the performance augmentation effect,
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.300]   unless you're working carefully with a coach,
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.460]   whether or not you've done that in practices
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.260]   and of course, whether or not you are in a situation
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.860]   where monitoring your body temperature carefully
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.820]   is going to be important.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.140]   You might ask, well, when would that be?
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:34.140]   Well, desert races, summer training in races, winter rides,
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.300]   you certainly don't want to get too cool either.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:41.260]   So alcohol, caffeine and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.900]   because of their effects on temperature
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.180]   will impact performance and recovery,
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:47.480]   but you want to be cautious about how you approach them.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.200]   I personally am more a fan of using caffeine
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.020]   in moderate doses for the reasons I described before,
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.660]   as well to use the cooling of the palms,
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.100]   cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right?
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.500]   By placing them into a bucket
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.860]   or into a cool bath after training
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.180]   or cooling the face after training
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.860]   or sometimes even during training.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.640]   It just seems like there's more of a margin
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.860]   to play with the variables,
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.840]   to heat up the water or cool it down a little bit,
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.220]   to include one palm or the other palm.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.860]   There's just all sorts of good parameter space,
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.660]   as we call it in science, that you can play with
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.800]   and work with to find what works for you.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.540]   Whereas when you pop a pill, sure, you can adjust the dose
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.000]   and you can adjust it next time,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.400]   but once it's in you, it's in you,
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.060]   and there's going to be some period of time
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.900]   before you can modulate it.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.240]   What I've offered today are ways
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.940]   in which you can use temperature
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.740]   to powerfully improve performance.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.580]   And if you think about it,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.380]   you can vary that from set to set.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.000]   You could do your pull-ups or your sprints
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.720]   and then cool your palms
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.660]   and then try and go with colder water the next round
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.340]   or warmer water the next round
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:56.360]   or do both feet and palms and face.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.600]   I mean, you can do all sorts of things moment to moment
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.280]   and see what works for you.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.860]   Again, essentially zero cost or no cost.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:06.240]   Whereas when you pop something, you take a pill,
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.360]   you're basically in that regimen
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.460]   for the next hour or two or more.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.980]   You can always take more, but you can't really take less.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.160]   You can't really extract it from your body in real time.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.080]   So it doesn't give you a lot of opportunity
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.640]   to play scientist, which is what I like to do,
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.160]   because what I'm always trying to do
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.920]   is trying to dial in the best protocols possible
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.520]   based on the mechanisms and data.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.920]   And if you can do that moment to moment,
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.240]   that places you in a position of power.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.880]   Once again, we've covered a lot of material.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.000]   By now, after seeing this episode
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.980]   or listening to this episode,
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.760]   you should understand a lot about how your body heats
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.140]   and cools itself and the value of that
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.240]   for physical performance.
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.480]   I hope you'll also appreciate
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.420]   that you have tools at your disposal
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:49.480]   to vastly improve your physical performance.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.200]   And should you try those, please let us know how it goes.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.660]   If you decide to do Palmer cooling during your runs
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.760]   or after your runs, during your weight workouts,
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.240]   during your yoga sessions, whatever it is, let us know.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.380]   Please place that in the comments.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.760]   I've given you specific protocols and some direction,
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.960]   but I've also left it slightly vague
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.000]   because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.760]   I don't know all the environmental conditions.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.800]   I don't know how hot your yoga studio is
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.520]   or how cool your gym happens to be
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.340]   or your body temperature or time of day.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.080]   Remember, your temperature will vary
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.240]   according to the time of day.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.700]   We did a whole episode about that related to sleep.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.800]   Typically, your body temperature is rising early in the day
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   and is coming down as you approach the late evening
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.500]   and late night hours for sleep.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.720]   In the middle of the night, your temperature is very low,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   at its absolute lowest,
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.440]   something we call the temperature minimum.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.100]   So we don't know exactly where you're at.
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.860]   You need to take the information that you received today,
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.100]   and should you try and incorporate it,
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.400]   try and do it intelligently.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.680]   Don't cool yourself off so much that you become cryogenic,
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.520]   and please don't warm yourself up.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.520]   In fact, we didn't talk at all about warming yourself up
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.980]   because warming yourself up too much can be quite dangerous.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.500]   You never, ever, ever want to be hypothermic.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.760]   That's what your body and your brain are trying to avoid.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.680]   We talked a little bit about supplements,
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.560]   but not the standard sorts of supplements
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.520]   I usually list off on these episodes.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.000]   Rather, we talked about caffeine,
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.860]   non-steroid anti-inflammatories,
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.160]   and how those can impact temperature,
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.240]   how alcohol can impact temperature.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.180]   And I should just mention in closing that every time we eat,
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.380]   we also increase temperature.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.980]   There's a eating-induced thermogenic effect,
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.080]   but that's a minor one.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:27.920]   That's a small one.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.740]   So you wouldn't worry about eating before training
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.220]   because of its effects on temperature,
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.960]   because it tends to be really minor.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.400]   Going forward, we're going to talk more about temperature
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.780]   and other ways to improve physical performance
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.640]   and skill learning.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.620]   We're going to talk about specific ways
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:48.740]   to accelerate fat loss, to improve muscle growth,
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:52.400]   to improve suppleness and flexibility.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.560]   These approaches and mechanisms are anchored deeply
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.360]   in neuroscience and physiology
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.800]   and the relationship between our peripheral organs,
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.840]   which include our skin, and our brain,
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.640]   and all the organs in between.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.180]   So it's really a pleasure for me
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:10.460]   because I'm able to look to the textbook literature
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.280]   that exists and really came out
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.400]   over the last 50 to 100 years.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.380]   And unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience,
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.240]   which are still sort of mystical,
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.160]   like consciousness and dreaming,
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.180]   of which we understand a little bit about,
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.600]   these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology,
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.080]   which are so powerful, involve very concrete studies
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.740]   that, as you learned today, are very actionable.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.200]   If you're enjoying this podcast

[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.580]   and we will be releasing additional content
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.480]   in between episodes from time to time.

[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.720]   if you think that we deserve a five-star review,
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.560]   and to leave us feedback.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.080]   They have a comment section there.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.240]   It's really a feedback section where you can rate
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.580]   and describe the podcast as you experience it.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.560]   If you'd like to support the podcast in other ways,

[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.360]   That's a terrific way to support us.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.720]   We also have a Patreon.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   You can find it at patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.560]   That allows you to support the podcast
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.640]   at any level that you like.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.700]   Today, we didn't focus so heavily on supplements,
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:38.280]   but in other episodes I have,
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.120]   and there are certainly supplements
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.520]   that are beneficial for sleep, for performance,
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.840]   for learning, immunity, and so forth,
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.840]   we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com,
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.880]   because Thorne supplements,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.460]   we believe to be the most stringent in terms of
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.840]   what they put on the bottle
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.040]   is actually what's in the bottle,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.300]   so the amounts are precise,
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.520]   and the quality of the ingredients is very precise.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.120]   They partner with the Mayo Clinic,
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.320]   all the major sports teams,
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.140]   so we're delighted that we're partnered with Thorne.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:09.080]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.800]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.460]   and you can see the supplements that I take.
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.160]   You could get 20% off any of those supplements,
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.400]   should you choose to order them,
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.880]   as well as 20% off any other supplements
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.500]   that Thorne happens to make.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.500]   That's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.240]   to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.040]   And last but not least,
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.820]   I want to thank you for your time and attention.
