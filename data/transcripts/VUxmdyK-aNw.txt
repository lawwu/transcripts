[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   there's a famous donor story
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.680]   where there was a nine-year-old girl named Rachel Beckwith,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.840]   and she saw me talk.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.160]   And at the time, I would ask everyone in the audience
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.400]   to donate their next birthday to Charity Water.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.960]   And Rachel took me seriously at this,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.240]   and she donates her ninth birthday,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.420]   and she sets a goal of $300,
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.920]   which was gonna help the time
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.260]   10 people get access to water.
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.420]   And she cancels her birthday party, won't accept gifts,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.760]   and she raises $220.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.600]   So she falls short in her goal,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.880]   and she tells her mom she feels like she's failed,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.300]   and she's gonna try harder next year.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.200]   And her mom's like, "Hey, I think you're pretty awesome."
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.440]   Well, right after her birthday, she dies in a car crash.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   Her mom was driving, her sister was in the front,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.320]   she was smashed in the backseat.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.200]   Her pastor had emailed me to let me know,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.560]   and he asked me, "Could we reopen her campaign?"
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.320]   It spreads to the New York Times,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.680]   it spreads to the morning shows.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.040]   People in Africa start donating $9 in Rachel's name.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   She goes from $220 to $1.3 million in donations.
