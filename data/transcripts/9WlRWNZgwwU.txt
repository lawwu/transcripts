[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700]   What would it look like in your life
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.260]   to know that God loves you?
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.540]   I mean to know that he really loves you.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540]   Would that love be proven in a new job
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.200]   or maybe a better job?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.380]   Would it be an open door
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.520]   that will allow you greater financial independence?
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.300]   Maybe it would be to find a spouse
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.860]   or maybe deliverance from chronic pain
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.020]   that depletes your energy.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.320]   Or maybe it would look like being delivered
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.380]   from the consuming demands of a special needs child.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.100]   But what if the answer to that question,
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.360]   whether God loves us or not,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.220]   was something altogether different than what we expected?
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.300]   What if instead of any of these things,
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.300]   God showed his love to you by letting you die in sickness?
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.120]   It's a crazy thought, right?
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.800]   Totally counterintuitive.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.720]   And yet this is exactly what we read about
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.680]   in John 11, verses one to 44.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.120]   Listen to this extraordinary story
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.480]   because in it we find a life-changing lesson
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.440]   God wants all of us to grasp.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.520]   Here's Pastor John to explain
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.560]   in one of his sermons from 2001.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.400]   This is John 11.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.160]   I have used this text now in about five settings
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.840]   in the last couple of months
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.640]   because no other text has gripped me like this
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.240]   in driving home this central point.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.320]   Now a certain man was sick, John 11, one.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.520]   Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany,
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.320]   the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.740]   It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.060]   and wiped his feet with her hair.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.040]   So this is clearly a picture of sweetness and love.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   Mary loved Jesus and Jesus loved Mary.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.540]   Mark that word love.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.000]   It will show up several more times.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.420]   It was this woman whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.320]   Verse three, so the sisters sent word to him saying,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.960]   "Lord, behold, he whom you love," there it is,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   "he whom you love is sick."
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.260]   But when Jesus heard this, he said,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.720]   "This sickness is not to end in death,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.160]   "but for the glory of God,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   "so that the Son of God may be glorified in it."
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.080]   So now you have two profound realities on the table,
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.720]   love and glory.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.760]   The love of Christ and the glory of Christ.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.240]   And my question is, how do they relate to each other?
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.100]   Verse five, "Now Jesus loved Martha
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000]   "and her sister and Lazarus,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.520]   "so," verse six, "so when he heard that he was sick,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.980]   "he stayed two days longer in the place where he was
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.460]   "and let him die."
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.300]   Notice three things.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.840]   One, Jesus chose to let Lazarus die.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.060]   Two, he was motivated in this
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.560]   by his zeal for the glory of God to be manifest.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.320]   Verse four, third, this motivation is love.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.100]   Do you see the word so or therefore
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.900]   at the beginning of verse six?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.460]   Do you see what it's preceded by and followed by?
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   It's preceded by Jesus loved Martha.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.580]   Jesus loved Mary.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.540]   Jesus loved the dying man, Lazarus.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.060]   Therefore, he did not go heal him,
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.020]   but stayed two days longer where he was
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.180]   and saw to it that he died.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.700]   Now what on earth could possibly turn that into love?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.740]   Verse four, "This is not going to end in death.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.140]   "This is all about the glory of God,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.700]   "that the Son of God may be glorified in him."
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.360]   So here's my definition of the love of God
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.300]   based on this text.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   God's love is his doing whatever needs to be done
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.020]   at whatever cost so that we will see
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.780]   and be satisfied with the glory of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.500]   Let me say it again.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   The love of God is his doing whatever needs to be done
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.920]   at whatever cost to himself or to us
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.760]   so that we will see and be satisfied
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.680]   by the love of God in Christ forever and ever.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.360]   Let me confirm this with John 17, 24.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.440]   Here's Jesus praying for us,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.920]   and he loves us in this prayer.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.940]   Oh, how he loves us in this prayer.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   John 17, 24, "Father, I desire that they also,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.260]   "whom you have given me, may be with me where I am
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.900]   "so that they may see my glory."
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.160]   If Jesus loves you and prays for you,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.700]   do you know what he finally asks for you?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.860]   That you may see him.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.340]   The ultimate answer to the prayer of love is,
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.180]   "Show them my glory, Father.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.820]   "Show them my glory," and they will have arrived
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.940]   at ultimate satisfaction.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.660]   Why do you want to be loved by God?
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.580]   Yes, not to perish.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.220]   Yes, not to go to hell.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.980]   Yes, not to have a guilty conscience anymore.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.380]   Yes, to have the marriage put back together,
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.020]   but if that's all you want, you don't know him.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.100]   You don't know him.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.240]   It's for life, and what is life?
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.580]   It is to know him and his son.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.020]   It's to fellowship with him.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.380]   It's to behold him.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.340]   It's to be satisfied with him.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.340]   It's to enjoy him until Christ becomes our treasure.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.520]   We don't know what it is to be loved by God.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.040]   Why are you thankful for the love of God today?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.140]   I hope before we're done, God will have worked in your heart
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.360]   so that you see enough of God the Father
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.820]   and enough of God the Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   so that you will know and feel that it is not finally
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.560]   for the relief of your conscience.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.140]   It is not finally for escape from hell.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.340]   It is not finally for health in our bodies
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.000]   or reconciliation among our family members.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It is finally to bring you home to God,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.080]   where you can see him and enjoy him forever
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.600]   and ever and ever.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   And I wanna know, do you want this?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   Do you want this?
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.680]   Do you want to be loved by God for God?
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   Do you wanna be loved by God for God,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.360]   or do you only want to be loved by God
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   because it feels good that he seems to make much of you?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.960]   Have you taken the American definition of love,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.280]   being made much of, and so twisted God
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.800]   to fit that definition?
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   Now, the only way you would feel loved by God
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.400]   is if he makes much of you,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.680]   when in fact, the love of God is so working
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.920]   as to change you so that you enjoy making much of him
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.400]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.480]   And that's the end of your quest.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.400]   There isn't anything beyond it.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.800]   I do believe that is in every heart in this room.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.720]   And we are all fallen and we are all sinners.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.600]   And I know that every person in this room
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   has a distorted desire for God.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.600]   And it's on the way to being purified.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   And it's being tricked.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.120]   You're being tricked, many of you,
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:20.240]   into thinking that the satisfying thing in life
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.480]   is to be made much of.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.400]   If I could just get some people to clap for me,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   to like me, to approve me, to give me a raise,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.640]   or to give me an advancement,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.040]   if I could just get someone to pay attention to me,
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.340]   I would be satisfied.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.360]   You wouldn't.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.840]   I promise you, in the name of Jesus Christ Almighty,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.080]   you wouldn't.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   You will be satisfied when you forget yourself
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.040]   and are swallowed up in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.360]   And he becomes your treasure,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   and he becomes your delight,
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.720]   and he becomes what you cherish and what you value.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.080]   And you spend the rest of your eternity
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.280]   growing in your capacity to see and savor,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   to know and delight in him forever and ever,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.980]   and it will get better and better and better.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.860]   - Powerful.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.680]   The love of God is his doing whatever needs to be done
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.480]   at whatever cost to himself or to us
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.600]   so that we will see and be satisfied
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.200]   by the love of God in Christ forever and ever.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.600]   Did you get that?
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.280]   That was from John Piper's sermon
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.440]   preached on November 18th, 2001,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.880]   titled "Thankful for the Love of God,"
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.040]   a sermon on 2 Corinthians 12, verses seven to 10.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.360]   The entire message is, of course,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.100]   online at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.640]   Do you have a powerful clip from a John Piper sermon?
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   If so, email me.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.000]   Give your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.220]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.120]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.800]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.660]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.200]   Well, back to dating questions next time
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.360]   with an email from a young woman
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.320]   asking whether or not she should settle
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.520]   for a spiritually lethargic boyfriend.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.520]   What standards should be in place?
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.560]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   when we return on Friday for that, and we'll see you then.
