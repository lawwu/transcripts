[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   All right, up to this particular point, we have been talking about more recently the
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.440]   process dynamics of marriage and the family counseling.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.340]   We don't have that much further to go on this, but this is such an important section because
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.120]   it really breaks down the details on how to work with marriage and the family counseling
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.040]   issues in an organized way, in a thoughtful way, in a way that's going to draw out, as
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.680]   Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 5 says, the issues of a person's heart, as those issues
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.160]   or those plans or purposes that are part of the heart are like deep water, but a man of
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.300]   understanding is able to draw them out.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.840]   So hopefully we're developing understanding through this process.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   So we're actually, in your notes there, we're on number nine.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.700]   Number nine says, "As you seek to accurately analyze and assess, you will also want to
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.640]   identify why the family problems have developed and continued as they are."
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.120]   And we want to break down the answer to this four different ways or four different reasons.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.960]   Why have these marriage and family problems occurred?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.480]   Let's answer it from one perspective, first of all, and that is a lack of inspiration,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.280]   we're going to say.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   What do we mean by that?
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.780]   And we mean by that, they really have no hope.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.600]   Maybe they've read some books on marriage and the family.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.840]   Maybe these books have been written by well-intentioned Christians.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.140]   Maybe those books have actually been written by Christians who call themselves counselors
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.120]   or psychotherapists or psychologists, and they've tried to implement some of those things
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   that are a part of those books and things have just gone from bad to worse.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.260]   Or maybe they've heard seminars, or they've gone to marriage retreat weekends, and they've
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.560]   heard speakers speak on marriage and family issues, and it still hasn't helped them a
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   whole lot.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.800]   In fact, they've tried to go back and implement those things into their marriage, and for
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.760]   a while things got better, but then they find themselves right back in the same problems
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.400]   that they had before.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.840]   The reason is maybe they've tried and failed, or they've not tried it God's way, or this
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.800]   particular problem really has basically gone on too long.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.880]   And so that's the reason why they lack inspiration, they lack hope.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.960]   They may actually come to you as a pastoral counselor, as a last resort.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.760]   You hate it when that happens, I always do, when they come as a last resort, you would
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   hope that they would come to you as a first resort, not as a last resort.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.440]   But by this time the problems are so embedded, so deep, there's so much hopelessness that's
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.480]   going on.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.040]   You look at it and you say, "Well, I know God is mighty and powerful, but this is going
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.400]   to be, it's going to take a while to dig out of this one."
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.960]   So what do we need to emphasize when something like this has occurred?
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.120]   Well, you have to, when there is a lack of hope.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.640]   You have to minister hope.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.560]   And I want to take you over to a few of these passages real quickly.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.840]   Of course, the real common one there is 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 13.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920]   This is always a wonderful, wonderful passage of hope.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.080]   And I want to give you an example of how this could be used.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.760]   1 Corinthians 10, 13, "No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man, and God
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.720]   is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.840]   the temptation, he will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.720]   it."
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.880]   Now that says to me, often I will say to the counselees, that says to me that you're not
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.480]   the only person to have ever faced these problems.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   There have been other people down through history, other husbands, other wives, other
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   parents who have faced these problems before, and they've been able to face them successfully.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.720]   There's nothing that you're facing in your marriage or in your parenting that's unique
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.860]   here.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.280]   You may think you're unique.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.640]   You may think you're the only one to face this particular problem.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   Sometimes I call that the Elijah syndrome.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   That's what he thought.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.480]   He thought he was the only one.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.000]   He was the only one that was left.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.580]   You may think you're the only one, but that's not true.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.220]   There have been other people who have faced this particular problem, and they've been
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.480]   able to face it successfully.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.720]   And we're also told here that God is faithful.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:10.280]   He's not going to allow you to be tempted or tested here beyond what you're able to
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.660]   handle.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.880]   That's part of the faithfulness of God.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.280]   He knows your limits.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.680]   Now you may have an idea about what your limits are, and God has a different idea about what
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.800]   your limits are.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.560]   He may take you beyond what you think your limits are, but he's not going to take you
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   beyond what the real limits are, and that's what he says your limits are.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   God will not take you beyond what you're able to handle.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.120]   But with that temptation, he will also provide a way of escape.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.240]   That doesn't mean, some counselees want to interpret that as escaping from my problems.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.800]   That doesn't mean escaping from the problems, and in fact, that particular word escape is
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.080]   qualified by the next phrase so that you will be able to endure it.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.640]   That escape means he gives you a method to deal with your problems.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.520]   He doesn't necessarily get you out of the problem.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.600]   You escape your hopelessness is the idea.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.800]   You don't escape the problem.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   You now have something specific to be able to do about your problem, and he gives you
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.760]   the ability to be able to endure it.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.120]   That's great.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.280]   That begins to minister hope.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.200]   The other passage that's there is Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 7.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.400]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 7.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.920]   In fact, my son and I were just talking about this passage today because he's leading a
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.120]   high school Bible study here at Grace tonight, and this is what he's talking about.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.080]   He's talking at the end of Hebrews 11 and then into Hebrews chapter 12, and verse 7
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.440]   says, "It is for discipline that you endure."
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   Actually, one translation of this is really good.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   It talks about we are to endure hardship as discipline.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.520]   That's really what this is saying.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.040]   All hardship that we encounter in life, all difficulty that we encounter in life is to
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.920]   be endured as discipline.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.080]   He's not using discipline in the sense here of punitive discipline.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.460]   It's not the idea.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.240]   It's not punitive discipline.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.640]   It's discipline the way in which a coach would discipline a team, like a basketball coach
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.120]   would discipline a basketball team, or a football coach would discipline a football team, or
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.560]   a soccer coach would discipline a soccer team.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   In a similar way, God uses hardship to discipline us, and he says in verse 8, "But if you are
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   and not sons."
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.480]   Of course, he's writing to a group of Jewish Christians who are undergoing severe persecution
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.600]   for their faith, and some of them that were part of this assembly were thinking about
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.280]   renouncing Christ and returning to their Judaistic worship, and that would let up all the pressure.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:23.200]   Verse 9, "Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.080]   Shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of our spirits, and live?
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.120]   For they," speaking of our earthly fathers, "disciplined us for a short time as seemed
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   best to them."
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.920]   It wasn't always best, but it seemed best to them.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   But he always disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.560]   In other words, all hardship that we encounter is always for our good.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.280]   Wow, how about that?
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.340]   Everything we encounter in terms of hardship is for our good, that's right.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:02.440]   Even when my husband or my wife is disagreeable, that's for my good, yes.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:11.320]   Even when my kids are misbehaving and they're a handful, absolutely.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.280]   Verse 11, "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful," wow, all
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.960]   God's people can say a hearty amen to that, "yet to those who have been trained by it,"
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.600]   not punished for it, this is not punitive discipline, "they're trained by it, afterwards
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.000]   it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.760]   So the whole purpose is to develop holiness in our lives.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.520]   Why am I going through these marital problems?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.200]   Why am I going through these problems with my children?
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.980]   One of the big problems with that question is we assume that we don't deserve to go through
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.980]   problems.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.240]   That's a big assumption and it's an erroneous assumption.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.840]   But all right, if God is in sovereign control of all things that occur, including the fine
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.320]   details of my life and my marriage, then I must be going through these hardships as Hebrews
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:18.000]   12 says, in order to produce greater holiness in my life, to train me in righteousness.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.480]   Let me take you to one other passage that's a good hope passage.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.520]   Let's go over to Romans.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:41.280]   I want to go to Romans chapter 15 and verse 4, "As you get your counselees into the Scriptures,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.120]   let the Scriptures give them hope as well, for whatever is written in earlier times was
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:56.380]   written for our instruction, so that through perseverance," that is a faithful, loyal obedience
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:04.040]   of the Word, "and the encouragement of Scriptures," sometimes the Word is there like the people
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.280]   in Hebrews chapter 11 who faced all kinds of obstacles by faith, "through the encouragement
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.320]   of Scriptures, we might have," what?
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.560]   We might have hope, right?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   That's right.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.880]   We face the encouragement that we might have hope.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:33.280]   And then skip down to verse 13.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:43.640]   It says, "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.840]   you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.240]   So notice how God is described here in verse 13.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.580]   He's described as the God of hope, and He's the one who fills you with all joy and peace.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.960]   That doesn't mean your circumstances change immediately.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.040]   In other words, some husbands and wives want to be able to say to you in counseling, "Well,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.160]   you give me a different circumstance in my marriage, Lord, and I'll be happy."
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:19.520]   No, no, no, that's not the way it happens.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.840]   Different circumstances are not going to make you happy if your heart's not happy, if your
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.120]   heart's not full of joy.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.180]   The joy comes on the inside.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:38.480]   Just yesterday, I was working with a woman in Texas who's getting her certification for
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:45.440]   counseling, and she's working with a woman in her church that is really unhappy in her
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   marriage.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.320]   She's unhappy, she's extremely dissatisfied with what's happening, and certainly her husband
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:56.340]   is no saint, there's no doubt about that.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.000]   He's got his own problems.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   But her unhappiness in marriage goes way back.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.040]   In fact, five years prior to this, the same woman had had an affair with the pastor of
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.880]   the church there, and of course, the pastor was removed from ministry, he's no longer
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.680]   in the ministry any longer.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.680]   He was reconciled to his wife, and this woman was reconciled to her husband, but five years
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.600]   down the line, one of the interesting things about this is the very heart motivation that
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.220]   fueled her adultery in the past was still present.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.840]   She stopped the external behavior of adultery, but the unhappiness and dissatisfaction in
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:50.400]   her marriage was still there because she defined her unhappiness as primarily being her husband.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.200]   This is the reason why I'm unhappy.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.960]   You change my husband, I have a better husband, I'll be a happy person.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.920]   The Apostle Paul says, "Happiness does not come in a change of circumstances.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:09.780]   Happiness comes as a result of the Holy Spirit bringing peace and joy to the heart."
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.380]   Same thing's true here.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:19.320]   Verse 13 of Romans 15, "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy in believing."
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.720]   You see, we've got to believe the truth so that you will abound in hope by power of the
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.660]   Holy Spirit.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.160]   This was the problem with the children of Israel.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.040]   The children of Israel, wandering through the wilderness thought, "You change our circumstances,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.240]   you change our surroundings, and we'll be happy.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.740]   Put us in the promise land," and God says, "No, no, that's not it at all.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.960]   Happiness begins in the heart.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   That's where it begins.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.620]   I can still put you in the promise land, the land of milk and honey, and you could still
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.960]   be unhappy."
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.560]   So you're not going to go there.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.240]   So they all died in the wilderness.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:04.400]   They said, "Change our circumstances," or, "Change my wife," or, "Change my husband,
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   and I'll be happy.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.520]   I'll be a happy person."
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.400]   And God says, "No, you change your heart."
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.200]   That's what makes you a happy person, a joyful person, a person who's at peace.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.040]   "Now, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you will
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.960]   abound in hope."
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   How?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   "By the change of circumstances," He said.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   "No, no, no, no.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.440]   By the power of the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.460]   It's the Spirit of God who brings that in the inner man.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.520]   You've got to be at peace with what God is doing in your life and not believe somehow
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.600]   you're living, in your marriage, God's second best for your life.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.640]   You are not living God's second best.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.840]   The only time you live God's second best is when you're not obeying Him.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.840]   It's the only time you are.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.240]   In fact, you're not even...that's not even God's second best.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   That's probably...when you're not obeying Him, you're living Satan's first best.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.200]   So there's a lack of hope, and there are a lot of marriages that have a lack of hope.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.040]   Secondly, second thing, there's also a lack of inclination.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.560]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.760]   That is, there is an unwillingness to change.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.000]   Why has there been no change?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.460]   Some of that comes from the fact that there is no hope.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:37.120]   Some of it comes from the fact that there is no willingness to change in their heart.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.840]   Now why does that happen?
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.360]   Because they believe that the change is too costly.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.720]   They have to give up something.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.000]   Maybe it's freedom, or it's money, or it's their dreams.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.640]   They have to give up something in order for this change to occur, and they think in the
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.360]   depths of their heart that that is far too costly for me.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:08.600]   I can't do that.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:15.000]   For example, do you know that some people become incredibly comfortable in their self-pity?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.520]   It becomes their lifestyle.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.440]   They live in self-pity, and they're very comfortable in living self-pity.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:27.520]   And to give that self-pity up, it's not worth it for them.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:35.080]   They would have to radically change to give that self-pity up.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.540]   And they don't want to give that up.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.680]   They want to feel sorry for themselves, and they want other people to feel sorry for them.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   They don't want to give it up.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.040]   They wallow in their self-pity, and they go from person to person talking about all their
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.160]   problems and how difficult it is to live with so-and-so, with their particular spouse.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.360]   You know how hard it is, and people say, "Oh, I feel so sorry for you."
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   They're not helping them.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.940]   They're encouraging them in their sinfulness by doing that.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.380]   It's too costly.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:19.420]   Let's go over to Matthew chapter 19, and we're interested in verse 16.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:26.060]   It's a great passage.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.380]   This is the problem here with the rich young ruler.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:37.280]   "And someone came to him and said, 'Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may inherit
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.740]   eternal life?'"
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.560]   Wow.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.380]   Most people would have thought today, your average evangelical would say, "I can't believe
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.720]   somebody's coming and asking me how to be a Christian.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   That's wonderful.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.340]   Let me give them the four spiritual laws and pronounce a benediction over them and lead
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.460]   them to Christ, and everything's going to be happy."
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.100]   Jesus saw through this.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.840]   "And he said to them, 'Why are you asking me about what is good?
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.200]   There's only one who is good, but if you wish to enter life, keep the commandments.'
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.520]   And then he said to them, 'Which ones?'
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.800]   And Jesus said, 'You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.040]   steal, you shall not bear false witness, honor your father and mother, and you shall love
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.720]   your neighbor as yourself.'"
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.280]   In other words, you're to love others as passionately as you already love yourself is the idea.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.080]   "And the young man said to him, 'All these things I have kept, and I am still lacking.'"
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.480]   Well, number one, that's a lie.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.520]   If he was really truly honest, he hasn't kept these things.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.280]   But Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions, give
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.680]   it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   Come and follow me."
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   Well, you know, that was pretty good because he opened up that last command, "If you love
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:57.160]   your neighbor as yourself," he said, "Well, you know what?
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.040]   I love my neighbor just as passionately as I love myself, so it's going to be very easy
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.800]   to give my money away and give it to the poor.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   It shouldn't be any problem."
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:13.240]   "When the young man heard the statement, he went away grieving, for he was one who owned
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.800]   much property."
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:28.420]   This guy loved himself way more than he loved his neighbor.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:34.240]   No problem with his self-esteem, or as my kids used to say when they were little, "Selfish
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   steam."
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:41.600]   There's no problem there.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.440]   So what do you need to do here?
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:52.200]   The counseling emphasis here, you need to show them what is motivating their heart that
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.360]   is not of God.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   That's what Jesus does here in Matthew 19.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.880]   What is motivating their heart that's not of God?
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:17.080]   Mark 14 and verse 25 says, "Now large crowds were going along with him," speaking of Jesus,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.320]   "and he turned and said to them, 'If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.560]   and mother, wife, and children, and brothers and sisters, yes, even his own life, he cannot
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.360]   be my disciple.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.760]   Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.'"
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:40.960]   Wow.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:47.040]   Now Jesus was not saying that we need to go around literally hating, but our love for
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   God should be so great that our love for everyone else should almost look like hate by comparison.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:04.120]   Our love for God trumps, our love for our Lord trumps every other human relationship,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.640]   everything else.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.520]   It's a much higher priority, and in fact, it's actually our love for God that helps
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.240]   us to understand how we should love our husbands and our wives and our children and our friends
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:30.080]   and our neighbors properly, and loving ourselves less, not more, less.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:39.880]   So we've got to speak to heart issues, show them the idols of their heart.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.080]   So there could be a lack of hope.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.160]   There could be a lack of willingness to change.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.920]   And then thirdly, there could also be, why are they not changing when it comes to counseling?
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:02.320]   A lack of information, meaning they think it's unnecessary to change because they don't
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.560]   see the problem.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.440]   They can be blind to the hurts and the needs of their husband or wife, or they do not see
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:16.760]   the harmful consequences of refusing to change, somehow they don't see it.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:23.480]   They don't have the proper information to see it.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:29.880]   They refuse to change the status quo.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.920]   What's the reason behind that?
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:39.080]   Well, this has to do with willful or passive ignorance.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:48.000]   They do not see the need to work on their marriage because of this ignorance.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.440]   Willful ignorance is they have the opportunity to learn and study the Word of God and sit
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.680]   under good teaching and preaching, and they refuse to do it.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.640]   Passive ignorance is maybe they are in a church that they're not taught well, and because
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.920]   they're not taught well, they just don't know.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.880]   They think they know, but they don't.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.760]   Passive ignorance.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.520]   And so, they don't see the real need to work on their marriage.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.920]   There's something else that's more important in their life than that.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.760]   What's the counseling emphasis then?
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.800]   Then you need to help them see their problems from a biblical perspective, challenge their
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.120]   pride, encourage the need for a teachable spirit.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:49.360]   They may think they know, and they really don't.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:59.060]   Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 11, here the writer of Hebrews says, "Concerning him we have much
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.020]   to say that is of Christ, and it's hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing,
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:08.220]   for though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need again for someone to teach you the
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.140]   elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:20.260]   food for everyone who partakes only of milk, is not accustomed to the word of righteousness,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.880]   for he is an infant, but solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:32.320]   senses trained to discern good and evil."
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:47.160]   Now the idea here is that if this is a willful ignorance, then like the early Hebrew Christians
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:54.040]   who have become dull of hearing, they need to be challenged to turn around and to seek
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:00.320]   solid food, more in depth teaching from the word of God about their marriage and how to
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.920]   deal with their problems.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:17.160]   Or we could also go over to James chapter 4 and verse 6, "But he gives a greater grace,
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.900]   therefore it says God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble, submit therefore
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.560]   to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you, draw near to God and he will draw
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:31.360]   near to you, cleanse your hands, you sinners," that's the outer man, "and purify your hearts,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.600]   you double-minded," that's the inner man, "be miserable and mourn and weep, let your
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.960]   laughter be turned into mourning and joy to gloom, humble yourselves in the presence of
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   the Lord and he will exalt you."
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:52.100]   So there has to be a certain amount of humility in order to be teachable, and that's what
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   they need.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:27:03.020]   They need to be humble, they need to be teachable, they need to change outwardly and inwardly.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.240]   So there can be a lack of hope, there can be an unwillingness to change, there can be
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.180]   an issue of ignorance that goes on and that's the reason why they're not changing.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:19.500]   Or fourth and last of all, there could also be a lack of skill, an awful lot of Christians
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.300]   are in this camp and they don't realize they're in this camp.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.580]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.660]   They don't know how to communicate and solve problems, forgiveness, they don't know the
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.660]   forgiveness process for reconciliation.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:39.480]   They don't even know how to, in a sense, exegete their own heart and what's going on in terms
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:49.180]   of bitterness and resentment and anger and all those sinful things that tend to swirl
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.740]   in the cauldron of the heart.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.820]   So they don't know how to do that, and you may have to spend time in counseling showing
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   them how to do that.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:05.900]   We'll talk about that a little bit later on in this class.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:16.220]   The reason, there's poor biblical training usually, preaching that's unrelated to life
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:24.140]   or they're in a good church but they've refused to apply the truth.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.460]   That's the whole point behind the little parable that Jesus uses at the end of the Sermon on
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:39.860]   the Mount there in Matthew chapter 7 when he talks about
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.300]   the parable of the man who builds his house upon the rock and the man who builds his house
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.980]   upon the sand.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:54.180]   He says, "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and acts upon them may be compared
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:29:00.180]   to a wise man that built his house upon a rock, who hears it and acts upon it.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.660]   And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against the house
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.660]   yet it did not fall for it had been founded upon a rock.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.720]   Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act upon them will be like a foolish
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.820]   man who built his house upon the sand.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.860]   The rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against the house and
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.140]   it fell and it great was its fall."
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   Sometimes I'll do it like this, I have a whiteboard when I'm counseling and up on that whiteboard
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:41.380]   I'll just draw a little illustration of this.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:51.700]   That's a house, okay?
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   And that's a house.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:03.060]   We're going to call this house number 1 and we're going to call this house number 2.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.340]   And I'll put up here your life.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.820]   Which one is your life?
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.620]   Now on the surface what is the difference between these two houses?
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.500]   Nothing, there's no difference.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.540]   There are a lot of people who come to church that are like that.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:27.060]   You can't tell the difference between a person who is really being faithful to the Lord and
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   one who is not being faithful to the Lord because they both look the same on the surface.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.660]   Well how do we know the difference between the two of them?
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.900]   Well the answer is it's what's below the surface that's going on here.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:53.700]   Because they both have houses that seem to be solid and probably you've heard of that
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.860]   little children's song, "Oh the wise man build his house upon the rock, foolish man build
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.620]   his house upon the sand" and so on and so on.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.780]   I'm not going to sing that for you.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.400]   The problem with the song is it misses the whole key to the parable and we need to write
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.180]   a whole new verse to the song.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.780]   It's a bad song because it misses the whole point.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:19.620]   The whole key to the parable is not the house, it's not the whole key to it.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.860]   The whole key to the parable actually is not the rock, that's not his point.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:31.180]   By the way, what is the rock?
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.160]   Jesus Christ, be a little bit more precise.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:42.620]   All right, the teaching of Christ within context is teaching, right?
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:59.060]   So that's the rock and the point is house number one has what?
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.180]   That anchors it to the rock.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:10.740]   Yeah, absolutely, a foundation.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:16.540]   House number two has no foundation whatsoever.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:24.380]   Now the critical thing about the little parable is what is the foundation?
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.380]   What is it?
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.380]   Sand?
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.660]   Well, I mean, what is the foundation of house number one?
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.580]   Pardon me?
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:40.060]   No, the rock's not the foundation.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:49.340]   What's the foundation of house number one?
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:55.340]   Yes, the hearing and acting.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:04.500]   The practice of the truth.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.700]   What's that?
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.740]   The practice of the truth.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.980]   In other words, I hear the truth, this person hears the truth, but they don't put it into
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.980]   practice.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.060]   This person puts it into practice.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.220]   This person obeys it.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.520]   Now how do we find out the difference between these two houses?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:33.300]   The answer is when the difficulties and storms of life come in and start to beat upon the
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.620]   house.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.420]   And what happens when the storms of life come?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:49.900]   Actually, the Luke passage in Luke 6 is very specific about it.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:59.940]   The moment, it says, the storm strikes the house, it falls and its destruction is complete.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.860]   In other words, it is a mess.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.140]   It falls apart like a house of cards.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.820]   Why?
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:16.780]   Because they heard the word, but they did not put it into practice.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.960]   And there are an awful lot of marriages that are like that.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.660]   They hear the word of God and they may be, they sit under great teaching, great preaching,
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.620]   but they refuse to put it into practice.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:34.100]   It doesn't change them as husbands, it doesn't change them as wives, doesn't change them
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:40.540]   as parents, doesn't change them as children, none of that is affected.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:48.820]   And the question is here, for our counselee is, which is your life?
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.500]   Because right now, your life looks like this, they've come with all their marital problems
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.880]   and all their struggles and all the difficulties, that's the storm.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.100]   And right now, everything is in a heap and rubble.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   Why?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.280]   What's the difference?
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.580]   The difference is they have not obeyed the truth.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:16.080]   They've heard the truth both here, they hear it, but this one puts it into practice.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.280]   This one obeys it.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.680]   There's the difference.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.120]   When there's a lack of skill, they have to be challenged to obey the truth.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.060]   So what do you want to emphasize in counseling?
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:34.840]   You want to emphasize good training, biblical communication, conflict resolution, roles,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.040]   parenting skills.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.320]   You want to help them understand this from Scripture, help them identify what is it in
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.720]   their heart that tends to rule and reign that's not of God.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:57.760]   Those are heart idols, and we'll talk about those heart idols later.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.040]   What's going on in those people's lives?
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.520]   So why are they not changing?
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.720]   Why are they not growing?
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:13.320]   Well, that's part of the reason, yes, Roger.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.640]   >> In their life, it's not as if, well, I just haven't been taught, it's that they haven't
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.120]   acted on the teaching?
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:28.840]   >> Well, if they've had poor biblical training, they're still culpable because they can still
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.520]   study the Scriptures on their own and learn it.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.760]   And for some reason, they haven't.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.640]   So I believe that there's still culpability even though they may be in a very poor or
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.440]   weak church, and they've got to renounce that.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.400]   And usually, you'll find even if they've been in a weak church, even what they have learned
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.200]   that is good hasn't been put into practice.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   So there's a certain element of culpability there as well.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:05.280]   >> If there's a point where you find out, "Hey, they're not receiving good teaching,"
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.680]   do you think it's, if you're counseling them either on behalf of another church or maybe
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.240]   through the Master's College, something like that, is there a point where you recommend
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   them to a good church?
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   And at what point does that principle come into play so it's not just sheep stealing
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   and that sort of thing?
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   But it's a legitimate benefit if you would do that.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:31.000]   John asked the question, "If you're counseling someone that's not of your church in a different
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.280]   kind of context, and you find out that they're going to a church that's really not teaching
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.800]   the Word of God well, what do you do?
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.880]   How do you handle that?"
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.840]   Well, first of all, I want to find out whether or not the church is willing to accept its
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.580]   responsibility to shepherd these people.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:52.040]   If they are and they're teachable, then I'll invite them, even if I'm a, and I used to
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:57.080]   do this as a pastor in my own church, I would invite a leader or a pastor of that church
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.120]   to come and sit in on the counseling so that they could learn how to do this.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   And then eventually take our counseling class if necessary.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.400]   And if they're willing to do that, that's great.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.280]   But if they're not willing to do that and they're not willing to sit in, then it communicates
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.000]   to me that not only do they have poor teaching, but they're not even interested in changing
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.360]   and growing themselves as a church.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.840]   So I'm going to say to them, "Listen, get out of that church and you find a church that's
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   serious."
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.760]   On paper, on paper, their doctrinal statement may be really good, but they don't practice
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.320]   it and they don't live by it.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:33.200]   So you get out of that church, you get to a church that practices their doctrinal statement.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.360]   They do it.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:41.920]   And I've asked, you know, I've suggested or counseled counselees that have gotten out
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   of pretty decent evangelical churches because they're not interested in practicing the truth.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:52.520]   Get into a church that's serious about your growth into holiness and Christ-likeness and
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.860]   it'll change you.
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:02.640]   So yeah, I don't hesitate to tell them to do that because for their welfare, if that
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:11.080]   church is not teaching them and emphasizing their growth in Christ, then what good is
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.480]   it that they're there?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.520]   That's probably one of the things, it's a contributing factor, it's not the sole reason
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.040]   for their marital problems, but it certainly is a contributing factor to their marital
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   problems.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.440]   All right, we've just covered four areas.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.360]   Why is it that people are not changing and growing through counseling situations?
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.760]   And we said one of the reasons is that they have no hope.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.780]   Another reason is because there is an unwillingness for them to change.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.320]   Another reason is they don't see the necessity of changing.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.080]   And then the last reason is because they really don't know how to.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.560]   They've never developed the skill, the ability to be able to do it.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.480]   And so you need to teach them how.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:59.700]   And that's the reason why we emphasized practicing the truth, putting the word into active obedience
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.920]   in a person's life.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.500]   Now, this brings us to number 10.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.000]   Number 10, as you interact with the people and reflect upon the data that you're gathering,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.120]   you will have to decide on the best way to approach these people, all right?
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.300]   How do you approach them?
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.620]   And there's a couple of passages I want you to take a look at just real quickly.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.600]   One is 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, verse 14.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:27.920]   1 Thessalonians 5, verse 14, which really presents to us the question, "What kind of
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:36.160]   person am I dealing with here?"
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.400]   Paul says, "We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly."
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.000]   So the first group is the unruly people.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.800]   These are the type of people who are undisciplined in their life or they lack self-control in
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.440]   their life.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.320]   "Encourage the fainthearted."
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.480]   So there's something different we do with fainthearted.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.440]   "Help the weak.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.640]   Be patient with every man."
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.960]   Of course, you don't want to help the unruly or encourage the unruly.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.360]   No, no, no.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.020]   You need to admonish them.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:14.520]   And that word "admonish" is our word that we've talked about before, "nuthetao,"
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:21.760]   which is that combined word in the Greek of a noun and a verb.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:28.880]   "Nus" is mind, "tithemi" is the verb, which means to place or to put into the mind.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.300]   And so the idea is when you admonish, you're actually placing or putting sense into the
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   mind.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.540]   That's the reason why it's a real good word to translate it, "counsel."
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.780]   You counsel the unruly.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.840]   You place sense into the mind of the unruly and the undisciplined.
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.140]   You encourage the fainthearted.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.140]   You help the weak.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.120]   You're patient with everyone.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.700]   So you have to decide, "What do I need to do?
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.920]   Should I admonish them?
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   Should I encourage them?
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   Should I help them?"
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.620]   In order to do that, you've got to know who you're dealing with.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:03.360]   And, of course, then he says, "Be patient with everyone, all people, whoever they are,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.820]   whether they're unruly or fainthearted or weak.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.320]   Be patient with them."
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.340]   That's true of all, everybody that you counsel.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.940]   Then let's go back to the Old Testament.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:22.240]   Let's go back to Proverbs 9, verse 7.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:29.780]   Here Solomon is talking about actually wisdom in chapter 9, and he's talking about lady
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.660]   wisdom in contrast to lady folly.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:43.820]   And lady wisdom offers an invitation to her feast, and lady folly does the same thing
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.420]   beginning in verse 13.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:54.380]   But back in verse 7, it says, "He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and he
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.340]   who reproves a wicked man gets insults for himself.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:01.900]   Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.220]   Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.060]   Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.140]   Teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.780]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.780]   So what are we dealing with?
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:22.260]   Are we dealing with a fool, a scoffer, or are we dealing with a wise man?
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.000]   What kind of a person are we dealing with?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.740]   Because that affects how we approach them.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.540]   How are you going to deal with these people?
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.540]   Yes, Ruben.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:35.980]   >> Actually, today I was talking with some friends about this verse, and we would like
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:43.100]   to know what the proverbs mean by a scoffer.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.100]   >> Someone who mocks God or His Word.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.540]   >> So somebody who...
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.860]   >> In behavior or in language.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.100]   >> Obviously a Christian can do that.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.420]   >> No, I think there's a time where a Christian can do that.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.780]   A Christian can scoff God.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:13.020]   I think that Peter does that when he rebukes Jesus for saying that he must suffer and that
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.620]   he's going to be rejected by the scribes and the Pharisees.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:21.000]   Jesus, in a sense, Peter rebukes him for that.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.220]   He scoffs at that idea.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.780]   And that's where Jesus turns and says to him, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:32.300]   Well, that's right after Peter's just made this declaration, "Oh, by the way, you are
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   the Christ."
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.100]   All right, right after he makes that declaration, then Jesus says, "Yes, that's right.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.700]   I'm the Christ, and the Christ, the Messiah, must suffer rejection at the hands of men.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:51.140]   The Pharisees, the scribes, chief priests are going to reject me."
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.100]   Peter says, "No, Lord, that can't be.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.740]   That's not my view of the Messiah."
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:06.820]   So on one hand, Peter's giving this wonderful...he's acclaiming Christ to be the Christ, and on
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:12.640]   the other hand, he turns right around and mocks Jesus and says, "That can't be.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   You got it all wrong."
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:22.140]   >> When Peter said that, Jesus somehow corrected him, right?
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.500]   He said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   >> Oh, yes.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.500]   He did correct him at that particular time.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.100]   >> So how could we understand that like Proverbs 9, 7, when it says they want to correct a
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   scoffer?
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.820]   >> Because it's like Proverbs 13, 15 says, "The way of the transgressor is hard."
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:46.020]   In other words, there will be a time where even a believer can, I believe, transgress
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.980]   and actually be a scoffer.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:53.060]   Now, mostly, I agree with what you're saying, mostly the people that are going to scoff
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.260]   God are going to be unbelievers.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.940]   But is it possible for a time that a believer can act like an unbeliever?
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.940]   Yes.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:05.620]   >> What I meant was more like in Proverbs 9, it seems like it is worthless to correct
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.300]   a scoffer, right?
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:08.300]   >> Yes.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   Because they're not teachable.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   That's right.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.100]   Only a wise person is going to be teachable.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.900]   It's worthless to correct a scoffer because they're not teachable.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.900]   Michael.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:27.140]   >> So what would the proper response be like to a scoffer, knowing that they're not teachable?
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:32.020]   >> One of the things that I love to do is take them back to Proverbs 1, and beginning
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.480]   in verse...
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.860]   One of the ways you deal with a scoffer is you take them over to Proverbs 1, and beginning
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:47.700]   in verse 24, he says, "Because I called you and you refused to stretch out my hand and
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:52.900]   no one paid attention, you neglected all my counsel, you did not want my reproof."
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:59.380]   So earlier, the scoffer scoffs at God, then God says, "I will also laugh at your calamity,
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.180]   I will mock when your dread comes, when your dread comes like a storm and your calamity
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.740]   comes like whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you, then they will call on me,
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   but I will not answer.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.620]   They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me."
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.620]   What's God saying?
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.340]   "I'm going to let you suffer the consequences of your sin.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.420]   I'm going to let you suffer that.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.540]   You're going to scoff my counsel, then..."
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.340]   In fact, he talks about the scoffer up in verse 22, "You're going to do that?
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.340]   You're going to scoff my counsel?
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.100]   Then I'm going to let you suffer the consequences of your sin."
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:36.180]   That's why later on, Proverbs 13, 15, the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.580]   Proverbs 13, 21, adversity pursues sinners.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.260]   Now generally, I'm in full agreement with what Reuben's saying.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.340]   The person who's really the overall scoffer is an unbeliever.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.580]   It's true.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.740]   That's exactly right.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.420]   Now, for a time, can a Christian act like an unbeliever?
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   Yes.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.460]   Can he even scoff at the things of God?
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.460]   Yes.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.780]   He can do that, but it'll only be for a time.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:07.420]   Then he's going to repent and turn around, especially, well, you get an example of that
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:15.020]   like in 1 Corinthians 5, you've got the man who committed adultery with his stepmother,
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.020]   and he refused to be admonished for it.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:25.420]   He scoffed at the admonishment, and Paul says, in a sense, excommunicate him, put him out
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:29.380]   of the church, turn him over to Satan, he says, for the destruction of the flesh that
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.020]   his soul might be saved.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:39.060]   And then by the time we get to 2 Corinthians 2, the guy repents.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:48.400]   He eventually shows himself to be a believer, but there was a time when he was committing
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:57.220]   this adultery or fornication with his stepmother where he did not act like he was a believer.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:03.180]   Later on, he repents, he turns around, he changes.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:14.860]   So here in Proverbs 9, verses 7 through 10, we've got an example of a person who's a scoffer,
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.660]   and it sets in contrast the difference between the scoffer and the wise man.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:27.180]   By the way, Proverbs 9 is a key passage because it sets up, of all the chapters in the entire
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:33.660]   book of Proverbs, it sets up the entire book, because it illustrates what a life of wisdom
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.820]   is like, and it illustrates what a life of foolishness is like, and a contrast between
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.420]   the two, and it actually sets up the entire rest of the book.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.700]   Proverbs 9 is key there.
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   Proverbs 2 explains to us what wisdom and understanding is, but Proverbs 9 sets up the
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   contrast between the two lifestyles.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:50:00.620]   So number 11, "Then as you interact with people and reflect upon the data that you're gathering,
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.640]   you will have to decide on the best way to see these people."
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.500]   How are you going to deal with this?
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.820]   And this becomes a question, especially in marriage and family counseling, because you
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:21.740]   can counsel them individually, or sometimes we refer to that as concurrently.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.340]   When would you want to do that?
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:30.420]   Well, if a marriage has gotten to the point where it's so brutal, and it's so bad between
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.300]   them, and probably some of you that have been in ministry long enough by now have seen that
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:44.060]   kind of thing happen, and they're attacking each other, and that's their only way of interacting.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:49.180]   The only way they know how to interact with one another is just by attacking each other.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:53.940]   And getting them together is not the right thing to do here at first.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:59.860]   You're going to have to work with them individually at first and then put them back together again.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:04.220]   Or another reason you would want to meet with them individually, if one spouse fears the
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.620]   other spouse for one reason or another.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:12.840]   Maybe a physical fear, it may be a financial fear, it may be something like that that's
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:20.260]   out there, and there's just an inordinate fear of somebody has something on somebody,
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:26.580]   or threatens somebody with some kind of harm.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.900]   You may not be able to meet together.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:37.540]   Maybe a wife is fearful of her husband because he's a big brute, or maybe a husband is fearful
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:46.020]   of a wife because she's threatened to have him thrown in jail.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.740]   And the more you put them together, the worse it gets right now.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:56.340]   So you first have to meet with them separately, work on their attitudes towards God, their
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.940]   relationship to God, then their attitudes towards one another, their relationship with
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.980]   one another.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.260]   That has to happen first.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:16.100]   Or maybe there's one of the spouses that practices monopolizing all the time, and essentially
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:21.620]   excludes the other spouse from interacting.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:26.420]   I've seen husbands do that with wives, and I've seen wives do that with husbands.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:31.660]   Just a couple years ago, I had a, well, at least in my thinking, an infamous occasion
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.740]   of this where every time a husband opened his mouth to share anything in counseling,
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.820]   his wife would always revise it.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.420]   She would always revise it.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.380]   She'd say stuff like, "Well, you know what he means.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.980]   He means this."
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.940]   Or if he said something that she didn't like, she would act like it was really a stupid
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.940]   comment.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.940]   "Well, that's stupid.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.020]   That's a dumb.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.020]   That's dumb."
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.340]   So every time he opened his mouth, he was demeaned or revised.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.740]   And I talked about this earlier.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:09.340]   This is the type of, actually, this particular couple had come in because they weren't communicating
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.860]   well.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.340]   She was complaining that her husband wouldn't communicate with her.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:23.620]   Well, I know why, because every time he said something, it was always wrong.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.740]   That's the reason why he's not communicating.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:32.180]   Well, why would you meet with them individually?
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:39.060]   Well, sometimes, some spouses can be overly sensitive or timid about what the other spouse
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.140]   says or does.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.340]   And temporarily, you may have to meet with them separately.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.180]   They're overly sensitive or they're timid.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:56.500]   Or sometimes, there's a refusal to see the other side or to change with the other person
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.020]   present.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:04.880]   You may have to meet with them individually.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:10.700]   Or sometimes, there's a personal problem that they're unwilling to discuss in front of their
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:14.100]   spouse.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:19.040]   Maybe it's something of shame, and if they were to admit this in front of their spouse,
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.980]   it would be they would think that the world would come to an end.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.180]   This would be too shameful.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:30.100]   I can't handle this.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:37.660]   Or sometimes, there's been a misuse of information or instruction that is given concerning their
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:43.100]   spouse.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.140]   Maybe they've taken information that they've learned in counsel and they've gone out and
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.300]   shared it with other members of the family or extended members of the family or their
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:55:03.460]   father or mother, and it's now become detrimental to the counseling process.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:10.740]   Or you may meet with them individually as a prevention of their spouse from proper interaction.
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:16.500]   Or they're the ones, I should say, that actually prevent their spouse from proper interaction.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:23.080]   So you want to temporarily now pull them out of the equation.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.100]   Or there's a fragility of relationship that runs a great risk if you were to counsel them
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.100]   together.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.520]   Just things are so fragile.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:43.880]   I mean, it's almost as if this marriage is in intensive care, emergency room of the hospital,
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.880]   and the heart of this marriage, the chest of this marriage is cracked open, and the
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.960]   surgeon is massaging the heart to keep it going.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:56:01.920]   And one spouse is being brutal or uncaring, and the relationship is so fragile, it's ready
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.640]   to fall apart.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.360]   You may want to meet with them individually.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.200]   But again, let me emphasize that when you do that, you're stressing the fact that this
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:21.640]   is only temporary because long-term, meeting with them individually, they just get used
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   to that.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.120]   They don't get to solve their problems together, and they have to learn how to do that using
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   the Word of God.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   >> [inaudible]
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:41.000]   There's one spouse, a husband or a wife, that prevents their spouse from proper interaction.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Okay?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.400]   That's what's happening.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.520]   And number eight.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:58.600]   All right, you may say, "Okay, let's meet with them together."
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.960]   Instead of concurrently, you would meet conjointly.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.480]   This is where the couple comes together.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:09.240]   Now, this is better, and this is much more preferable in counseling.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:14.680]   This is what we're aiming at because when you meet with them together, it prevents gossip
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.120]   or a counselor's misinterpretation, misunderstanding.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:25.940]   In fact, it helps to correct any misconceptions you may have as a counselor.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.080]   You're getting both views.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:33.640]   You're getting both sides at the same time.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:40.720]   It helps to encourage accuracy and fullness of details of their marital interactions.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:47.440]   One spouse will remember something that occurred in more detail than the other spouse will.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:54.360]   And so, that helps you to get a more fuller picture of what's happening.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:58:04.880]   When they meet together, you also get an insight into how they interact or react to one another.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:15.920]   And as I said before, every marriage, everyone has a pattern of behavior, habits that they
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.000]   fall into.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.560]   Sometimes they're good habits.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.480]   Sometimes they're bad habits.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.840]   And you get to observe that when you're meeting with both of them together.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.440]   What kind of pattern of interacting have they formed?
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:37.680]   Fourthly, the counselor example can be used in the counseling context when you're meeting
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.920]   together, especially if you're married.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:48.320]   If you're married and you can use your own example, this is the way my wife would respond
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.760]   to me if I were to say something like this.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.360]   So, you can help the wife.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:59:01.980]   This is the way I should respond to my wife when this particular topic comes up.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.280]   You can use your own marriage as an example.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:09.880]   It also decreases the counselor's manipulation by one party because some people are really
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.440]   good at manipulation.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:19.520]   This is something they've practiced most of their life with their father or their mother
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:23.880]   or their friends or other people that they tend to know.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.920]   They're really good at manipulation.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.240]   And they may try to manipulate you, and you may be fooled by it.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.200]   I've been fooled by people many a times.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.720]   I tell them, "Listen, you can fool me, but you can't fool God."
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.960]   God sees everything that's going on.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:44.480]   Furthermore, meeting with them together is an opportunity to practice good communication
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:54.320]   principles, the opportunity for them to use the Word of God, and you now, or they become
[00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:00.840]   accountable to you in how well they're using those good communication principles.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.080]   A little bit later on in the class, we're going to talk about four rules of communication.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.160]   You teach couples, get them interacting and practicing good communication.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:16.680]   Number seven, there's an immediate problem solving under the supervision of the counselor.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.640]   Instead of allowing problems to fester and just get worse, you can actually begin to
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.520]   take steps to solving those problems right there immediately in front of both of them.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.360]   Number eight, it stresses unity and working on a common goal together.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.520]   That may be the first time in their marriage they've ever really done that.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.400]   Maybe it's been a hostile marriage.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:45.040]   Maybe it's been the kind of a marriage where it's been very competitive, but now they have
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:52.240]   to work as a team, not as combatants.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.800]   Or number nine, teaching, it becomes a teaching forum on how God-intended couples should honor
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:12.640]   Him through biblical problem-solving, how should they as a couple best honor God through
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.600]   biblical problem-solving.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.360]   So when you meet with them together, there's plenty of advantages.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:36.400]   It's just that in some circumstances, you may have to meet with them separately
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:47.000]   because the relationship is too fragile, because it's too volatile, and you've got to get them
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:55.760]   focused on pleasing God regardless of how their mate responds to them or fails to respond
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.820]   to them.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.760]   And then you put them back together again so they're thinking all the right things and
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.960]   doing all the right things, expecting all the right things.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:18.600]   All right, which brings us to then principle number 12 here that we want to highlight.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.560]   As you interact with people and reflect upon the data that you're gathering, you will have
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.520]   to decide what to do if only one person is strongly committed and willing to work on
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520]   their marriage.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.480]   What are you going to do if only one person is really strongly committed to working on
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.000]   this?
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:46.600]   Well, you have to discern the reason for each spouse's response.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.560]   Discern the reason for each spouse's response.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:57.600]   Maybe they think it's the other person's problem, they are mostly the innocent party, that maybe
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   they're thinking.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.360]   I'm mostly an innocent party.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   It's what they've done.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   It's what they've said.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:11.760]   You don't understand what they've done, they'll say to you as a counselor.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.840]   That's the reason why they're not really willing to change because they don't think that they
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.000]   need to change at all.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.280]   Fix my spouse.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.800]   That's what you need to do.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   Fix my spouse.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   That's the reason why I'm here.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   I want you to fix my spouse.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.960]   Well, I usually say to them, "Listen, you've been married for how long now?
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   15 years?"
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960]   "Yeah."
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.280]   "Have you been trying to change your spouse?"
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.280]   "Oh, yes."
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   "Has it worked?"
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   "No."
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   "Then don't expect me to try to change them either."
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   "I can't do that.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.580]   You've been trying to do it for 15 years and it hasn't worked.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.320]   But there's one thing we can do, we can get you to change you.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320]   You can change."
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.680]   "Oh, well."
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.880]   Or they think it's no use, there's no amount of counseling that's really going to change
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   things.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:05.440]   And this is a person who's absolutely, totally lost all hope, which really calls into question
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.560]   the omnipotence of God.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:14.440]   God can't change things in my marriage.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.840]   Calls into question the sufficiency of the Word of God as well.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.800]   And as a believer, that's dangerous.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.420]   Or they want an excuse for getting out of the marriage and they will often sabotage
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.720]   the efforts made in counseling.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.880]   You will have people do this to you.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.820]   They'll come to marriage, but everything you...or they'll come to marriage counseling and everything
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:46.760]   that they do, in a sense, sabotages what you're attempting to do in counseling.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.060]   I remember years ago, at one point I was working with a couple and I sat back and I thought
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.300]   to myself, "Why is this not working?"
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:05:00.020]   In every other normal situation, this marital counseling should be working.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:06.020]   And it dawned on me, it was like God gave me special revelation.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:12.760]   He didn't, but it was just like God turned the floodlights on, boom.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:18.860]   This husband was coming to counseling because before he even ever entered counseling, he
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.820]   had decided to get out of this marriage and the only reason he was coming was because
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:31.220]   he wanted to be able to tell his family that he tried and it didn't work.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:36.620]   He wanted to save face after the divorce.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:44.980]   When that dawned on me, I'm going, "Whoosh, I know why he's here and I know why he's sabotaging
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.040]   everything.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.000]   He doesn't want it to work.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.020]   His mind, his life is already way past this."
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.220]   You say, "Well, did you confront him on it?"
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.660]   "Oh, yes, I did.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.100]   I certainly did."
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:09.840]   And when I confronted him on it, both he and his wife were stunned.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:17.140]   They were stunned that I said anything about it, but everything added up in that direction.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.060]   And that was a turning point in the marriage counseling.
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:31.380]   He hung his head in that counseling session and he said, "That's right, that's right.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.460]   I've already planned to divorce her.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.380]   My girlfriend's waiting until this happens.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:43.780]   We plan on getting married, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da."
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.700]   So the only reason you're here is because you want to save face in front of your family.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   Is that it?
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.700]   Do you realize how wicked that is?
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   You're a liar.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.420]   By coming here, you were saying to me, "I want to work on my marriage," but that's not
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.180]   what you really came for.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.940]   You came to get an excuse.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:12.940]   And that guy broke into tears.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:17.900]   Because I think it was the first time that all of his wickedness, of his sinful inclinations
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.540]   and purposes and plans were all laid out on the table.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.180]   And of course, his wife was devastated because she was hoping with all of her heart that
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.540]   they were really going to work on their marriage.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:39.460]   And now to hear that he was there with ulterior motives changed the whole dynamic.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:47.300]   But then when he began to repent, then it became really sweet.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.180]   But you have people do this to you.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:55.340]   They want to get out of their marriage and they'll sabotage every effort you make and
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.820]   you'll say to yourself, "Why is this not working?
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.660]   I don't understand why this is not working."
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.340]   Because somewhere, someone's not really been honest.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.340]   If I'm not sure about it, sometimes I'll say this.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:10.700]   You know, I'll say, "Tom, Mary, you know what?
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.220]   One of you acts to me like you want to get out of this marriage and you're only playing
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.060]   the game right now.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:23.940]   Tell me if I'm wrong."
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:33.020]   And they look like deer that have been caught in headlights, right?
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.260]   Why is this not working?
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:38.100]   Look, we've tried this and we've worked on this, we've worked on this.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.540]   From every biblical perspective I know of, this should be working but it's not.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.780]   So the problem is not in the truth of the Word of God, the problem is not in the counsel,
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.340]   the problem has got to be in you.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.660]   So what is the obstacle here?
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.820]   Why is this not working?
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.540]   You have to find that out.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.540]   Or here is another thing.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.220]   They've already decided on a divorce and they've gone to counseling in order to save face in
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220]   front of the family.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.220]   Well, that's what I was just talking about.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.180]   I didn't click it yet.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:18.420]   Or they've been involved in an affair whether declared or not and counseling is just a formality.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.780]   Or they've been involved in a power struggle with their spouse and they're not interested
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.100]   in giving an inch.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:34.860]   To save face means I stand where I stand and I'm not going to give an inch on this, which
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:40.220]   is an incredibly prideful position and certainly is not putting others before yourself, it's
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:47.340]   putting yourself up first and all has to go my way or it's not going to go any way.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.580]   It's that whole philosophy, it's my way or the highway.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.180]   And when people take hard and fast positions like that, you have good reason to begin to
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:03.260]   question whether or not these people are genuine believers.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:08.660]   When they take these hard and fast positions, it's my way or the highway.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:15.460]   I've got to have my way or nothing else is going to work and we've got major problems.
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:28.300]   Well, when only one spouse is willing to work on their problem, then what should your counseling
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.420]   emphasis or focus be?
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.580]   What should happen when that occurs?
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.980]   Well, if they think it's entirely the other person's problem, then you need to seek and
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:45.440]   illuminate the unwilling spouse.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.660]   Matthew 7, 1 through 6 has to do with the log and the splinter, remember?
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:59.300]   Jesus says there in the Sermon on the Mount, He talks about judging other people and it's
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:04.820]   very easy to pick the splinter or the speck out of the other person's eye.
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.060]   It's not the Greek word really for splinter.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.300]   They only use splinter because of the term log that's used there.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.300]   It's actually speck.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.620]   I really think it's a reference to floaties.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.940]   You know, have you ever had a floaty in your eye?
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.960]   A little piece of dust get in there and you can see it go across there.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.860]   Imagine if I came to you and said, "Here, let me pick that little floaty out of your
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.860]   eye."
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.420]   You'd say, "Get away from me."
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.540]   And all along, I have this gigantic log hanging out of my eye.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:33.400]   I mean, is that hyperbole or what?
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.580]   That is pure hyperbole.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:44.420]   Jesus is really stretching the analogy to the point that really makes a great point.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:51.740]   And that is we're really good at judging other people minutely, but we use a very, very loose
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.740]   judgment on ourselves.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:01.740]   So you need to find out why this has happened, and of course, Romans 12, 17 through 21 deals
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:08.920]   with the issue of don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.860]   That's our responsibility.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:20.180]   Furthermore, if they're hopeless, if both are Christians, then you must help them see
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.860]   that there is no marriage problems beyond God's help.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.740]   There's no marriage problems beyond God's help.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:31.020]   I think I've used this analogy before, but, you know, you need to help them to see, "Listen,
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:34.460]   this problem looks like a gigantic mountain in front of them, but they've got to be able
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:39.900]   to lift their eyes behind and above this mountain stands God.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.580]   This problem is not bigger than God.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.860]   It looks like a mountain.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:52.140]   It looks like it's almost insurmountable, but God who is there is their God, their Lord
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.960]   is bigger than this problem."
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.540]   This is that 1 Corinthians 10, 13 issue, "There is no temptation taking you except for what
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.420]   is common to man, and God is faithful.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:07.060]   He will not allow you to be tempted above what you're able."
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.960]   Or if they want an excuse, or if they've decided on a divorce, then explain biblical reasons
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:19.540]   for divorce, "All other divorce is willful sin," and let them know that how dangerous
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:24.720]   presumptuous willful sin is.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.060]   It's one thing to sin inadvertently.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.300]   That's a sin, and it's wrong before God, and something that need to be repented.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.260]   I'm not minimizing that at all.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:38.020]   However, the Bible does say that willful presumptuous sin has a special quality to it.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.580]   Let me illustrate it by taking you over to Psalm 19.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:54.060]   David here talks about presumptuous sin in verse 13.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.820]   He talks about inadvertent sin in verse 12, but presumptuous sin in verse 13, he says,
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:01.400]   "Also, keep back your servant from presumptuous sin."
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.880]   Those are very willful sins that people commit.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:11.420]   He says then, the very next phrase, "Let them not rule over me."
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:17.780]   Presumptuous sins have an unusual enslaving quality to them.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:25.980]   The same thing is what God said to Cain in Genesis chapter 4 and verse 7, "Why are you
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.980]   angry?
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.100]   Why is your face downcast?
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.060]   If you do what is right, will not your countenance be lifted up?
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.420]   But if you don't do what is right, sin is crouching at your door.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.020]   It desires to have you."
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:41.020]   The idea is it desires to master you, but you must master it.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:49.380]   Willful presumptuous sin has a mastering quality to it, an enslaving quality to it.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:55.660]   This is something that is going to dominate them and destroy their life.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:01.300]   If I see a spouse that is willing to walk out of counseling and go about and still get
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:07.260]   a divorce and practice willful sin, before they leave counseling, I'll at least repeat
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:10.660]   Proverbs 13, 15 a half dozen times, if not more.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:14.220]   By the way, Tom, do you know the way of the transgressor is hard?
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.940]   Then I'll talk and counsel for a while, and then I'll say, "By the way, Tom, did you know
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.780]   the Bible says the way of the transgressor is hard?"
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:25.580]   And you know, Tom, later on, the way of the transgressor is hard, I want that ringing
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:31.140]   in Tom's conscience as he goes out of there, so that later on when he goes about to sin,
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.740]   you know what he's going to remember?
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:42.700]   He's going to remember my voice saying, "Tom, the way of the transgressor is hard."
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.900]   And when times get tough in his life, he's going to remember, "The way of the transgressor
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:52.100]   is hard," or verse 21, "Adversity pursues sinners."
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.980]   Tom, things are going to get tough from here.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:16:00.780]   Do you know that I've had counselees come back to me five years after counseling, and
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:05.460]   they finally repented, changed their life, and things got really bad for them after they
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.620]   went out and participated in their sin?
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.700]   And they'll say to me, "Hey, you know, that last counseling, you remember that last counseling?"
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.420]   "Oh, yeah, I remember it."
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.980]   We had, "Well, did you know that I hated what you said to me?"
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:22.100]   I said, "Oh, yeah, it was pretty evident."
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:28.420]   But you know, that's the thing that worked on my conscience over the past five years.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.280]   That's why I'm back.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.700]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.620]   It's hard.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   It's going to get tough.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:42.900]   Life's going to get tough, and that's what they'll remember every time life gets tough.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.900]   They think they're running from their problems when in reality, they're carrying all their
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:50.680]   problems inside in a neat little package called a wicked heart.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.340]   That's where all their problems is.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.740]   They think they're getting away from their problems by getting out of that marriage,
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.340]   when in reality, they're carrying all their problems with them into that whatever that
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:05.760]   new relationship is.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.280]   The seeds of the destruction of future relationships is already there and sown in their heart.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.020]   Well number four, if number five above, that is, they've been involved in an affair, repentance
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.180]   and recommitment to making their marriage work for Christ's sake has got to be the key
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.300]   here.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:29.420]   That is, if their spouse will take them back, and if their spouse is willing to forgive
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:35.280]   them, then they should take them back.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.900]   Forgiveness entails reconciliation.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:46.060]   In fact, forgiveness is actually the first step in the broader reconciliation process.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:53.480]   So if they're willing to forgive, they will take them back.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.500]   Number five, then if number six above, that mean they've been involved in a power struggle
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:03.540]   in the relationship, then submission to Christ will resolve in repentance and a humble spirit
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:09.940]   towards their spouse.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:31.820]   Submission to Christ will result in a humble spirit towards their spouse.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:48.900]   Now, if then in counseling you have done everything that you can do to get your unwilling person
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:57.580]   involved in the counseling process and they still resist, then the following principles
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.060]   are true.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:14.860]   Grab your Bible, let's go over to Matthew chapter 10 and verse 34.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.140]   Jesus says, "Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:22.500]   I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.500]   For I came to set man against father, daughter against mother, daughter-in-law against her
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:32.860]   mother-in-law, a man's enemies will be members of his own household.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:36.200]   He who loves father and mother more than me is not worthy of me.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.540]   He who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:44.220]   He who does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.180]   He who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for my sake will
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180]   find it."
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:58.420]   In fact, if one spouse determines to live for the Lord and it alienates the other spouse,
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:04.460]   this is what Jesus is talking about, then you can't help it.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.860]   Sometimes that's going to occur.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:16.980]   Let's go over to Romans 12, Matthew 10, 34 through 39, in Romans 12, we're interested
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:25.580]   in verse 18, "So the spouse that is the honorable spouse, the one that stays and wants to make
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:31.540]   the marriage work, the one that wants to do things God's way, no matter what, they need
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.860]   to practice this with the spouse who's unwilling to reconcile."
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.220]   Verse 18, "If possible, so far as it depends upon you, be at peace with all men."
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.980]   Sometimes it is possible, sometimes it's not, but he says if it is possible.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:53.180]   "So far as it depends upon you," sometimes it doesn't depend upon you, but as far as
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:57.340]   it does, "be at peace with all men.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.460]   Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.900]   written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.780]   But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he's thirsty, give him a drink, for in doing
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:14.420]   so you will heap burning coals on his head,'" which was ancient warfare terminology.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.420]   What does that mean?
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:19.260]   Verse 21, "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:27.360]   In other words, instead of heaping on coals, you're heaping on good to that person.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:33.100]   You're heaping on good.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.740]   And then, of course, there's the principle there in 1 Peter chapter 3, verses 1 through
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.740]   9.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:44.180]   We're going to talk about this a little bit later in the class, but 1 Peter 3 is actually
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:51.340]   written to Christian spouses who are married primarily to unbelieving spouses.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:56.580]   In verse 1, it refers to wives married to unbelieving husbands, or at least husbands
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.460]   who act like unbelievers.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:07.220]   In verse 7, it's written to Christian husbands that are married to unbelieving wives within
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.100]   context that are bringing hardship into their lives.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:16.820]   So within this context, you take a look at verses 8 and 9, then it says, "To sum up,"
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:21.340]   after addressing the husband and wife, he says, "All of you," all husbands and wives,
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:27.140]   "be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit, not returning evil for
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:31.660]   evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead, for you were called for the very
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.140]   purpose that you might inherit a blessing."
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.780]   Now, this is what you say to the spouse who's willing to work on this.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:46.460]   "Then I always have them memorize 1 Peter 4.19, 'Therefore, those who suffer according
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:54.820]   to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right.'"
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.580]   That becomes their marching orders.
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:04.620]   "Those who suffer according to the will of God should commit themselves or entrust their
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:10.740]   souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right."
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:14.260]   That's what should be happening.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.300]   So that is, if you've done everything you can in order to get the unwilling person involved
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:23.940]   and they still resist, then you need to confront the unwilling person with Matthew 10 and then
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:30.820]   help the willing spouse with Romans 12 and 1 Peter 3, 1 through 9, to teach them how
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:36.780]   to live and respond to their spouse that's not willing to handle things God's way.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:42.100]   Now, number 13, "Then as you interact with people and reflect upon the data that you're
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.500]   gathering, you will have to decide what to do if only one person is strongly committed
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.740]   and willing to come to counseling."
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.740]   What are you going to do?
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:56.580]   Well, don't assume when that happens that you always hear the full story.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.380]   You're only getting one side of the story.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:01.260]   According to Proverbs 18, 17, that's kind of dangerous.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.900]   So always assume there's more to the story than what they're telling you, no matter how
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.460]   well-intended that spouse may be.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:16.820]   Ask the willing person why their spouse thinks that it's the other person's fault.
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:22.100]   That's a good way to get a little bit of information from the other perspective.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.580]   Ask them why their spouse hasn't been available for biblical counseling.
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.340]   Why is that?
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:33.280]   Ask them why they think it's no use to make the effort of counseling.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:39.060]   Why is there no use to make the effort for counseling?
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:45.900]   Ask them why they've been involved in the affair outside of marriage.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:55.580]   Did you drive them into the arms of another man or woman by your attitudes, by your actions?
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:02.340]   Ask them why they've been in a power struggle with their mate.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:04.700]   Why have they been in a power struggle with their mate?
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:20.760]   Which reflects on all the things that we just talked about earlier.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:27.700]   Why has that gone on?
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.860]   So you need to gather data.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.180]   If you don't have the other spouse there, then there are other ways that you could probably
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:42.560]   get at some of this data and have a more full view of it.
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:53.340]   Furthermore, you need to write, call, email, instant message the spouse that refuses to
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.660]   attend.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:26:01.660]   Let them know that they are welcome anytime.
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:09.820]   Make sure they know they are welcome anytime to be a part of this process.
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:16.620]   And then, you're supposed to work with the person that will come.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:24.060]   And one of the things that you can do indirectly is to encourage the counselee to share, you
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:29.060]   got to be careful with the teaching part, but share what they have learned with their
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.100]   spouse.
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.980]   If the spouse is open and receptive to hear and sometimes these spouses are very curious
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:36.980]   because they haven't been there.
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:41.620]   They're very curious about what's happened in the counseling.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:47.620]   And counseling is not there to run down the spouse that's not present.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:53.620]   Counseling is there to work on the spouse that is there, is present, to work on their
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.020]   attitudes and actions.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.580]   That's what counseling is about.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:03.540]   Now, I've done this before in the past.
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:08.980]   You can also tape your sessions and send them home as an assignment.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:18.660]   You can actually videotape it and the spouse's assignment is to go home and put the DVD in
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:21.560]   the player and watch it on the television.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.300]   And the other spouse that's usually moving through the house or gets curious and plops
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.680]   down the chair and they end up sitting down listening to the counseling session.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680]   Sometimes that's helpful.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:38.340]   There are certain ways that you can do this.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:43.580]   And there are other ways that you can secure also involvement of the person who won't come
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.340]   through personal contact.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:53.020]   Maybe you could ask them, give them an assignment and ask the spouse that is willing to come,
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:28:00.060]   "Will you take this to your husband or wife and will you ask them to fill out eight or
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:07.020]   ten areas that they think are the most important areas that need to be worked on in the marriage?"
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:13.460]   That'll give you a lot of data.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:19.620]   And prioritize those things.
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:26.420]   They don't want to go through the process of counseling, we can at least solicit their
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:35.520]   input sometimes indirectly in counseling.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.180]   Of course, when you do that, you don't want to make it too difficult or too hard because
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.420]   the spouse is unwilling to come to begin with.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:49.600]   They're not going to want to do a really difficult assignment.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.060]   But if it's an assignment explaining all the problems with the spouse that is willing to
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:59.440]   come, then they may be willing to fill out a lengthy sheet.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:04.740]   Let me tell you what's wrong with them.
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:04.780]   Counseling.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.280]   Counseling.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:15.280]   Counseling.
