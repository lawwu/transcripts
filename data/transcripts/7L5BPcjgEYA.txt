[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.380]   the Gospel according to Saint Mark, in the first chapter and in verses fourteen and fifteen.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.620]   Verses fourteen and fifteen, in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Mark.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:34.260]   Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.700]   of God and saying, "The time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.540]   Repent ye and believe the Gospel."
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.260]   Now this is a most momentous statement.
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.020]   After that John was put in prison, that is to say, John the Baptist, Jesus came into
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:11.080]   Galilee preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God and saying, "The time is fulfilled
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.540]   and the Kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.620]   Repent ye and believe the Gospel."
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.980]   Now in these words this particular Gospel writer, Mark, gives us at the very outset
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:39.020]   an epitome, a kind of summary of the whole message that he is going to unfold in his
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.020]   Gospel.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.540]   He has introduced it, he has given us very briefly, as is his characteristic as a writer,
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.060]   certain essential preliminaries.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.800]   But it is here he really comes to the thing that he wants to talk about.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.140]   In a sense, he announced it in the first verse by saying, "The beginning of the Gospel
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.240]   of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.300]   And then he went back and just gave us a little glimpse of the ministry of John the Baptist
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.780]   who was our Lord's forerunner or herald, the one who came preparing the way for him,
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.340]   calling people to be ready for him and his message, saying that he was nothing but a
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.500]   vice himself, that there was another mightier than he coming after him, the lechate of whose
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.300]   shoes he says, "I am not worthy to stoop down and then loose."
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   He says, "I am only preliminary, I am only preparatory.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.500]   He is about to come."
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.580]   Very well, here Mark tells us that John was cast into prison, he was thrown into prison,
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.820]   you remember, because of his faithful preaching to King Herod, his denunciation of his illicit
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.860]   and illegal marriage arrangements and life and so on, John was thrown into prison.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:10.980]   All right, after that, Jesus came into Galilee and he began, his ministry begins.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.460]   Now then, it is to this I want to call your attention this evening.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.300]   Because it is, as I say, such a perfect summary of what Christianity really is, what it stands
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.940]   for, what the message of the gospel really is.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.660]   And I am doing this, I think, I need scarcely say, because perhaps there is nothing that
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.380]   is so sadly needed in this modern world as just again a simple, direct, and varnished
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.660]   statement as to what the gospel is about.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.940]   Now, this is, as I am never tired of saying from this pulpit, to me the standing and almost
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.260]   perpetual problem.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.380]   How does it come to pass, with open Bibles before us, that men and women should not so
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.820]   much be wrong about certain details with respect to the gospel, but should be wrong about the
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.980]   whole thing, should be wrong about the very essence of the gospel?
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.220]   Now, I say that it is quite understandable that there should be certain points, certain
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.860]   aspects, certain facets of truth about which people are not clear, about which there may
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.220]   be division of opinion, that is all right, we can well understand that because this gospel
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.220]   is many-sided, has many aspects, many divisions of truth, that is not surprising.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.580]   But I do suggest that it is indeed a very surprising thing that in 1963 men and women
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.660]   should still be all wrong about what the gospel is, wrong about its foundation, wrong about
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:04.140]   its central message, wrong about its objective, wrong about the way in which one comes into
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.740]   relationship with it, and yet I suggest to you that that is the very position by which
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.660]   we are confronted at the present time.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.120]   Now, I am in a sense not blaming the modern men and women, those who are outside the Christian
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   church.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.100]   There is a sense in which I don't blame them for their bewilderment and for the fact
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.420]   that they are outside the church, because, alas, we are living in days and times when
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.820]   the church herself is mainly responsible for the confusion.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.020]   And that is why I say that there is nothing which is more urgently important than at any
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.300]   rate we should be clear about our approach to this gospel, because if our initial approach
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.700]   is wrong, everything must be wrong.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.000]   That's obvious, isn't it?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.220]   If you are setting out upon a journey, if you want to go to a given place, if you set
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.660]   out upon the wrong road, you will not arrive at your destination.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.180]   The time to be extremely careful is at the beginning, the first step.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.740]   Now, I am suggesting that the main trouble today, as I see it, with so many people who
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.340]   are quite honest and sincere and who tell us honestly and sincerely that they are not
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.620]   Christians, their main trouble, I want to suggest tonight, is that their whole notion
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.820]   of Christianity is wrong, and that therefore they must be wrong over all the details as
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.820]   they are.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:36.100]   Now, let me try to crystallize this by giving you a typical modern example or statement
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.540]   of this very thing to which I am referring.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:47.820]   A book has recently been published with the title Soundings, and it has been written by
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.660]   a number of scholars in Cambridge.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.260]   Now let me just read a few words to you out of a review on this book which bears the title
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.300]   of Soundings.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.700]   This is the reviewer writing.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:10.260]   First of all, he quotes a sentence from the book, "It is a time for making soundings,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.980]   not charts and maps."
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.460]   That's one of the writers, that's the editor of the book.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:23.900]   He says, "It isn't a time for making charts or maps, it's a time for taking soundings."
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.420]   And the reviewer goes on.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:33.420]   He says, "If this suggests that the authors are all at sea, fair enough.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.460]   So are we all, or should be."
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.580]   Don't quite know what he means there, but that's how he puts it.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.420]   He says, "Fair enough, so are we all, or should be."
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.620]   I think what he really means to be fair to him is that we all should be somewhere on
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.460]   this uncharted ocean.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.900]   That we shouldn't be on the shore, we should be on the sea.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.500]   I don't think he means us to take 'at sea' in the way that you've taken it and
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.980]   in the way that I myself first took it when I read the sentence.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.420]   All right.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:19.420]   But then he goes on, and this is what he says, "The Church has no earthly chance of survival
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:28.720]   in the nuclear age if it thinks that the depths of the knowledge of God's truth are all
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:37.100]   known and can be plumbed by anyone who sits at the end of the pier with a string of texts
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.660]   in his hand."
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.580]   Now that's the crucial statement.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:51.420]   The Church has no earthly chance of survival in this nuclear age if it thinks that the
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:59.980]   depths of the knowledge of God's truth are all known—known already—and can be plumbed
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.500]   by anyone who sits at the end of the pier with a string of texts in his hand.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.060]   Then he goes on, "It is to be hoped that many others will have the faith and courage
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:18.700]   to launch out into the deep with the authors of this book to pilot them."
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:25.500]   Now then, there I think is a very typical and representative statement of this modern
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   position.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   What's it mean?
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.780]   Well, let me put it in other language.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.820]   This is what he's saying.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:39.220]   Now he says we must start from this point, that you and I are living in the atomic age.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.860]   That's the basic thing.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:52.300]   We are living in 1963, not 1863, not 1763, not 1663, not AD 63.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.420]   We are living in the atomic age.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:01.620]   Very well, that's changed everything.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.220]   What may have been true in the past is no longer true.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:13.140]   And if the Church is to survive in this atomic age, then you've got to give up this notion
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.180]   that truth is already known, that all the depths are already familiar to men.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.420]   You've got to realize that you're out in the midst of an ocean.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.960]   You've got no map, you've got no chart, you don't know where you are.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.300]   The only thing you can do is to take soundings, get some notion of the depth beneath you,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   where you are.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.700]   Are you on clear land or are you not?
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700]   Take soundings.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.300]   No chart, no map, it's a time for taking soundings.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:50.780]   In other words, the whole position can be represented like this, that because of all
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:56.860]   the scientific discoveries and the advance of knowledge, particularly scientific, everything
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.340]   is once more in the melting pot.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:10.300]   And all we can do now is to experiment, take soundings, try to make discoveries, try, if
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.100]   possible, having made your soundings, to get some sort of a map or a chart.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.100]   But it's very difficult.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.740]   It's no time for that, we are told.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:24.180]   No, no, it's no time for making charts and maps, but merely for making soundings, taking
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.180]   these soundings.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.100]   So here we are.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.820]   What man can do, and the only thing he can do at this present time, in this atomic age,
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.860]   is, well, begin to think again, begin to study, begin to read these great philosophers and
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.620]   scientists and try and get some glimpse of truth at last and hold on to it as best you
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.620]   can.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.620]   That's the way.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.660]   And he says he hopes that many will have sufficient courage and faith to launch out into the deep.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.820]   I don't quite follow this, but listen, let me read it again to you.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.100]   It is to be hoped that many others will have the faith and courage to launch out into the
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.460]   deep with the authors of this book, to pilot them.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.140]   How you can pilot without a chart and a map, I don't know.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:09.520]   I should have thought that a pilot is a man who knows the place, who knows the channel.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.380]   I once lived in a town where there was a docks.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.380]   And I used to notice two lots of men, indoor pilots, outdoor pilots.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:24.020]   And when the ship had passed through this lock gates, the outdoor pilot came along.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.860]   There was a bit of a river to go down before you came to the sea.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.340]   Why did they need this outdoor pilot?
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.940]   Oh, there was only one answer.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.940]   He knew the channel.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.420]   He'd got it in his mind.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.420]   He knew the map.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   He'd got a chart.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.860]   He knew what to avoid.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.140]   He knew when to keep near to this side, when to keep near to that side.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.300]   And so with others as they go out to sea, if there are hidden sandbanks and so on.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.500]   The value of the pilot is that he knows the channel.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   He's got a map.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   He's got a chart.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.980]   And he's an expert in it.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.140]   But here we are asked to venture out to sea, to be piloted by men who tell us themselves
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:06.500]   that they haven't got a chart nor a map, but that they are proposing to take some soundings.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:15.820]   Now my friends, that's the position in which so many find themselves this evening.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.700]   And it is because these words that I've taken as my text tonight seem to me to deal with
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.180]   this position and to answer it, that I'm calling your attention to it.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:35.860]   We are living certainly in a time of crisis, in a time of confusion.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:43.400]   We are living in a world in which the kind of thing I've just been announcing as having
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.500]   happened last Friday night can happen to any one of us at any moment.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.580]   You see, if we could be sure and certain that we've got 50 years to live, well, then you
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.780]   might say, "Well, there's no need to be in a hurry about this.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.360]   It's very exciting, very thrilling.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.380]   Let's follow the investigations.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.600]   Let's take the soundings."
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.040]   But my dear friend, you and I may come to the end of the journey at any moment.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.760]   Is there nothing that can be given us?
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.260]   Is there no chart and compass?
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.300]   Is there no knowledge?
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.780]   Is there no pilot who can step on board and give me an assurance that I'm going to arrive
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.340]   in the everlasting haven of God?
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.340]   That's what I want.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.660]   Isn't that what you want?
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.180]   I take it you're here because you want that.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.220]   Thank God there is a positive answer.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:40.660]   I'm here and I'm standing in this pulpit because I'm not making soundings.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.900]   I've got a chart.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.200]   I've got a map.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.380]   And I want to tell you something about it, as simply and as plainly as I can.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:53.260]   "Now then, look how all this is dealt with here," I say, "so plainly and so clearly."
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.980]   No, I'm simply going to pick out the words that are in the text.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.860]   After that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching, preaching.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.860]   Now, there is the key at once.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.860]   What does it mean?
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:14.220]   Well, the word that is translated "preaching" here is a very interesting word.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.000]   It is a word that is not confined to Christianity or to the Christian church at all.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.300]   It was a word that was very common in the Roman Empire at the time when these things
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.280]   were first written and when they first happened.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:34.820]   It was a word that was used in particular in connection with the cult that had arisen
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.960]   of the emperor worship.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.240]   You realize that they used to worship those Roman emperors.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   They didn't always do that, but they reached a point when they began to worship.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.080]   Don't laugh at them, because we've seen something very similar in this century.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.700]   That was what happened with Hitler in Germany, and it's happened in other ways in other
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   countries.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.820]   Men's always ready to worship men.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.240]   Let's be careful.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.760]   Let's be careful in our judgments.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Emperor worship.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   Now, then, the word "preaching" came in in this way.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:16.120]   When a son and heir was born to the emperor, a proclamation was made, a great announcement
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.440]   was made, and the word that was used for that very process was the word translated "preaching."
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.580]   It's an announcement, a proclamation.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.680]   It happened when the heir was born, it happened when he came of age, it happened at his accession
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   to the throne or to the imperial power.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.560]   So what we are told is this, that when John was put into prison, Jesus came into Galilee
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.040]   announcing, proclaiming, heralding.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.400]   It was the peculiar work of the herald to do this very thing.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:58.960]   Now, the word is interesting, therefore, because it conveys this notion and idea at once, doesn't
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   it?
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:10.240]   A herald doesn't make an uncertain announcement, a herald doesn't get up and blow his trumpet
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.200]   and say, "Listen, we don't quite know what's happening or what might happen or what's going
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.720]   to take place, but, well, we only hope that something is going to happen."
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   That's not heralding.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.140]   No, no, the herald had a definite, specific message.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.180]   That's why he gets up and blows his trumpet, "Listen," he says, "I've got something to
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.180]   tell you.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.080]   I've got an announcement to make."
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.280]   That's the term that is used here about what our Lord did.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.160]   It's the term that's used about what the apostles did afterwards.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.400]   It is the word that has been used about preaching in the Christian church ever since.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:51.840]   So you see, we start with a note of certainty, authority, issued from the imperial palace.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.720]   That was the first word uttered.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.560]   Not a man getting up and saying, "Well, my opinion is, you know, that before long there
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   will be an announcement."
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.560]   No, no.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.040]   He stood up and had a bit of paper in his hand and he said, "Issued by the imperial
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.720]   palace at such and such a time, we have the honour to inform you."
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.000]   That's it.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.480]   Preaching.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.880]   It carries, the very word carries within it the whole notion of authority, of certainty,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.680]   an absolute, unequivocal statement.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.800]   You see, this is the very opposite, isn't it, of inviting people to a quest or to a
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.520]   search.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.500]   This has always been popular, this notion that a Christian is a man who is seeking and
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:44.000]   searching after truth, that he's a man who sets out in a journey this vast and explored
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.440]   expanse of truth.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.680]   A Christian, what is he?
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.160]   Well, he's a man who doesn't just spend his time eating and drinking and indulging
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   his passions.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.360]   He's an intellectual man and he sets out in the quest, the search for truth.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.460]   Oh, and it's thrilling, it's wonderful.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.800]   The uncharted oceans, the promised land, the unknown, and off you set with this thrill
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.000]   and excitement of the quest for truth.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.080]   It's been very popular always.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.480]   Man likes that kind of thing.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.760]   It appeals to his spirit of adventure.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.280]   And there have been men who haven't hesitated to say this.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.460]   Their criticism of our evangelical gospel has always been that it's too certain and
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.400]   too dogmatic.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.560]   You see, the poets like saying this sort of thing, don't they?
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.440]   The poets of all men have generally fooled themselves more than others.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.080]   It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.280]   Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.200]   Better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.040]   In other words, you people in this chapel are to be pitied.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.320]   You set out to come to Westminster Chapel and you've arrived.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.520]   The pity is that you're not going round and round on the inner circle.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.440]   Better to travel hopefully than to arrive.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:14.960]   That's it, you see, the quest for truth, the excitement of the chase, the thrill of
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   the investigation, how boring when you arrive, how disappointing when you rarely discover.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.880]   You see, they're not interested in truth at all.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.000]   They're interested in themselves as seekers and searchers after the truth.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.080]   Thus they fool themselves.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.560]   But life isn't a game.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.280]   Life isn't a play.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   Life isn't play-acting.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.880]   Oh, life is serious and solemn.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.360]   Life is real.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   Life is earnest.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.120]   And that's the sort of life and world that we find ourselves in tonight.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.160]   So I say at the beginning, thank God that as I look at this I'm not invited to some
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   great experiment or to some great search or quest or journey of exploration.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.720]   In the midst of my failure in life and my many failures, with my heart breaking and
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:19.040]   my soul bleeding, and as I'm almost giving up in despair, I suddenly hear a bugle call
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.440]   or a trumpet sounding and I say, "What's this?"
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.240]   Thank God I hear an authoritative proclamation.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.680]   I hear a man saying, "Listen, I'm a herald.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.960]   I've got a message from the Imperial Palace.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:36.040]   I announce to you, preaching."
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.240]   I say, "Well, that's the beginning of the Gospel, you see."
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:47.000]   Now let me translate that into simpler, more ordinary language.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.320]   I'm here to tell you, my friends, that the answer to all your questions is in this one
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.600]   book, the Bible.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:02.000]   If I'm a herald and I am, thank God, unworthy though I am, I'm a herald.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.320]   I'm not here to tell you my theories and my ideas about life tonight; they're no better
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.760]   than yours.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:17.280]   I'm here because I've been given a message from the Imperial Palace, and here it is.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:25.080]   And I'm here to tell you with authority, with the authority of God, that all your questions
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.320]   have already been answered and all your problems have already been solved.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:38.640]   You have but to listen to this preaching, this proclamation, and you'll find peace
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.520]   and rest for your souls.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   And if you should be asked to pass from time to eternity tonight, you'll know where you're
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   going.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.640]   You'll not be alone.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.600]   You'll be able to say with the Apostle Paul, "I know him whom I have believed, and I am
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.760]   persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him until that day."
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.680]   Thank God we've got preaching, proclamation, authoritative pronouncement.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   Very well, there's our first word; let's go on to the second thing which we notice.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.360]   The second thing I notice about this gospel, about this Christian preaching, is this, that
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.880]   it announces a plan and a purpose.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.920]   Where do you find that, says someone, well, let me tell you.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:35.440]   Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and saying, "The time
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   is fulfilled."
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.320]   What's he mean by that?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.960]   Well, what he means, you see, is this.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.400]   The time that has been spoken of has come to pass.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   It's fulfilled.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.520]   But what's this about time?
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.800]   Well, here is the great message of the Bible, if you like, from beginning to end.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:05.140]   The message of the Bible is simply this, that God has got a plan and a purpose for this
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.560]   world of sin and of shame.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:15.240]   That is really the one big message of the Bible.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.840]   Here we are, I say, in our failure, in our unhappiness, in our utter confusion.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.960]   We've tried, we've stridden, we've done our best, but it comes to nothing.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.720]   The world gets worse and worse, and we get worse and worse.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   And we get more and more hopeless and more filled with despair.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.600]   We are baffled by the immensity of the problems, and all this scientific discovery makes it
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   worse rather than better.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.680]   And here we are, in utter hopelessness.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.000]   We've tried to read the philosophers, but they don't know any more than we do.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   They can speculate, they can make their dogmatic assertions, but we find they're disproved,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.880]   they're always being changed.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   What do we do?
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.920]   Where can we go?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   Is there any hope of deliverance?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.800]   Is there any possible way out?
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.200]   Here comes the message.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.240]   There is!
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:11.000]   God has got a plan and a purpose for this world.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.480]   And it is a plan to deliver men and women such as ourselves out of the morass into which
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:26.380]   we've fallen, to give us, if you like, in the midst of this uncharted ocean, a map,
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:33.560]   a chart, a compass, a direction, a pilot, everything we need.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.360]   God himself has planned it.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:44.640]   Now, if all that is implicit in this phrase, the time is fulfilled, the time of God's
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.280]   plan, coming, as it were, into operation, has actually arrived.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.720]   That's the meaning of the word, "The time is fulfilled."
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:26:03.560]   Now, the Bible, you see, puts it like this, that God had made this plan even before the
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.740]   foundation of the world itself.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.680]   You remember how the Apostle Paul puts that in preaching to the people at Corinth when
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.520]   he first went amongst them.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.720]   He puts it like this in 1 Corinthians 2, 7.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   He says, "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.560]   ordained before the world unto our glory."
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.600]   There it is.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.720]   Now, this is the essence of this proclamation that is being made.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.560]   This is the essence of Christian preaching.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.460]   He doesn't say to us, "Well, now, there is truth, that uncharted ocean.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.680]   Get out onto it.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   Take your soundings.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.920]   Try and get your bearings.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   Try and find out.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   Put it down if you can.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   Yes, you've discovered a little bit.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.560]   You may go for weeks and find nothing.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   Months, years pass.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.160]   Then, just another little glimmer at long, "Oh, no, it won't happen in your time.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.600]   It'll happen, perhaps, well, your grandchildren, oh, perhaps even longer.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   But go on.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   It's marvellous.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   Keep on.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   Keep on searching.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.040]   You'll find you've been wrong as your forefathers were.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   But go on searching.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   See."
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   No, no.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.980]   It is the exact opposite of that.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.540]   The message of this book is not to urge us to try and find truth.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:25.740]   It is to ask us to listen to the truth, to God's truth, for its whole point is to say
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:34.260]   that God, knowing himself, knowing man, knowing everything, has devised and schemed a plan
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:40.980]   whereby man can be delivered out of his failure and sin and can be made a citizen and a worthy
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.600]   citizen of God's kingdom, God's plan.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.460]   It not only tells us that God has a plan and that he planned it before the foundation of
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:57.180]   the world, it tells us that God has made this plan now.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.180]   He's made it now.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:05.660]   "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past, and to the fathers by
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:11.060]   the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his son."
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.060]   That's it.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.060]   Same thing.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:20.200]   You see, your Old Testament is nothing but God revealing his plan and his purpose.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.140]   He did it in that extraordinary way.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.500]   He took a man called Abram and turned him into a nation, and then he spoke to that nation.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.620]   He gave them his word, which they collected.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.620]   They called them the oracles of God.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.540]   We call them the Old Testament now.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.780]   He took a man called Moses and he gave him a revelation of how he'd created the world
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.920]   and men, how sin had come in and what had happened, and how then he had this great plan
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.780]   and purpose which he worked out.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:50.180]   God has revealed it all.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:56.220]   And the message of the Bible is just to tell us about this plan and purpose of God which
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.860]   he has revealed in that way through the instrumentality of men, in order that we may know what we've
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.340]   got to do and find salvation through doing it.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:13.580]   Well then, the next thing that follows, you see, is this, that this is something that
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.220]   God has already done.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:26.480]   And because God has already done it, I needn't waste a second in trying to discover truth.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.820]   All I need do is to pay attention to the truth that God has already revealed through the
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.580]   prophets, through the teachers of the Old Testament, through his Son, through the apostles
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   of the New Testament.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.820]   It's all here.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.660]   I don't need anything fresh or new.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.620]   All I need has already been given.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.700]   And of course that is why preaching is possible.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.180]   If it were anything tonight, it wouldn't be preaching.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:04.020]   It would be a sort of philosophical society, or a semi-political ethical society, and I'd
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.100]   be here saying, "Well, now we see the mess we're in, what can we do?"
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:12.460]   And I'd put theories and ideas before you, I'd say, "Go home and consider that.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.780]   What do you think about it?
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.780]   Shall we try it?
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.340]   Shall we see how we get on with it?
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340]   That's all right."
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.180]   But you see, it's got nothing to do with this.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:26.660]   Here is a proclamation which comes and says, "Thus saith the Lord, this is my way, this
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.660]   is my plan, you believe this and you'll find it's true."
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:40.820]   That's the message, God's plan, nothing matters but this.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.580]   And you see, of course, in the light of that, that all this talk about the atomic age is
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.100]   just stuff and nonsense.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.600]   Atomic age, got nothing to do with it.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   Why?
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.720]   Well, because God is still what he was two thousand years ago.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.980]   God doesn't change.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.340]   The splitting of the atom doesn't make the slightest difference to God.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.900]   God's character is what he's always revealed it to be.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.620]   He revealed it back through Moses and the Ten Commandments.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.100]   He is a holy God, he is a hater of sin, he's one who's going to punish them.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.860]   God hasn't changed, not at all.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.060]   He never will change.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.540]   He is the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.860]   Oh, I'll go further, God cannot change, it's impossible.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.740]   He is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:47.180]   He is the eternal, absolute God, the all and in all, I am everlastingly, I am what I am.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:53.340]   But at the same time, it is equally true to say that man doesn't change.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.900]   The Church has no hope in this atomic age.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   Why not?
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.380]   Well, they say, because man is no different.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.420]   Man knows things that he didn't know a hundred years ago.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.420]   Does he?
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420]   All right, of course.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.660]   He knows that he can split the atom.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.020]   Even I, when I did some science, was taught that there was nothing smaller than the atom,
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.380]   that the atom is indivisible.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.500]   That's wrong, of course, now.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.940]   We were told it then with great dogmatism.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.180]   But by now, that's wrong.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.140]   And probably what they're saying now will be wrong in a hundred years or so.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.140]   I don't know.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.140]   It doesn't matter.
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:35.860]   All I have to say is this, what has all that got to do with me?
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:41.180]   Is man as men any different?
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.340]   Is man different morally?
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:48.220]   Has man given up drinking because he split the atom?
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:54.900]   Has man given up immorality because he can send a man up into outer space?
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:00.100]   Has man ceased to have lusts and passions and evil desires within him because of all
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   these tremendous advances?
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   And you know the answer.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:12.820]   They don't make the slightest difference, they're complete irrelevances.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.900]   The problem of men tonight is what the problem of men has always been.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.780]   Men's problem has been this from the beginning.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.540]   There were two brothers, one called Cain, one called Abel.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.220]   And Cain was jealous of Abel and murdered him.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.900]   Men still like that.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.260]   Read your Old Testament and about the characters in the Old Testament.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.260]   You'll find them.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:43.140]   There they are, drunkards, adulterers, thieves, robbers, jealousy, envy, malice, spite, greed,
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.140]   avarice.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.660]   It's all still with us.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.540]   These are the problems of life.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.380]   The atom's got nothing to do with it.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   It's man.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.380]   Man is a moral being, man is a spiritual being, and all these things don't touch it.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.940]   There's our problem.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.580]   And so, you see, we must get rid of this notion that because we are in the atomic age, we
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.860]   need something new.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.260]   We don't.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.580]   You notice how this man puts it.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.260]   He says, "You get rid of this notion that you can sit at the end of the pier with a
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.860]   string of texts in your hands.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.100]   Don't you believe," he says, "that ultimate truth is already known?"
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.740]   He says, "This is the thing that is monstrous."
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:28.260]   The Church has no earthly chance of survival in the nuclear age if it thinks that the depths
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.760]   of the knowledge of God's truth are all known.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.940]   And I'm here tonight to tell you that they are all known.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.340]   They've all been revealed by God himself.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.920]   If the knowledge of God were dependent upon men and men seeking and searching, obviously,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.460]   one generation would have an advantage over the previous one.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.060]   But as we happen to be in this position, in which men by searching cannot find God at
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.380]   any age or at any time, we are entirely dependent upon the revelation of God.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.460]   And as God has already given his revelation, the people to whom it first came know as much
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.300]   as you and I know, and nobody will ever know more than them.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.100]   Now this is, to me, absolutely crucial and basic.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:18.940]   You see, according to that other argument, you and I, because we are living in the twentieth
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.460]   century, should know more about God than the apostle Paul did.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.620]   We should know more about the Lord Jesus Christ than the apostles did.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   Why?
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.660]   Well, because we are in the twentieth century, in the atomic age, and look at the great aggregate
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.740]   of knowledge that we have obtained since.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:41.020]   But you see, according to this, it makes not the slightest difference, none at all.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:46.420]   The Christian church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.420]   Why?
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.020]   Oh, I can tell you why.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.980]   God chose these men, these apostles and prophets, to give them the revelation, to give them
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.820]   the knowledge that man needs.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.320]   They were special people.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.220]   In the old dispensation, he had these men whom he called prophets.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.580]   He picked them, he chose them, and when he had taken the men, he gave them the message,
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.620]   and then he guided him and inspired him by the Spirit in the careful, accurate writing
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   and recording of it.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.540]   God did it all, and the men—he wasn't a passive amanuensis, no, no, his personality
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.700]   comes in—but the message and the truth of it is entirely from God, not the men.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.820]   The same with the apostles and prophets.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:38.660]   And if the world lasts another billion years, man will never know more about God or about
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:44.620]   Christ or about heaven and about hell and about salvation than he can know now if he
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.060]   reads this book with spiritual eyes.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:53.740]   We are in no more advantageous position than the people of the first century.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.900]   Who would like to say that any modern man knows Christ as well as Paul knew him?
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.620]   What arrogance it is, what nonsense it is.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.840]   This is not a matter of knowledge aggregating and adding to itself.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:13.180]   This is receiving the revelation that God gives, and he has given it once and forever.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180]   Very well.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180]   What is it?
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.180]   Let me hurry on.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.500]   The thing that we are told next, therefore, is this, that this plan of God is carried
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.420]   out by God acting in history.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.880]   This is again a vital point.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.020]   Christianity is not primarily a teaching; it is a recorded history.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.100]   Christianity is not urging men to think and to try to delve into the mystery and discover
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.100]   truth about God.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.860]   It says, "Listen, this is what God has done."
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.420]   Isn't that what happened on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem in Peter's first sermon?
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.500]   Isn't that what the people said about the apostles when they began to speak with tongues?
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.820]   What is this, they said?
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.780]   We do hear all these people speaking in our own tongues.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   What?
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.120]   The wonderful works of God.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.260]   Not the thoughts of God, but the works of God, the things that God has done.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.900]   And you see, that is the message of Christianity.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.420]   Do you know what it is?
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.420]   Listen.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.420]   Here it is.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.900]   Now, after that John the Baptist was put into prison, that's a fact of history.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.340]   That's an event in history, in time.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.340]   As Julius Caesar conquered this country in 55 or 54 B.C., whichever it was, so at a given
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.900]   point in time John the Baptist was thrown into prison.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:35.340]   And at that moment Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:44.880]   and saying, "The time is fulfilled."
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:52.060]   Listen to me," he said, "it's happened, it's come, it's arrived."
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.140]   Now what does this mean?
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:39:00.180]   It means this, that your salvation and mine, my dear friend, depends not upon our thoughts,
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:07.420]   not upon our understanding, not upon our discovery of truth, it depends entirely and utterly
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:16.960]   upon something that has literally happened in this world 1963 years ago.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.520]   So we preach to this atomic age, and this is what we say, "Don't come and, not come
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.680]   and join us in the uncharted ocean and help us to take soundings in order that we may
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.680]   arrive ultimately."
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:33.000]   It says, "Look back, look back, go back to 2000 years, first century."
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.280]   Listen, when John was thrown into prison, Jesus came and said, "It's happened, it's
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.920]   arrived, the time is fulfilled, that's it."
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:51.380]   In other words, let me put it in this form, your salvation and mine depends not upon our
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:58.920]   understanding but upon what God has done in Christ.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.360]   Thank God for this.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.720]   You and I are not all of us philosophers, and we haven't got great brains and understandings,
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.440]   but when I'm told a fact I can believe it.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   There's a man standing and saying, "I've come from the imperial palace, a son and heir
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.920]   has been born to the emperor."
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.880]   I'm no philosopher, but I can understand that.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   "Good," I say, "wonderful, I'd like to see that child."
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.480]   Very well, here comes a proclamation and says, "When the fullness of the times was come,
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.200]   God sent forth his son made of a woman," and it means your salvation if you accept it and
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.720]   give yourself to it.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.280]   It's a unique event.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.920]   There is a further reason for you never to talk again about this atomic age.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.600]   The atomic age makes no difference.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.040]   No age makes any difference at all.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.280]   The turning point of history was two thousand years ago.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.480]   There is the end of an age, the beginning of a new age.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:57.120]   Here is the turning point of all time, the crucial event, the unique event, God's event,
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   God acting.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:06.840]   Here it is, "When John, Jesus, came," history.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:13.640]   Very well, I say, let's get rid of this talk about atomic age.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:24.720]   The only age that matters is that point, the new age, the new dispensation, God's time.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:30.600]   Very well, my dear friend, the preaching of the gospel comes to you tonight and it doesn't
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:36.200]   invite you to a quest or to a search or to an endeavor or to some wonderful thrill of
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.680]   hoping to find.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.440]   It says, "Just as you are, look back."
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:51.960]   God has already done all that is necessary for your every need and your salvation.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   What is it?
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.120]   Well, let me just give it to you in a few words.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.840]   It's called here a gospel.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:09.480]   He came preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and saying, "The time is fulfilled
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.000]   and the kingdom of God is at hand."
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.520]   Now that's not a good translation there, I'll give you a better one.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:23.960]   "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near."
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.280]   He doesn't mean it's about to come, he says it has come.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.920]   It has drawn near or it has come near, not at hand.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920]   It's come near.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.560]   Indeed, it's arrived amongst you.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   What does he mean?
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.480]   Well, what our Lord was saying was this.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:46.600]   God, he says you know, has been promising throughout the centuries that he was going
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.080]   to do something crucial.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.720]   "Read your Old Testament," he says, "in effect.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.280]   Remember what God said a way back in the Garden of Eden?
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.520]   He said, 'It's all right, you've sinned and you're going to be punished, but the seed
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.720]   of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.'
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   That's it.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   It's going to come.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:08.440]   And on through your Old Testament this promise is repeated, it's increased, it's coming
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.360]   and they were all looking forward.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:16.320]   And the prophets, look at Isaiah 40 that I read to you, "Comfort ye my people, saith
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   your God."
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.800]   He said it eight centuries before Christ was born.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.920]   But what he was saying was this, "All flesh shall see the salvation of God."
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.560]   You don't see it now, he said, "Comfort, prepare, every valley shall be exalted and
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.000]   every hill shall be brought low, remove the stones, prepare a highway, be ready."
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.640]   He's coming, this Messiah, this Deliverer, he's coming.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   And all the prophets said the same, and the people were waiting and longing, and Messiah,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.400]   a Deliverer, is going to come.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:56.280]   And our Lord suddenly appeared and began to preach and he said, "The time is fulfilled,
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.560]   and the Kingdom of God has come, what God has promised throughout the centuries he has
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.920]   now fulfilled."
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.600]   He says, "This is good news, this is gospel."
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   Why?
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.680]   "Because it is an announcement of the coming of the Kingdom of God."
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.280]   He preached the Kingdom of God.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.680]   What does that mean?
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:21.960]   Well, you see, the Kingdom of God means the reign of God.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:28.120]   The world is as it is because it's rebelled against God.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.120]   And man is in his present trouble and distress because he's a rebel.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.560]   And because he's reaping the fruits of his own evil deeds and God is pouring his punishment
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   down upon him.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.880]   "Take it from me, my friend, the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.280]   There is no peace, saith my God to the wicked.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.880]   And your clever modern man in the atomic age is in trouble.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.280]   And as long as he turns his back upon God, his trouble will increase.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.480]   Let him be as clever as he likes, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:02.520]   The way of the transgressor is hard."
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.080]   But the Kingdom of God is the very antithesis of that.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.880]   It's the rule of God, it's the reign of God.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.480]   It means the coming of righteousness, it means the coming of peace.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   It means that evil is controlled and defeated.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.740]   It means that God's blessings are showered upon us.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.320]   It means that we bask in the sunshine of God's favour.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.960]   It means that we become heirs of God and with a hope of everlasting bliss.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   That's what it is.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.320]   Did you notice that last hymn we sang, it put it very well?
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:40.160]   "The race, hark the glad sound, the Saviour comes, the Saviour promised long."
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.160]   This is preaching.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.360]   "Let every heart prepare a throne and every voice a song."
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   Why?
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.840]   "Well, he comes, the prisoners to release in Satan's bondage held.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.120]   The gates of brass before him burst, the iron fetters yield.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.240]   Men's a slave of sin, he's in misery and bondage and unhappiness and he can't break free.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.800]   Here comes one who can break the bars of iron and the gates of brass in sunder.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.760]   He can set the prisoner free.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:14.280]   He comes from thickest films of vice to clear the mental ray and on the eyeballs of the
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.480]   blind to pause celestial day.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.620]   He comes, the broken heart to bind, the bleeding soul to cure and with the treasures of his
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.760]   grace to enrich the humble poor."
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.160]   That's what's meant by the kingdom of God.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.040]   You remember our Lord back in his hometown of Nazareth?
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.520]   He went as was his custom on the Sabbath into the synagogue and they handed the book unto
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.600]   him and he began to read and this is what he read.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:57.920]   He read from the book of the prophet Esaias, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:04.040]   he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, not the philosophers, not the great
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.700]   men of the atomic age, the poor of all ages.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:14.000]   He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.880]   of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.240]   year of the Lord."
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:26.080]   And he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.160]   of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened upon him and he began to say unto
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:43.180]   them, "Listen, this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.140]   He says, "The kingdom of God has arrived.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.580]   God's favor has come.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.460]   The day of release, the day of pardon, the day of renewal, the day of new life, the day
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.220]   of rejoicing in God and his government instead of rebelling against him.
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.220]   It's come.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.100]   The day of the favor of the Almighty, the day of the grace of God.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   It's come.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.100]   It's drawn near.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100]   It's arrived.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.100]   Good news."
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:16.540]   Oh, yes, and especially when you consider how it's arrived.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:22.340]   And it's arrived, you see, in this person, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:30.140]   Now, after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.260]   of God.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:35.460]   So the gospel of Jesus Christ is the same as the gospel of the kingdom of God.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.900]   Yes, it is in the coming of this person that the kingdom of God has come.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   God has been saying throughout the centuries, "I'm going to send a deliverer.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:43.900]   He's arrived."
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.540]   Where has he arrived?
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.780]   In the stable in Bethlehem.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.020]   There he is, the little babe in the manger.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.260]   He is the one who is the king.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.100]   The kingdom comes with the king.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.700]   He's arrived, and here he is preaching.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.700]   Who is he?
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.940]   Son of God, the beginning of the gospel of Christ, the Son of God.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:08.460]   Oh, my dear friend, this is the gospel.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.260]   You and I are not left, you see, to try and to delve into the mystery of the being and
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.660]   the person of God, and to try to discover a way out of our predicament.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.540]   No, no, the message is this.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:26.860]   "God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:35.660]   God hath sent forth his own Son, made of a woman made under the law, to redeem them that
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.460]   are under the law.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:45.860]   God so loved the world, this world, this damned, foolish, evil, foul world that you and I live
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:54.340]   in, and of which we are all a part by nature, God so loved it that he gave his only begotten
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:50:02.180]   Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.700]   My dear friend, forget about the atomic age.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.700]   Look back.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.700]   Look at the babe in the manger.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.580]   There he is, God in the flesh, God's deliverer.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.540]   God comes down to deliver you, to rescue you.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.740]   He does so in his person, he does so in his teaching, he does so in his work.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.500]   Mark goes on to tell us all about it in his Gospel.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:26.340]   And he does it supremely by dying upon a cross on a hill called Calvary.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.380]   That's the crucial act.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.340]   Because you and I, as we are, cannot enter the kingdom of God.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.100]   We are rebels, we are sinful, we are guilty, we are vile.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.780]   You can't live in God's kingdom unless you're a worthy citizen.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.100]   How can I enter?
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.100]   Here's the answer.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:53.780]   This is the good news, that he bore my sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.060]   dead to sin, should live unto righteousness.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.060]   Here's the message.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:04.460]   "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.460]   unto them.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.620]   He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:16.060]   of God in him; and thereby, dying on the cross, he has opened the gateway into the kingdom.
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:23.500]   And he says, 'Today is the day of salvation; enter in, come unto me, all ye that are weary
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:28.940]   and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:36.020]   The time is fulfilled, the time promised so long has arrived.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.100]   The kingdom of God is drawn nearer, come nearer.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:46.020]   He says, 'I am it, I am the king, come unto me.'
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:52.220]   Just as you are, thank God, you don't have to put yourself right first, you don't have
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:57.060]   to understand the profundities first, you don't have to set out in some great quest.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:02.660]   You may have to die before midnight tonight, and your question is, 'How can I stand before
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.660]   God?
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.340]   How can I know that I'm going to heaven and eternal bliss?'
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   And this is the answer.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.540]   The time is fulfilled, the kingdom has come.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:22.460]   The king is the Lord Jesus Christ, and he loved you so much that he died for you and
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.900]   your sins.
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:29.220]   And all he says to you is, 'Repent, think again, believe my message, repent and believe
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:35.260]   the gospel, acknowledge your folly, acknowledge your sin, acknowledge your shame, acknowledge
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:40.860]   your helplessness, stop making inquiries, stop setting out with your great intellect
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:50.500]   to understand, say, 'I cannot, I failed, God is God, and I'm man, finite, sinful, I cannot!'
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:58.540]   I believe that thou art the Son of God and the Saviour of my soul, that's all.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:08.940]   Simply believe, only believe, and thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to thee.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.860]   My dear friend, don't be a fool.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:17.660]   You don't understand life, you don't understand death, you don't understand yourself, you
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.700]   know nothing about tomorrow, how can you understand God?
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:26.620]   Give up, give in.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:34.500]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:39.980]   As the Philippian jailer was saved by believing it, as men have been saved by believing it
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:48.180]   throughout the centuries ever since, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ tonight.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:54.020]   Believe that this is God's plan, that he sends his only begotten Son into the world to redeem
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:58.340]   us because he alone could do it, because he alone was big enough and strong enough and
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.860]   mighty enough to take our sins and bear the punishment, nevertheless come out the other
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:08.020]   side and arise and take his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:17.180]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.920]   Is that good news to you?
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.700]   That's the test, you see.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.340]   Is this good news to you?
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.380]   Are you thrilled by it?
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.220]   Do you really want to sing about it?
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.900]   Do you want to crown him with many crowns, the Lamb upon his throne, hark how then the
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:38.460]   anthem drowns all music but its own, awake my soul and sing of him who died for thee
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.140]   and hail him as thy matchless king throughout eternity.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:47.540]   Do you want to do that?
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:57.540]   If you don't, it means that you are so blinded by sin and by sin, that you don't know that
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:05.140]   you are a lost soul, that you don't know that if you die like that you go to hell, to everlasting
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:08.380]   misery.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:13.780]   But if you have ever seen your need and failure, if you are afraid to die and to face God as
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:21.020]   any man in his senses must be, well then you say this is the most wonderful news I have
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:32.660]   ever heard, that God sent his own Son to reconcile me unto himself and in my utter helplessness
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:40.580]   and hopelessness all I do is to cast my sins on him, cast myself on him, cling to him just
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.300]   as I am.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.120]   There's nothing like it in heaven or in earth.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:56.580]   It's the most glorious good news that has ever come, that and that alone is the message
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.820]   of the Christian gospel.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:07.780]   Repent if you've never done before and believe the gospel and be safe, you will be safe,
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:12.620]   whether you die tonight or not will be in irrelevance, nothing matters, you'll be right,
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:23.300]   out of God, with your eternal future, absolutely safe, amen.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.220]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
