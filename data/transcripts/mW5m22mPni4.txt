[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   Alright, so the thing I'd like you to do now, if you haven't joined our Discord server yet,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.520]   is to go and click the link wanderbee.me/discord and accept the invitation to our Discord community server.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.040]   When you join in, in our Discord, you can explore the different channels,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.080]   you can check out the announcements from Weights & Biases, you can look at the news and the tips,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.760]   you can chat with the community on different topics, you can ask any questions about this
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.440]   or other courses that we do in the courses channel, and last but not least,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:56.800]   you can also chat with our LLM-powered application, which is called WandBot.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.920]   Let's try to ask a question to our WandBot. How about sharing reports with teammates?
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.800]   How do I do that? Let's say I have that question. I'm gonna ping WandBot and ask.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.200]   Let's check out the answer. This may take a while. WandBot is using a GPT-4 in the background,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.920]   which may take a couple of seconds to generate the response.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.880]   And we've got the response. So the WandBot responded that in order to share a report
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.280]   with team members, we need to save it. We need to click the share button in the upper right-hand
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.480]   corner of the report, and you can also provide an email address to invite team members, copy the
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   magic link, or share it with them. I think this information was pretty helpful, so I'm gonna give
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   it a thumbs up. And I encourage you to go into the Discord and ask questions of WandBot, and check
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.960]   out where it works well, where it may still struggle. And I invite you to also listen to
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.600]   the following videos, where we will describe the process of building a similar application
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.520]   to WandBot. By the way, WandBot is open-sourced, so if you want to check out in detail how it is
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.840]   currently built, then you can also click on the link to the repo that we provide below this video.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:41.440]   See you in the next video!
