[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Joe writes in to ask, "Pastor John, what is legalism?"
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The thing that makes this tricky is that there is no Hebrew word in the Old Testament,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   no Greek word in the New Testament for legalism.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   So whenever anyone uses the word, you have to do two things.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   You have to find out what they mean by it,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and then you have to find out if their meaning corresponds to something in the Bible,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   or are they making use of the Bible in a way that's inappropriate.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And that makes it a little trickier.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   When the Bible uses a word like "love," say you can go to a given text and say,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   "What does love mean there?"
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But the Bible doesn't have any word for legalism,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   so we can't go to any particular place and say, "There it is, right there."
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So I'll tell you what I would mean by using it,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and what in the Bible I think would warrant that kind of use,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   and then you can decide whether you think it should be used that way or not.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But mainly, check out the way people use it,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and measure it by things in the Bible to see if this is so.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Legalism is the conviction that law-keeping is now, after the fall,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   the ground of our acceptance with God.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'll say that again.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Legalism is the conviction that law-keeping is the ground of our acceptance with God,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   the ground of God being for us and not against us.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So if you ask, "How can I get God to be for me and not against me?"
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The legalist answer is, "Keep the law. Perform the law."
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Now, that's wrong, and the reason we call that legalism is because it's renounced.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's denounced in the New Testament.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Romans 3:20, "By works of the law, no human being will be justified in his sight,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   because through the law comes the knowledge of sin."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Or Romans 3:28, "For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Or Galatians 2:16, "We know that a person is not justified by works of the law."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So we call it legalism if one says, "We are justified by works of the law."
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We do get God to be for us.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   God becomes our friend when we measure up by keeping the law.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And the biblical gospel is the good news.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's impossible. God knows it's impossible, and he has provided another way,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   namely the way of faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   who himself bore our punishment for not keeping the law,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and himself fulfilled our requirement that we do keep the law,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   so that in Christ we have a punishment and we have a perfection that is complete.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And therefore, God is for us because we're in Christ,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   not because we have gone the way of law-keeping.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Now that leads us to a derivative meaning, I think, of legalism that may be even more common.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's the spirit and the life that flow from a failure to be humbled and broken and amazed
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and satisfied by the grace of God in Christ.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   There are all kinds of attitudes, right, of pride, demandingness, lack of mercy,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   lack of compassion, unkindness, impatience, and these have their root, don't they,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   in a heart that is not stunned by grace, not broken and humbled by grace,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   not joyfully filled with grace, and that creates a legal spirit.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So legalism is not just this conviction that we get right with God by keeping the law.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Legalism is used rightly, I think, biblically, if we say it's an attitude, a spirit,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   a disposition of all kinds of behaviors and feelings that are rooted in a failure to be amazed that I'm saved by grace,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   amazed that I'm accepted by God freely, melted and broken and humbled and filled with joy
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   because of what God has done, because that flavors all we do.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And the opposite of it is right there in Luke 18 in the Pharisee, standing by himself,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   he prayed, "God, I thank you that I'm not like these other men, extortors, unjust, adulterers,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   even like this tax collector."
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That's the spirit of a man who says right words.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He says, "Thank you," right? He says, "Thank you, God."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   That's the right thing to say, but he's not broken.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He's not stunned. He's not blown away by the fact that he is saved by grace, not according to his works.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So what we want, what I want in my life is not just to be free from a principled legalism,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   a theological legalism that says you get to heaven or you please God,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   you win his favor by keeping the law.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I want to have a gracious spirit, a gospel spirit, not a legal spirit that comes from a failure
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   to be amazed at my being saved by grace.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And for more on legalism, see the new edition of the book,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Brothers, We Are Not Professionals," and particularly chapter 26, which is titled,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   "Brothers Don't Fight Flesh Tanks With Pea Shooter Regulations."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And there's a similar sermon available, which is titled,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   "Flesh Tank and Pea Shooter Regulations," which was preached on January 17, 1982.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Both the chapter and the sermon are available through DesiringGod.org,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   along with thousands of free books, articles, sermons, and other resources from John Piper.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening.
