[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Today, my guest is Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Dr. Carhart-Harris is a distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   He's one of the leading researchers in the field of psychedelics and how they change neural circuitry in the brain.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   His laboratory is responsible for understanding, for instance, how psilocybin, also sometimes referred to as magic mushrooms,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   change neural circuitry in the brain such that new ideas and new forms of learning occur.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   His laboratory is also responsible for carrying out various clinical trials,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   which have demonstrated that appropriate dosages of psilocybin can alleviate major depression in more than 67% of people that take the drug.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Now, this is not to say that everybody should take psilocybin, and today's discussion describes both the clinical trials
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and why treatments with psychedelics in some cases work and in some cases do not work in order to treat major depression,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   as well as discussions around psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, sometimes also referred to as LSD,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   DMT, and how these change the brain and how those brain changes can relate to changes in mental health
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   as it relates to depression and other psychiatric challenges,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   as well as how psychedelics are being applied in order to change neural circuitry for sake of expanding different aspects of the human mind,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   including creativity, intelligence, and much more.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   During today's discussion, Dr. Carhart-Harris teaches us about the history of the study of psychedelics,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   as well as how the legislature, that is the laws surrounding psychedelics, are evolving in the United States and elsewhere
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   for the use of psychedelics to treat psychiatric challenges.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   By the end of today's discussion, you will have a thorough understanding of how psychedelics work,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   both in the short term during the actual journey or trip.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   In fact, much of my discussion today with Dr. Carhart-Harris talks about the different aspects of the psychedelic journey
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and how those relate to therapeutic outcomes.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   By the end of today's discussion, you will also understand the long-term effects of psychedelics,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   that is, how they can actually rewire the brain.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I've talked many times before on this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   One absolutely critical variable to getting excellent sleep is the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That is, in order to fall and stay deeply asleep at night,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   your body temperature needs to actually drop by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and alert,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   your body temperature has to increase by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   There are a lot of ways to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   but one of the best ways is to control the temperature of your actual mattress,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   the surface that you're sleeping on.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   With Eight Sleep, you can do this very easily.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   There's a simple-to-use app where you can program in the temperature of your mattress across the night.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So you can make it slightly cool at the beginning of the night,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   getting cooler, putting you into deep sleep, and then rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And all of that, in terms of its impact on your sleep, can be tracked within the same app.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for more than two years now,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   To try Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   for their exclusive Memorial Day savings, now through June 5th, 2023.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods affect your health
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   One of the most important factors in terms of your energy levels
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   are your blood glucose or blood sugar levels, as they're commonly called.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   With Levels, you can assess how different foods and activities
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   When I did this, it taught me several things.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   First of all, it taught me that certain foods
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   really spike my blood glucose levels.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And while spikes in blood glucose aren't always a bad thing,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I was able to assess how certain foods were spiking my blood glucose too much,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   such that I would have post-eating dips in energy levels.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And by removing those foods and substituting in other foods,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   it really evened out my energy levels.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Right now, Levels is offering an additional two free months of membership.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement that increases blood ketones.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And most people have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   but most people, including myself, are not on the ketogenic diet.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I and most people eat complex carbohydrates, fruits, and things of that sort,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   in addition to quality proteins, et cetera.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It turns out that even if you're not following a ketogenic diet,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   increasing your blood ketones can still have benefits.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So for instance, I use Ketone IQ anytime I want to do extended bouts
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   of focused work, preparing for podcasts, research, writing grants.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And if I ever want to exercise, but I don't have time to eat
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   or I don't want to have my gut full of food,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   taking Ketone IQ and thereby increasing my blood ketones
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   allows me to do cognitive work or physical workouts
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   without getting hungry and with plenty of energy and cognitive focus.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   If you'd like to try Ketone IQ,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm pleased to announce that I will be hosting two live events
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   in September of 2023.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The first live event will take place in Toronto on September 12th.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   The second live event will take place in Chicago on September 28th.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Both live events will include a lecture and a question and answer period
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and are entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   during which I will discuss tools and science related to mental health,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   physical health, and performance.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And I should mention that a lot of that content
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   will have absolutely no overlap with content covered previously
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   on the Huberman Lab podcast or elsewhere.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   If you're interested in attending either or both of these events,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   please go to hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and enter the code Huberman to get early access to tickets.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Once again, that's hubermanlab.com/tour
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and use the code Huberman to access tickets.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I hope to see you there.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   - Dr. Carhart-Harris, welcome.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I certainly have known who you are for quite a while
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   because I place you in this very small
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   but very special and important category of researchers
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   who has been pioneering the use of psychedelics
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   for the treatment of specific clinical conditions
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and really carrying the torch for essentially the entire field.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So I want to start with a voice of gratitude
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and say thank you for doing this incredibly important work.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Could you tell us a little bit about what psychedelics are?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   In fact, I'm curious as to how the name psychedelic ever came to be
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and what you think they potentially reveal about the workings of the brain.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And then we'll talk about the clinical applications.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Sure. Well, even that one is a kind of hot one
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   because opinions differ on how to define psychedelic.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But perhaps a good starting place is to start with the etymology.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Where did the word come from?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And it was a Brit, excommunicated,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   living in Canada, Humphrey Osmond,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   who was due to present a paper at a National Academy of Sciences meeting
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   on psychotomemetics, drugs that mimic aspects of psychosis in their action.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And certain drugs like mescaline, let's see 1956 and LSD,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   were on the bill and he felt dissatisfied
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   with them being under this category of psychotomemetics
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and felt that the signature psychological effects of these compounds
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   went beyond just mimicking psychotic symptoms.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And so he wanted to find a more apt term to speak to,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   in a sense the principal component of their action.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And he jotted down a few different possibilities,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   about a dozen or so I think,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and one of them was psychedelic actually it started as
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   and ended up being psychedelic.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And he had a correspondence going on with another Brit,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   also living in the US, Aldous Huxley,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   where they were playing with some terms to refer to these compounds.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And in the end Osmond won with psychedelic
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and he had this little ditty of
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   "To fathom hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   That's where he put the disclaimer in.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And so what does that mean?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's two ancient Greek words, psyche means the human mind
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   or if we're being actually true to the ancient Greek it means soul.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And then the other component means to make clear or to make visible
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   or to make manifest or to reveal.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So all of those work.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And it's a neologism, it's a made-up word
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   but it does have that ancient Greek origin
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   and it's speaking to this principle
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   that these compounds reveal aspects of the psyche,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   of the human mind, the soul, that are ordinarily not entirely visible.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And so that's the etymology and it's wonderfully poetic
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   but I happen to think it's also very accurate.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's a useful term because it's sort of, you might say,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   valence non-specific.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It doesn't say you're going to have a great time
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   or that you're going to go mad.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It's more that it reveals a psyche and it could be hellish
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   but it could be heavenly.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so that's the etymology and also a bit of the psychology
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and sort of, you know, pointing to the phenomenology,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   the subjective experience.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   But there's also a pharmacology here
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and quite recently there was put out a consensus statement
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   about psychedelics that's really referring to what we call
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   classic psychedelics to say that these are all compounds
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   that work on a particular receptor in the brain,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   the serotonin 2A receptor
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   and that's another way that we could define these compounds.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I said this one's a little hot
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   because I'm of the view that while the pharmacology is really useful,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   how the drugs work chemically, you can't avoid the phenomenology
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and if we're true to the etymology, where the term came from,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   then we must recognize and we cannot neglect
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   the subject of experience.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   - Thank you for that beautiful description
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   of what brought us to today
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   in terms of using the word psychedelics
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and now it's thrown around all the time.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   - Yeah, too much.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   - Yeah, too much and I'm guessing, well not guessing,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I'm certain that it's also used to describe many compounds
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   that don't touch the 5-HT2A, the serotonin 2A receptor.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So there is a broader categorization by most people
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and it'll be interesting to see
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   where all the nomenclature and naming goes.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   For the time being, I'd love for you to tell us
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   a bit more about this idea that psychedelics,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   however one defines them,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   can reveal something about the mind
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   that can't be revealed otherwise.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Are you talking about the subconscious?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I mean, psychologists and most famously Freud,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   and also Jung and also neuroscientists, I think,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   think about subconscious processing.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I think perhaps the most salient example for me
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   that's outside the realm of anything psychedelic
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   would be blind sight.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   This phenomenon that you take people that are blind
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   but still have some connectivity in their brain
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and you present them a board with a computer screen
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   with different number of dots on each side
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and you say, how many dots are on each side of the screen?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And they say, what do you mean?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   They're trying to guess
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and their guess rate is accurate
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   far more than chance would predict.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   So they have so-called blind sight
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and people have said, well,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   this is the subconscious revealing itself.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   There's no psychedelic drug involved
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   but what you're describing is a pharmacologic induced state
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   that reveals something that normally,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   should we assume, is masked
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   or that we are oblivious to
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   even though it's expressing itself?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   What does it mean for these drugs
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   to be revealing something about the workings of the mind
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   that would not be obvious to us otherwise?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Yeah, so the example of blind sight is interesting
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   but it's different.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Blind sight would be referring to non-conscious processing,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   maybe implicit processing,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   so stuff going on in the mind in perception
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   in a sense that is below the threshold
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   of conscious awareness.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   But yet is influencing you.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   So it's kind of related but it's different.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   So in depth psychology, psychoanalysis,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   psychodynamic psychology,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and so on,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   we talk about the unconscious
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and there it's more about the kind of blood and guts
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   of the human condition, the human nature,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   both the personal unconscious
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   so things that you might not want
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   to necessarily be conscious of because it's painful.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So that's the repression aspect,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   pushing it out of conscious awareness.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Repressed memories in particular?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Yeah, like traumatic memories,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   difficult relationships.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   It could be complex trauma,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   not necessarily just a specific index trauma
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   but a series of trauma.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And then you have the collective unconscious
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   which was really Carl Jung's contribution
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   to say that there's a transpersonal quality
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   to the unconscious.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   There's aspects about humans,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   not just this individual human.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   There's aspects to our minds,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   our psyches that are not fully available
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   to conscious awareness
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   but can come up in certain states.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   You know, psychoanalysis went crazy for dreaming
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   as their royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   That was Freud.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   But we now know with psychedelics
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and this was what drew me into the area
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   was discovering literature
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   that was speaking to this particular action,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   the psychedelic action,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   and was saying that when these drugs
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   like chilis-D, psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   when they're used in psychotherapy,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   material comes up that maybe may have been repressed
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   that is of therapeutic value
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and awareness and insight of this material
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   seems to catalyze the therapeutic process
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   with strong emotional release,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   these cathartic experiences.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And insights, you know,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   whether they're insights that are personal
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   or whether they're transpersonal.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   But for me this is really
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   where the meat of it is with psychedelics
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and classic psychedelics in particular,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   the likes of compounds like LSD and psilocybin.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I would say that if it wasn't for this action
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   by classic psychedelics,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   we wouldn't be so interested in psychedelics.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I think if we only had compounds
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   like ketamine, MDMA, cannabis,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   that could be said, broadly speaking,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   to be psychedelic-like,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I don't think it necessarily would have captured
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   the world's attention as psychedelics are right now.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I actually think there's a major gap to fill
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   is this principle action of the classic psychedelics.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   What does this mean that I'm referring to?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Psyche revealing, what is that?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And I suppose where I'm going with this is
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   what is that in terms of the biology as well?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   What's going on in the brain and the body
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   when people become aware of things
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   that previously they weren't fully aware of?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   - I'd like to talk about some of the clinical trials
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   that you've been involved with.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   In particular, looking at psilocybin,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   as you mentioned,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   the principal hallucinatory psychedelic agent
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   in magic mushrooms.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I'd like to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   just so that everyone's on the same page.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I've read the papers that you've published
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   and that others have published in this area,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   and typically the dosages used in these trials
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   are 25 milligrams of psilocybin,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and we talk about one recent trial in particular
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   that compared 25 to 10 milligrams
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   to more frequent use of very small amounts,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   one milligram over three weeks, for instance.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   However, when people talk about magic mushrooms,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   they often talk about gram doses of the mushroom
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   because I'm assuming that they contain
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   milligram dosages of psilocybin.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Here we're not encouraging use of any kind.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   These are clinical trials,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   but there's a clarity of understanding
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   what is the conversion typically?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Like one gram of magic mushrooms
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   will contain how many milligrams of psilocybin on average?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Because what I'm trying to do here
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   is calibrate people to this idea
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   of microdosing versus macrodosing,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and that's fairly straightforward to do
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   with respect to the clinical trials,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   but then in a lot of the lay discussion around this,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   you hear about heroic doses versus microdoses,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and so I think there's a lot of confusion.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   So if you would, educate us on this idea
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   of what's a microdose
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   and perhaps also how many milligrams of psilocybin
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   are contained in a gram of "magic mushrooms."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Sure. Well, a microdose is,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   neither of these are that simple,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   but they're fun, it's a fun challenge.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But microdose, one definition is that
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   it's a dose of typically a classic psychedelic
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   like LSD or psilocybin
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   that has sub-perceptible psychedelic effects.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It doesn't put you into a noticeable altered state
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   of consciousness that feels like you're tripping.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And if that was LSD,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   it looks as though the threshold is around about,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   let's see, 10, 11, 12 micrograms.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Micrograms.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I want to be very clear here, micrograms.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   So 10 micrograms of LSD,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   are you saying will not induce visual hallucinations
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   in most people?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   That's threshold level.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   That's about the level that some people
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   who are sensitive could feel it.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But if you were to talk to the microdosing gurus,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   they might say that that's kind of the ballpark
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   for an LSD dose that you would consider a microdose
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and then you would take sort of semi-regularly.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   It's typically something like one day on, one day off
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   or one day on, two days off, this kind of thing.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   There's different protocols.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And yeah, so some like Jim Faderman,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   one of the popularizers of microdosing.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I think would say that a true microdose
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   should be sub-perceptible.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   You shouldn't feel it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Yet the assumption is it's going to change you in some way
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   on a kind of trait level, more than a state level.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Maybe behaviorally.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   And the typical story goes it will improve well-being
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   and maybe, maybe it could improve certain aspects
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   of cognition, say related to creative thinking.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I emphasize that maybe there,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   because that's another angle with microdosing.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   We're kind of waiting for some compelling evidence.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   As things stand right now,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I'd say we lack that compelling evidence.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   There's some suggestive stuff,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   but often the study designs aren't that strong.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It's really hard to do a study with microdosing
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   because you need to have permission
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   to give people a microdose that, for practical reasons,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   they would go home with.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And otherwise, you're requiring them to be in the lab,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   say three times a week for X number of weeks
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   to meet the criteria of a course of microdosing,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   which might be two or three times a week for, say, a month.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And that's a hard thing to do in a lab study.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's expensive.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You'd need to do that against a suitable control,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   so a placebo control.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And there is a study that's been done in New Zealand
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   that has some interesting preliminary data
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   that did, I think, kind of did the design right.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   But it hasn't been published yet.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   We've seen some positive findings presented
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   around improvements in mood,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   but it's a bit early to get too excited about that.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Needs to go through peer review and all that.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But as things stand, the evidence is pretty thin,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   and we have to be honest about that.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   We did quite a creative study with my colleagues at Imperial,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   the guy leading that, Balash Shigeti, Hungarian chap,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   did a really creative design, very much his brainchild.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   He instructed people to do their own blinding,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   their own placebo-controlled blinding
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   of their own microdosing.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So this was a classic citizen science study,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   like do-it-yourself science,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   where they would get their LSD tabs and chop them up,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   put them into gel capsules, opaque,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   have other capsules that are the placebos
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   that they just close, empty capsule.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And then there was a whole barcode scan technique
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   so that you kind of shuffle them up, you know,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   but they've got the barcode in, the QR code,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   so you can break the code later on,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   but once you've shuffled them up,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   you no longer know which ones have the microdose in
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   and which ones are empty.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   - Was this LSD? - This was LSD.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   He also tried it with mushrooms,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   and what he did with the mushrooms was
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   people would burp sometimes, they'd belch,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   and then they'd have this mushroom taste.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   So then he instructed people
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   to get some non-psychoactive mushroom material to put in.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   - So it's really-- - Not an easy study.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   - Not an easy study.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And it was, I love that kind of science,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   you know, real creative, first mover kind of science.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And the results were fascinating
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   because the short story is that the microdosing
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   didn't compellingly beat the placebo.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   - It did not. - It didn't.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And he controlled, because he asked,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   he controlled for expectancy.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   So people's positive expectancy,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   which is in a sense the vehicle
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   that carries the placebo response,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   it's why you have a placebo,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   is that positive expectancy can drive
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   a therapeutic effect to, you know, a large extent.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So he measured that pre-trial
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and then used it to kind of correct for the response.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And how did it work?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Those who got a placebo
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   but thought they got a microdose
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   did as well as those who thought they got a microdose
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and did get a microdose.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   So it was the bigger effect,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   the majority of the effect was in thinking
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   that you got a microdose.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   So in a sense it was a victory
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   for the power of the placebo response.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And it's created all sorts of controversy.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   People don't want to believe it,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   you know, that kind of thing.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But that's the beauty of science, isn't it?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   That science is not about what you want to believe.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That right there is the beauty of science, really.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   - I love that experiment.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Kudos to them.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I'm not going to attempt to say his last name correctly.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   - I tried, yeah.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I probably made a mess of it.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   - No, no, I think you got it.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   You were involved in a clinical trial
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   that was published last year
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   comparing 25 milligrams of psilocybin
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   to 10 milligrams of psilocybin
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   to a drug called escitalopram.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   - Yeah, Lexapro, yeah.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   - And this one milligram over three week dosage.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I'm wanting to discuss the results of that study a bit
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and some of the other trials that you've done
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   involving psilocybin for depression,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   the treatment of depression.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Could we calibrate ourselves?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   25 milligrams of psilocybin,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   is that what wouldn't,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   it's going to be a perceptible dose, presumably.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Hallucinations and all that.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And is that what one would find in,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I'm guessing here, if I'm accurate,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   this does not mean that I have experience here,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   but two grams of mushrooms?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   - More than that, we think, yeah.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Sorry, I missed that one.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Went off on a tangent.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   But yeah, 25 milligrams of psilocybin would be,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   we don't know and it's important that I say that
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   because I wouldn't want people to hear my answer here
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   and then use it to calibrate their own dosing of mushrooms
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   and get it way off.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So it's guesswork and I would love to see someone
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   do a proper study on it
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and look at the psilocybin content
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   in a given mass of psilocybin mushrooms, magic mushrooms.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   But to my knowledge, that hasn't really been done.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Someone like Paul Stamets would give a better answer here,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   but I think the percentage within the mushroom mass
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   of psilocybin in the mushroom mass
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and psilocin, which is the metabolite of psilocybin,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   in the 1%, a little bit higher maybe, range.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   - Okay, so one gram, 1,000 milligrams of magic mushroom
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   would contain about 10 milligrams of psilocybin.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Is that right?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   - Broadly speaking, yeah.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   - Okay, great.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   That helps calibrate.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And I think, again, just allows the layperson
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   to understand a bit more of where we're headed
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   with these psilocybin trials and the results.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   We don't have to restrict our discussion
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   to just that one clinical trial,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   but if we include that one
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and compare it to some of the other trials that you've done,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I mean, your laboratory is seeing phenomenal,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   in my opinion, phenomenal results
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   in the treatment of otherwise intractable depression,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   major depression, which so many people suffer from,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   from two, I suppose they're two sessions
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   using psilocybin in these ranges of 10 to 25 milligrams.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Do I have that correct?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   - Yes.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   - Okay, could we talk a little bit
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   about what people typically experience
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   during those sessions
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   that allows this phenomenal transformation
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   of mood and state and trait as well?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And I'm especially interested in whether or not
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   is the experience during those sessions
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   that is the trigger that's necessary
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   for the transformation from a depressed
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   to a non-depressed state?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Because the impulse is to think it is,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   that what one thinks and sees and hallucinates
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and hears is so vital.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   But of course, these drugs can create neuroplasticity changes
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   in our neural wiring, presumably for long periods of time.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So what are your thoughts on the experience itself?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And maybe for those who have not done these compounds before,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   you can explain a little bit about what's typical for people
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and what you think is leading to that incredible
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   positive and pervasive change in mood, state, and trait.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   - I would say that it's more than impulse
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that is leading us to think that the experience is important.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   It's really data and converging evidence now.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   So independent teams, independent studies
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   are converging on the magnitude of certain kinds of experience.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Rated, yes, with subjective rating scales
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   is predicting therapeutic outcomes
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   pretty strongly and very reliably.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so that's guiding us.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Now, could you say, well, maybe those experiences
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   are some kind of epiphenomenon of, say,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   a central brain action?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Well, absolutely, but then all experience
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   is an epiphenomenon by that principle.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And yet we care about it, you know?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And it matters to us and in our human relations with each other.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   So I think it does matter to a human being
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   when they're in, say, a psilocybin therapy session
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and as the drug effects begin to come on
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and the body starts to feel a little strange and tingly
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and there's some initial anxiety.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And then in their mind's eye,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   they start to notice patterns and maybe colors
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and then maybe those patterns deepen and they're dynamic
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and they have this fascinating organic quality.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Are the patients in your studies typically using an eye mask?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   So they're in the eye mask, so eyes closed.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   That's why you said mind's eye as opposed to
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   looking out into the clinical setting.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Yes, and that's one of the major differences
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   between psychedelic therapy versus taking a psychedelic,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   is you shut your eyes, you know?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And it's a world away from taking a psychedelic,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   yeah, a rave or something, you know?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   In a sense, good luck with that.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   But in psychedelic therapy, yeah, it's, you know,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   settled conditions, there's music playing
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and what I'm describing here is very much the default.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   There's actually, you know, very little variability
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   between the different sites that have done this work
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   on these conditions.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Typically it's two people, ideally mental health professionals,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   at least one who's a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   or some other kind of psychotherapist or psychiatric nurse.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But ideally two who meet those criteria
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   with a individual who's ingested the drug
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and music playing throughout,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   a kind of runway into taking the drug and then throughout,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   so there's continuity.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Music with lyrics or without lyrics?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Without lyrics to begin with
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and the music typically is spacious to begin with
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and then builds and becomes atmospheric.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   There might be, I don't know, some tribal drums
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   in the distance or something as it develops
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   or like the sound of a bird in the distance,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   you know, a bird's call.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And then as it gets into more stronger drug effects,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   the music starts to coax emotion
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and very intentionally, you know, strings,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   for example, would come in and it would be an interesting experiment
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and one that we'd love to do, actually,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   to see whether if you were to pull that out,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   whether the psychedelic experience would be as emotionally intense
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   as it is in psychedelic therapy
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   when you have music there as a default.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And across the board, people should find this remarkable
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   because it kind of is.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   All of the published studies that are now, you know,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   having such an impact on psychiatry and beyond
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   have music there as a staple component
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and we just take it as assumption that it needs to be.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I tend to share that assumption
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   but it's remarkable that it hasn't been tested properly
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   but it's there.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And, you know, if you were to run with that
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and if you were, you know, had a kind of critical agenda,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   well, this is music therapy, you know.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Why are you making all this fuss about psychedelics?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   It's music that's there in all of these trials
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   with all these fantastic findings.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   So there is something to that, you know,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and this will team me up probably to talk about psychedelic therapy
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   being a combination treatment.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   We have a hyphen between the two
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   because I share the hypothesis,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   the assumption that should be tested better,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   that there is a positive interaction between the two,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   that there's a synergy between the two.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   - That's why it's psychedelic therapy with a hyphen,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   just like Carhartt-Heron.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   They've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   once or usually twice a day
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Our gut is very important.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   To get the five free travel packs
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   This is extremely useful to hear
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   because I think most people think,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   okay, psychedelic, whether or not
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   they have experience with psychedelics or not,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   get some visual hallucinations,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   some auditory hallucinations, some synesthesia,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   some visual auditory blending,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   somatic sensation, you know, rubbing a surface
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and being able to elicit the sounds
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   in one's mind, of course, et cetera.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But so seldom do we actually hear about
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   the specifics of these clinical trials
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   in a way that, for instance, points to music
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   as one of the perhaps key variables.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Now, you mentioned that as people enter
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   these psychedelic states that there's
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   a little bit of initial anxiety.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   About a year and a half ago,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I had a discussion with Dr. Matthew Johnson
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   who's running some psilocybin trials
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   at Johns Hopkins, as you know.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And he mentioned the critical importance,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   at least in his mind, to this idea
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   of the patient "letting go" or allowing
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   the experience to take them someplace mentally
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   as opposed to trying to constrain
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   their sensory and cognitive experience.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I'm curious what your reflections
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   are on that idea and why it might
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   be so valuable clinically.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And this ties back to this,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   earlier discussion we were having
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   about the unconscious or about psychedelics
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   revealing something that's there all the time
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   but that we don't have access to.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And again, I'm struggling to find
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   the right language for this because
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   we don't really have a neural mechanism
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   like top-down inhibition or something
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   like that to explain how this, you know,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   unconscious might be uncorked
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   in the psychedelic experience.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   But to make it quite simple and direct,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   how important do you think it really is
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   for the patient to feel like they are
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   "letting go" and what in the world
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   is letting go in biological terms?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Yeah, yeah. Well, I think we'll get there
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   in terms of having the neural correlates
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   of the mind revealing itself to itself,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   you know, the emergence of the unconscious
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   into consciousness or unconscious material
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   into conscious awareness.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   It's a wonderful challenge.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   It's a huge challenge,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   but it's a challenge to embrace.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And letting go very much is, again,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   a staple component of how the different teams
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   do this work in terms of encouraging
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   a willingness to let go.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And when we started out doing our depression work
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and did that first trial,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   it was the first trial of a psychedelic illness
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   in formerly diagnosed depression, you know,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   where that was the target population,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   a depressed population.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   It was the first modern study to do that.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And we visited Hopkins, our friends there,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and were mentored on how to do the guiding,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Bill Richards, Mary Cosimano.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   They were just so brilliant.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   And, you know, wise in their guidance to us
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   as to how to do the guiding in our trial.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And so this phrase of trust, let go, be open,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   you'll hear a lot.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   I don't know who fairly it should be attributed to,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   but I would attribute it to Bill, Bill Richards.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Yeah, everything's borrowed.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   You probably get it.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   You probably got it from someone else,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   but it's such a key principle.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And it's almost like a mantra
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   that you're trying to instill in people trust,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   let go, be open.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And those different components
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   where the trust is about therapeutic rapport,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   that again, you know, this goes beyond just intuition now.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   We've formally measured therapeutic rapport.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   We do it even with just a single item,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   a visual analog scale item,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   the subjective rating scale item.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   On the morning of dosing,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   and we find that it's a significant predictor
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   of the quality of the experience
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   that you have under the drug
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   in the psychedelic therapy,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and then the therapeutic outcomes
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   X weeks or months later.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   So very powerful kind of chain
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   of sort of predictive components there.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   But trust, essentially important.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And again, not just intuition,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   but the data pointing to that.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Let go.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   There's a readiness to surrender,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   to let go, to not resist.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And we do measure that too
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   and see that it's predictive of response.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And then the being open
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   is about a willingness to go there,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   to confront, to be inquisitive.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Something that's easier said
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   than done can be terrifying.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   When you're dealing
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   with a very vulnerable population,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   it's probably more the rule
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   than the exception that they're carrying
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   some significant adversity,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   life adversity or frank trauma
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   that they've suffered.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And so that message of be open,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   be willing to confront
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   and to go there is really powerful.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And that's how it plays out.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   And often there is struggle.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   There's something going on
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   that is I don't want to be feeling this,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   make it stop.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   That can be nightmarish at times,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   but it's very, very strong.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And with these big doses that we give,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   it's very strong.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And actually a student
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   that I've worked with,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I think now doing a PhD,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Ari Brauer is working
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   on a fantastic project
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   characterizing the different phases
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   of the psychedelic experience
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   where the early phase is dominated
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   by negative emotions
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   and negatively valenced feelings
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   of anxiety and struggle.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And then it's a different story
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   in the latter half.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   - Could I ask about that?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   First of all, I think that's fascinating
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   and important to analyze
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and again, I'm delighted here
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   because people typically hear
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   about a psychedelic journey,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   but we never really hear
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   about the kind of stereotypic components
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   of the beginning, middle and end
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   of that journey.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   We know that there's a peak
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   and that there's a kind
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   of a parachuting down and et cetera.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   But when you say that typically
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   there's an anxiety,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   maybe some negative valence
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   in the early stage,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   do you mean about the sensations
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   that people are remembering?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Likewise for the positive phase
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   of the psychedelic journey or trip,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   are people, do they still call it a trip?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   - Yeah. - All right.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   I guess we'll use trip
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   for the psychedelic trip.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Are people feeling positive
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   about the experience like,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   ah, like there's been some sort
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   of breakthrough or they're
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   in a calmer state or is it
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   that they tend to be focusing
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   on prior events that were positive?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So in other words,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   we're reading through
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   of some concept that comes
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   to mind for people,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   maybe about an earlier trauma
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   or maybe about a sense of self
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   or a sense of other forgiveness.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   It could be any of these things,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   but what do we know about
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   the kind of finer details of all that?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   - I would say the initial struggle
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   is more against the general
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   drug effects than pinning it
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   on something specific.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   It's more that normal waking
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and consciousness, we have a sense,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   generally speaking, if we're well
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   or well enough, a sense
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   of assuredness about what's what.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   There's a table here and so on.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And we have that assuredness
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   to an extent about ourselves as well.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   It might be illusory, but we have it.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   And what the drug's doing is
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   it's breaking down all of that
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   and it's scary as hell.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   And if it's a big dose,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   it's just like human nature
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   to rage against that a bit
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and a bit like dying.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I don't want this.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It feels like I could be dying.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   - I might lose my mind.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   - Yeah, that too. - And never come back.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   - Those two are the classics is,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   oh, but I might know
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   that I've taken a psychedelic
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   and I might even know
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   a bit about psychedelics,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   but I still fear that I'm gonna go mad.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Or that I know they,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   generally speaking,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   these drugs don't have
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   a high fertility risk.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   I still think I'm gonna die.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   And it's just, it's very palpable
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and that comes up.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   So yeah, that's,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   I mean, those are the core fears
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   that those two,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   and very reliably that comes up.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And it's really like a basic drug action.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's dose dependent,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   but it's a basic drug action
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   that is forcing something
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   about the nature of the mind
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and the way it's made up
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   that makes it feel that way.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Oh, but it feels like I'm losing my mind
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   or it feels like I could lose my mind
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   or that I could go insane
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   or that maybe I'm dying here
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   and this is bad.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   - You've talked many times before
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and have done really wonderful work
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   looking at the changes
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   in communication between different brain areas
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   while people are under the influence of psychedelics.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   And I think the gestalt of those data,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   is that compared to the non-psychedelic state
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   that under psychedelic influence,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   there is far more,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   let's just call it interconnectivity
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   or communication between brain areas
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   that typically aren't communicating,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   which probably is not surprising to people
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   given the subjective effects of these drugs.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   What is the evidence
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   that after the psychedelic journey is over
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   that some or perhaps all of that enhanced communication
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   across brain areas is maintained?
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And if so, what role do you feel that could play
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   in these incredible positive therapeutic outcomes?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   - Yeah.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   So we've had some recent findings in that direction
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   where yes, it's true.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   And the picture that says a thousand words
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   that some people might be familiar with
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   are these two circles,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   a project that we did in collaboration
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   with some researchers
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   where ordinarily the communication
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   is going on within systems.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Like other regions of the visual system
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   will be speaking mostly within the visual system.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   There'll be a kind of cliquishness
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   or a modularity to the quality
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   of the communication in the brain.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   And then the cool finding with psilocybin
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   was the first paper is that the communication,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   yes, it sort of transcends these modules
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   and becomes much more intermodular,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   crossing different modalities.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And that effect correlated with the magnitude
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   of the subjective effects,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and then we replicated it with LSD
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   using different methods.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And a new paper will come out soon
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   where DMT showing a similar effect.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   It's a bit of a debate
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   about what regions are most implicated,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   but the general effect of an increase
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   in global functional connectivity
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   is what we call it,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   or global communication in the brain.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   - And this is while under the influence
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   of these drugs. - This is under the influence.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   - So putting people into a brain scanner
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   while they are under the influence of the drug.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Is that right? - Yes, yes.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   - That itself must be quite an experience
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   given that these scanners are small tubes.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   You've got a bite bar in your mouth.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   That's quite a study.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   - You don't always have a bite bar,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   at least with the psychedelics,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   but yeah, you've got to keep your head still
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   and you have the loud MR scanner noise going.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   But because it's regular,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   there aren't too many surprises.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   So it's actually surprisingly tolerable.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   - And you're in a hospital setting,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   so you're not worried about what would happen
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   if you had a cardiac event or something.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   - Most people generally tolerate that setting quite well,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   surprisingly well.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   But yeah, we do all that,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   and yes, we do see that opening up
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   of the communication across systems in the brain.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   And it does speak to kind of intuition
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   about the subjective experience
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   that different modalities might be blending with each other.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   - Sorry for interrupting, but I have to ask,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   have you thought that the activation of the serotonin 2A receptor
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   is what's responsible for the increased communication
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   between brain areas that under normal circumstances
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   would not be communicated?
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   - Yes, so there's a few reasons why some modeling work,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   computational modeling work that first identifies
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   where the 2A receptor is
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   and then looks at models its basic effects
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   on neural activity will recapitulate the,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   or recreate the effect that we see
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   actually in the data with the scanning.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   So doing the computational modeling,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   you can see the same effect by knowing
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   where the key receptors are
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   and then making them do a certain thing
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   that we know psychedelics do.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   - I can imagine two possibilities,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   and I think it's important to distinguish between these two.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   One possibility is that the activation
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   of this serotonin 2A receptor leads to increased connectivity
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   and thereby auditory and visual hallucinations emerge,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   changed patterns of thinking emerge, et cetera.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   That's sort of the obvious interpretation,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   but the scientist in me has to ask,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   is it possible that all of that increased connectivity
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   is occurring and yet that is a distinct phenomenon
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   layered on top of some other effect
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   like drugs impacting access to the unconscious, hallucinations.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   In other words, is it the increased connectivity
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   that's leading to the subjective experience
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   or are those two things happening in parallel?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   - Well, they happen in parallel and they map to each other,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   but the question of causality, what causes what,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   is the tricky thing where I would suggest
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   that the causality is circular,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   that they influence each other,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   and this gets a bit philosophical,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   but it kind of matters because otherwise,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   there's a trap that it's easy to fall into
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   where you're thinking that it's all about the brain action
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   causing the subjective experience,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   and that's typically what we do in cognitive neuroscience.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   It's kind of like the sort of first port of call
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   kind of materialist approach,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   but one can be a materialist essentially,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   but still appreciate that circular causality
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   that mind also interacts with brain,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   and it's so hard to pick the two apart
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   and there is a kind of essential dualism
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   where subjective experience is a thing in and of itself,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   but that's not to divorce it from what's going on
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   on the biological level.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   - The reason I ask is because as I understand it,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   nowadays there's a bit of a movement
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   within the scientific community that studies psychedelics
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   to develop drugs that can essentially cure
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   or alleviate many of the symptoms of depression or trauma
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   that are built off our understanding
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   of how psychedelics like psilocybin,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and here I'll throw MDMA in there,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   although classically not a psychedelic.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It kind of gets lumped in.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   We can get back to that later,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   but that do not produce hallucinations
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   or massive changes in subjective experience.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Actually, I think this is what initially
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   got us into conversation on Twitter
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   is I had learned about this paper
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   published out of a group at UC Davis
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   that essentially modifying psychedelics
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   so that they have potential therapeutic application
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   for the treatment of depression,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   but zero hallucinogenic properties.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   And I thought, wow, this is going to be
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   a very controversial thing in the world, right?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Because the history of psychedelics, as you pointed out,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   is being one of people accessing different modes of thinking,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   feeling, seeing things, letting go, trust, et cetera,
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   a therapeutic relationship.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   And here we have, I don't want to say pharma
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   because it's not really pharma,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   but we have laboratories who are trying
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   to tease apart the activation of receptors
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   independent of all that subjective experience
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   in order to essentially treat the same conditions.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   I'd love for you to comment on this,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   where you think it might be going
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   and whether or not you think that's the right
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   or the wrong approach, if it has any validity at all.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   - It is pharma, it's just smaller pharma,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   sort of startup pharma.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   - Okay, so because pharma would like to have drugs
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   that can cure depression, but don't make people hallucinate.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Is that correct? - Oh, they would.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   And patients might, and the system would love it
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   because the system is used to it.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   It's medicine. - Right.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   And it doesn't give this mental imagery
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   of the summer of love in San Francisco
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   or of kaleidoscope eyes, right?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   It's more, you could imagine the more,
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I have to be careful with my wording here,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   those who would not be inclined toward that
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   might embrace a therapeutic that is strictly effective
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   at treating depression with no hallucinations.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   - Yeah, and it doesn't look like an individual
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   lying on a sofa, crying their eyes out.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   - Yeah. - About the life
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   that they've lived and that deep catharsis
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   being life transforming.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   They're very different from that model.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   I'm skeptical of it for a few reasons.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   And one is that I can't see the logic.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   I can't see the pieces fit in a way that's compelling.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   And I'm also skeptical 'cause I think
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   it could easily be wishful thinking
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   because of that point that patients would like it
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   and the system would like it.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   And I just, you gotta bear that in mind as well.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   So wouldn't it be convenient if it were true
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   and you could get the therapeutic action
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   without the psychedelic effects?
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   - Well, in a way, that's a little bit
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   what microdosing seems to be designed to do.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Like you said, take dosages that are below
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   that perceptual or awareness of some effect threshold
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   over a longer period of time in an attempt
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   to ping the circuits or alter the circuits
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   but not hallucinate, not have a catharsis.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   - So if microdosing can do that and it's sub-perceptible,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   then microdosing isn't a psychedelic action
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   because where's the psychedelic action?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   When psychedelic, when defined means psyche revealing,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   you're not getting that effect.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   You might be getting the pharmacology.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   You might be getting some direct serotonin
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   to a receptor agonism that could be driving
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   a therapeutic response but you can get that
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   with SSRIs as well.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   And so my point is, what's new?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Okay, maybe it's a bit new and people are now developing
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   direct two-way agonists rather than indirect
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   through a serotonin releaser like the selective
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   The SSRIs like Lexapro.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   - Are there any SSRIs that selectively agonize,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   which folks by the way means activate in a good way.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Agony sounds terrible to those in foreign might think
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   that mean that disrupt but that can activate
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   the serotonin two-way receptor.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Are there any drugs that will do that
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   that are not psychedelic?
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I'm not aware of any but then again,
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   I'm not a psychopharmacologist.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   - There are, I mean are there any that are licensed
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   and used as medicines in psychiatry?
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   I actually had this debate recently on social media
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and I couldn't see a compelling example.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   I saw two-way agonists that were used for other things.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   You have a compound like Lisseride used in treating
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Parkinson's but actually it's more of a dopamine agonist.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   - Right, so they're always hitting other things, right?
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   - They're always tapping other neurotransmitters.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   - Or they're being used for other things.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   So is there a selective serotonin
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   two-way receptor stimulator, an agonist,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   that isn't psychedelic, that is therapeutic in psychiatry
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   and the answer firmly is no.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Will they develop one?
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Well, for patient's sake, I hope so
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   because it would be great.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Let's wait and see.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   If they do, I doubt it will be psychedelic
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   or have much to do with psychedelic therapy
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   and it would be much more like the system we're used to
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   of chronic pharmacotherapy, take your drug every day.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Let's hope they find it and it works for patient's sake
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   but as things stand right now, I'm a little skeptical.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Now, some of the findings that are being seen
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   that are really exciting, fantastic work being done
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   showing things like increases in the communication components
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   of neurons, dendritic growth, spine growth,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   synaptic spine growth.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   - Yeah, by the way, folks, just I'll interrupt
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   not necessarily spine, the bone, not the cerebral column
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   but spines are these little tiny twigs with bulbs
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   on the end of neurons that allow for communication points
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   in neurons.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   So neuroplasticity is often associated with growth
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   of dendrites and spines and so forth
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   which is what Robin's referring to.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   That reminds me and I just want to make sure
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   that we close the hatch on the earlier answer
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   because I interrupted you.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   Is the increased connectivity or communication
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   between brain areas that's observed
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   while people are under the influence of the psychedelic
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   also observed later after the effects of the drug wear off?
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   And then I'll just throw in another question there
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   on the topic now, to what extent do we think
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   that neuroplasticity, structural changes in neurons,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   functional changes in neurons are responsible for that
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and how long does that last?
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Let's say I come into your clinic.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   I'm a subject in your experiment.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   I'd come in in the morning.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   I'd do my psychedelic journey five or six hours later.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   I'm parachuting back to reality as we call it
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   and then I go home, increase connectivity lasts for how long
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   and how long are the structural brain changes occurring?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Well, you're asking fantastic questions
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   and partly because we don't have the answer yet
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   but we do have some data and so we have looked at,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   first of all, in a sense the functional plasticity
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   or what we assume it to be
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   or at least the functional changes,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   the increase in communication across systems,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   that increase in global connectivity,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   functional connectivity.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Do we see it after the trip?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   We know we see it during the trip,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   pretty well replicated,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   correlating with intense drug effects.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Do we see it after the trip?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Well, the answer is we've seen it
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   in two different depression cohorts,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   psilocybin therapy for depression.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   In one study where we looked the next day,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   we saw it, a kind of residual effect
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   similar to what you see acutely being seen the next day
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   and then in a subsequent study,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   we saw it also three weeks later.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   So we've seen it in two independent data sets,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   this decrease in modularity is how we measure it.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It's the same thing essentially.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   Broadly speaking, it's the same thing,
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   an increase in global connectivity,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   functional connectivity and actually unpublished,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   we've seen it in healthy volunteers
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   on a correlational level,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   not on an absolute change level
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   but if you look at its relationship
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   to a mental health outcome,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   and this is an important thing to stress
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   with the depression work,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   we saw a relationship between the magnitude of that change,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   the decrease in modularity
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   or increase in global connectivity
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   and the improvement in symptom severity.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   So interesting.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   And just to state it a different way,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   so what Robin's referring to is when you say modularity,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   as neuroscientists we think of
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   the different modular networks of the brain
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   that the eye talks to a region of the thalamus
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   involved in vision which talks to the visual cortex
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   which eventually converges with auditory information of course
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   but there's a separation or modularity of function.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   This increased connectivity is cross-modular
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   during the trip but afterwards as well
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   and you're saying that that correlates very strongly
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   with the strength of the therapeutic outcome for depression.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   I mean the logical extension of that
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   is that extreme modularity of brain function
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   is depressive in some way.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Now we don't want to go too far
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   but what does that mean that increasing cross-talk
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   between different modules of the brain
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   is so strongly correlated with a positive therapeutic outcome?
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   We don't know other than that as a relationship.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   I mean this is the thing
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   and we need to be a little careful
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   not to run with it too far.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   I mean there's some things that it suggests
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I think it suggests a more flexible mode of brain functioning
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   if you're not getting stuck in modules
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   or the modules aren't excessively cut off from each other
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   but you see different things with different presentations
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   if you were to look at cognition
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   sharper cognition is actually associated with more modularity
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   so it's a rule that's a little slippery
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   and we need to be careful with it.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   I just again I'll forgive me for interrupting
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   but I think I have friends who are
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I would say are on the spectrum
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   who are very linear in their thinking
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   and extremely intelligent in the kind of classic sense
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   of being able to ratchet through hard problems
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   to arrive at a solution
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   and then I have friends who are
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   let's just call them what they are
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   on the outside of science
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   that are very expansive
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   they see connections between many different things
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   but sometimes you have to
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   not all of them but you have to catch their ideas
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   with a butterfly net and oftentimes
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   what they're saying doesn't
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   sometimes just doesn't make any sense.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Now they also produce incredible creative works
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   but to have a conversation with them
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   is anything but a linear experience.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   They're not random thought generators
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   but there's a non-linearity or randomness
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   or processing that's distinct from these other folks
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   that I'm describing as on the spectrum
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   and of course it's a spectrum
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   there's a whole range in between.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   It sounds to me like there is some therapeutic value
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   to being able to move along this continuum
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   from the more linear to the non-linear.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Is that correct?
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   - Yeah it's resonating what you're saying
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   it's speaking to my intuition
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   that you could be very passy
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   passing things up, chopping things up
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   like an analytical scientist.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   - A splitter. - Like I'm doing.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   - A splitter as we say in science
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   you're either a lumper or a splitter.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   - Or the way I'm being very particular
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   about when to call something psychedelic
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   that kind of passy analytical way
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   of thinking you might associate
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   with a more modular system.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Whereas the system that's more globally
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   interconnected and open
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   might be more flexible and creative
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   and divergent in the associations and so on.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   So yes that's speaking to my intuition
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   to how you're describing it.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   And I imagine if you take severe psychopathology
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   severe mental illness like a depression
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   I've always thought that there's something intuitive
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   about the term itself
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   like a depression in a landscape.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   You know which is a whole.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   - Physical depression. - A physical depression
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   that it's easy to fall into
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   and if you do it's hard to get out of.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   - So almost if I understand what you're saying
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   correctly almost like getting stuck
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   at one location on this continuum
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   because most people don't reside
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   at one extreme or the other full time
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   and kind of migrate back and forth
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   between expansive states and more linear states.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   - Like you do with low mood.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   If you're healthy and inverted commas
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   you can feel your low mood, your disappointment
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   but you can spring back.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   But someone with--
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   - You know you can spring back.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   Whereas the suicidal depressive person
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   or a suicidally depressed person
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   somehow at least in my understanding
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   there's something about the extreme depressive states
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   and extreme anxiety states,
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   something my laboratory's a bit more familiar with anxiety,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   which alters the perception of time
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   such that people feel like that negative state
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   is going to go on forever
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   or that if it goes away
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   that it's going to return at random.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   Kind of a vulnerability to the time domain.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   - Yeah, yeah that's it.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   And it's so tragic but that cognitive bias
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   in depression that everything's hopeless
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Yeah so if you were to get stuck in that rut
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   and have that bias then you're cut off
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   from other things, other sensory modalities
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   or modules, you know, cut off from the world,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   cut off from other people, stuck in your inner rut.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   And so yes, I think we're sharing this intuition
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   that a decrease in modularity
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   or an opening up of the system, the brain
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   could relate to an opening up of the mind
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   that is kind of enduring
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   after the psychedelic dosing session.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   And yeah, and the third replication
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   was to see in healthies an improvement in well-being
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   because they're healthy, we don't look at depression.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   - So these are people that are healthy
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   walking into the trial. - Yeah.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   - Take psilocybin twice.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   - Well, actually they do
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   but the first dose is one milligram
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   which they don't feel, it's a placebo dose.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   - What a quote, micro dose.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   - Yeah, we stick EG on their heads
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   to measure their brain waves.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   During each dose and one milligram you see no change.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   So we, I think--
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   - No, I'm just kidding.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   I've been working against the micro doses.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   I've always just been a little bit skeptical
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   based on my conversations with the scientists
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   actually doing the work with psychedelics.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   It seems like the answer keeps coming back.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   Do one or two, maybe three macro doses
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   in a controlled safe setting.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   - Well, that's compelling.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   The evidence for that is compelling
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   and that's what's making all the difference right now
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   and micro-dosing is just appealing.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   But again, science isn't about what we want to believe.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   It's about what's actually coming through
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   and what seems to hold up to testing.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   - I'd like to just take a brief break
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium and potassium,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   the so-called electrolytes and no sugar.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   also called neurons.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   of 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   and after physical training as well,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   especially if I've been sweating a lot
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   you can go to drink element, that's lmnt.com/huberman
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Again, that's drink element lmnt.com/huberman.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   - Would you say that's right,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   the one or two or three sessions
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   and how far apart are those typically spaced in time?
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   - Yeah, typically one, two, three weeks across the sites
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   is the way people are doing
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   the psychedelic therapy dicing sessions.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Two sessions, Hopkins, Imperial, NYU,
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   that's been a kind of default too.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   We actually use three in a current anorexia trial,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   the cybin therapy for anorexia.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   Two patients left to see after 19
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   who've gone through the trial,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   very exciting results there.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   - You're seeing alleviation
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   of the obsessive thought about food
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   and a willingness to consume healthier amounts of food.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   - Yeah, even improved weight at the long follow-up.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   - So critical.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   We did an episode on eating disorders
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   and I learned that anorexia nervosa
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   which by the way, folks,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   the rates of are not increasing.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   It's been pretty stable through time
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   despite what's said about social media and et cetera.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   But anorexia nervosa being the most deadly
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   of all psychiatric illnesses,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   which is a big statement because manic depression,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   so-called bipolar depression
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   has a 20 to 30 times the typical suicide rate.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   Basically many anorexic,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   people with anorexia I think is how it's now,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   is what one says, not anorexics,
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   but people with anorexia often die.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Many of them die.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   - Yeah, so tragic.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   So often young people as well
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   and similarly with suicide in terms of premature death.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   So the tragedy with psychiatry is so strong
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   and so it's so rewarding to be doing that trial
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   and to be seeing good results.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   I have to check myself a little bit
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   that I am reporting on it in this really promissory way
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   and the trial isn't yet publicly released and published
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   so it's still ongoing as well.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   - But that was three sessions.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   - It is three sessions and I can't say what the dosage is
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   because we still have, there is a blinding component
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   but there are three dosing sessions
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   and let's see now, I think they're two weeks apart.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   And we do the follow-up, yes.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   - I'd like to close out this description
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   of the journey and the trip by extending past the day
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   when people actually take the drug
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   into this what I've heard described
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   as the integration phase.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   You have to reintegrate, right?
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   All this increased connectivity during the session,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   hallucinations, insights, anxiety, letting go,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   maybe revelation, maybe epiphany, okay, great.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   At what point is that consolidated?
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Meaning are these patients or subjects
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   in studies having daily conversation with their therapist?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Are they journaling every day?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   And I want to keep in mind that most people
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   are not going to be part of a clinical trial
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   and of course here we're not suggesting
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   what people do or not do but let's just put it this way.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   How are people to use psychedelics?
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   What is the way that people can maximize
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   on the neuroplasticity and the brain changes
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   in a positive way in the days and weeks afterwards?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   In other words, how long does this
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   so-called integration last?
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   And how far can we take this?
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   I could imagine that how often one chooses
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   to think about the insights could also have an impact.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Because clearly people went to raves,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   clearly people did psychedelics in the 60s.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   We don't know if, clearly people do psychedelics now,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   but we don't have data on those people.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   You have access to the understanding
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   of how they're spending their time
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   and the therapeutic outcomes,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   which we haven't gotten to the numbers yet,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   but again are incredibly impressive.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   You know, in upwards of, as I understand it,
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   60% or more people getting relief from depression.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   - Yeah, 70, yeah.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   - 70%, incredible, especially when compared
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   to the typical antidepressant treatments and so on.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   So what is this business of integration?
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   How is it done properly?
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   - Yeah, yeah, gosh.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   Well, how long does it last as well?
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   A lifetime, you know, life is a journey.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   Like a trip is a journey.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   And there's always work to do.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   You know, as Jack Kornfield says
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   after the ecstasy, the laundry.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   - I love that.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   - Yeah, there'll be other good ones as well.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   I forget them.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   But yeah, so the work's ongoing.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   Yeah, but this gives you a foot up.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   It enables people to do the work more easily.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   And that's true of the classic psychedelics.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   It's also true, very true of MDMA therapy
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   It's really giving you a leg up,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   making it easier to do very, very difficult work,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   going back to a trauma, trying to digest it,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   process it, integrate it.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   So it's such an essential component
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   of the treatment model.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   But one has to be realistic as well.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   You know, by saying, oh, integration lasts a lifetime,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   well, people delivering a service
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   can't be there for a lifetime.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   So what's the answer?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   And people are wrestling with that issue right now.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   And I think one of the solutions might be
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   that it's in a sense on you to a point, you know.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   The therapeutic team can treat you to a point
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   and then it becomes what you might call practice
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   in a similar way that meditation is a practice.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   It's something that you have to keep up.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   And if it's something that you have to keep up,
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   and if it slips, then things could slip.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   And that's the way it is.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   Or you have another psychedelic treatment, you know.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   So people have even used this term of practice
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   in relation to psychedelics,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   where there's a psychedelic practice,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   like there's a meditation practice.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   But I'm using meditation intentionally here
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   because they actually think that meditation
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   and they think that meditative practice,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   spiritual practice, elements of spiritual practice
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   could be a very important complement
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   to psychedelic therapy.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   And I think it's probably doing something similar
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   in terms of promoting an ability to sit with.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   A former colleague of mine said it quite well
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   in relation to psychedelic therapy
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   versus chronic pharmacotherapy,
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   or like SSRIs being on them all the time.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   So psychedelic therapy allows you to sit with
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   rather than sit on.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   And I thought that's quite good.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Yeah, so you know, the meditation, the mindfulness,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   the ability to, yes, be presence-centered,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   but also presence-centered and accepting.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   So if things come up, you can watch and process
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   and then let go.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   That holy grail of mindfulness.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   Awareness without reactivity.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   I grew up in the Bay Area
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   and you'd hear this language, right?
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   And I'm not being disparaging of this.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   I have friends that are on the board of Esalen
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   and work down there, you know,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   and I've gone there and it's, you know,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   and yet you hear these terms, right?
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   Be responsive, not reactive,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   which to a neuroscientist is like greats on me,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   which just means I have issues.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   But, and surely I do.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   But, you know, it's like, what does that mean, right?
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   It's sort of saying like, oh, to be the observer
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   but not be drawn into the experience.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   You know, and again,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   I don't want to be overly reductionist,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   but what I find so compelling about the emerging data,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   because it really is data on psychedelics
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   as treatments for depression and trauma,
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   namely psilocybin and MDMA,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   is that it really seems to allow people this space
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   that is so commonly thrown around, you know,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   giving space between stimulus and reaction.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   I mean, Victor Frankl talked about this,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   but you know, I've been reading a wonderful book
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   called "The Prince of Medicine"
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   that dates back to the origins of medicine,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   very dense book.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   People have been talking about this stuff
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   and thinking about this stuff for thousands of years.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   Psychedelics seem to give people access
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   to that better version of self,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   which is remarkable.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   What's also remarkable,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   it's perhaps worth pointing out,
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   I've been comfortable having this conversation.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I would have been afraid to lose my job.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   Stanford Magazine this week
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   just published an entire issue about psychedelics
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   with how ketamine works, MDMA, psilocybin,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   with the appropriate cautionary notes in there,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   but clearly times are changing.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   Speaking of which,
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   I know you're doing a trial on first-time use of psychedelics.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   What inspired that and what are you observing?
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   And as you tell us that,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   please give us a few of the key contours.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   What's the dose?
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   How old are these subjects?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   I'm assuming it's men and women.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   Are they suffering from depression or not?
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   What's the landscape of that study?
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   And I realize this is still early days of the study
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   or maybe it's close to completion.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   It's not yet published, however, correct?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   No, it's not published.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   It's not submitted.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   It is completed.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   So this was another one of our COVID studies in a sense,
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   meaning COVID hit and we had to finish the study.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   And it was hard to finish the study because of COVID.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   That was true about psilocybin therapy
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   versus escitalopram, Lexapro trial,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   which is published, New England Journal of Medicine.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   This was 20, that paper, by the way,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   folks will provide a link to in the show note captions,
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   as well as some of Robin's other papers.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   I think the 2022 New England Journal paper
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   is really fabulous given the different dosages
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   and the comparison to essentially what is microdosing
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   and the comparison to escitalopram.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Yeah, that's interesting that you link
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   the way we gave small doses of psilocybin to microdosing.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   We didn't think of it that way.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   We thought it was just a necessary placebo
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   for the big dose, the 25 milligrams.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Yeah, so that we could say to everyone
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   we're giving you psilocybin and not be lying.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Yeah, for those who got escitalopram,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Lexapro for six weeks, they got a very, very low dose.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   But it allowed us to standardize all the psychotherapy and so on.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   But the other study that you're referring to
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   was in healthies, healthy volunteers,
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   middle aged, average age, I think was 40.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   So not your typical student study
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   that is so often the case in psychology research.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   All the undergrads end up volunteering for your study.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   So this is more of an age range and also,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   I think it was an equal proportion of male and female.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   All the staff actually were female,
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   which the staff were very proud of.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   Although it produces its own potential confound, right?
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   To have all one sex of staff.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   Possibly.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   They did a good job in the sense
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   that we saw significant improvements in wellbeing
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   at the end of the trial.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   So let me describe the design.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   It was a repeated measures design
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   meaning people come in, you collect your baseline data
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   and do a brain scan and you give people a placebo.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   We gave people a placebo.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   Actually, let me rewind a little bit.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   Everyone's healthy volunteers, middle aged,
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   never taken a psychedelic in their life.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   None of them.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Entirely fresh, virgin people coming in
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   and the plan is to give them
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   their first ever psychedelic experience.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   So that's what we did in the study.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   But to do it, we have this repeated measures design
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   where they'll first get a placebo.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   And we have the placebo
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   so that we can do all the procedures,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   all the therapy, all the music listening
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   but not give a whopping dose of psilocybin.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   Again, we gave them a placebo dose
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   of psilocybin, one milligram.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   We stick EG headsets on during the experience
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   to record the brain activity from the scalp,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   the oscillating electrical activity
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   and we do the MRI scanning before and after
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   to see deeper into the brain
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   and we can look at the functional connectivity
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   that we were referring to earlier
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   and also properties of brain anatomy
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   which we did in this study.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   So the short story is that all of the changes
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   that we saw both psychologically and neurobiologically
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   were seen with the 25 milligrams.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   It all happened with that big whopping dose.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   And what did we see?
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   Well, we did see significant improvements
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   in psychological well-being.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   We saw what I call the entropic brain effect
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   which is actually formally quite accurate.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   We see an increase in the informational complexity
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   of ongoing brain activity recorded with the EG
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   on the dose of psilocybin.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   The activity becomes more complex.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   It's harder to predict across the brain
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   and it's harder to predict across time.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   It's more informationally rich
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   and that effect correlates as it does very reliably
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   with the magnitude of the subjective effect.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   So the bigger the trip,
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   the bigger the entropic brain effect,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   now pretty well replicated finding.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   But then the MRI seeing deep into the brain
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   was probably our most exciting result
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   where we didn't just see some functional brain activity
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   but we've seen some anatomical brain changes as well.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   And we used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   that looks at the cabling of the brain,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   the white matter tracks.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   And we saw a change in major tracks
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   so we sort of limited our search space
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   to really thick tracks, really thick fibers.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   And the fibers that came through as changing
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   were ones that traveled between the brain
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   and the brain.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   They traveled between the prefrontal cortex
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   and the thalamus and the striatum.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   There were two tracks, two prefrontal tracks
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   that changed and they changed in the direction
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   of a decrease in axial diffusivity
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   which could be interpreted as tract integrity
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   where a decrease would be an increase in tract integrity.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   It is something that you see in the developing brain
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   that axial diffusivity decreases
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   as a brain goes from being a baby to being an adult,
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   axial diffusivity goes down.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   And then in aging and pathologies of aging,
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   axial diffusivity goes up.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   - So this is in the opposite direction
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   of the results you talked about earlier
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   in terms of brain connectivity
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   of a sort of increased communication across areas.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   If I understand correctly,
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong by the way,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   that this decrease in axial diffusivity
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   translates to a higher fidelity of communication
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   between the prefrontal cortex
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   and the thalamus and striatum as opposed to less.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   And your description of this is somewhat
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   like the transition from babyhood
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   and childhood to adulthood speaks to the same
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   where we know that there's a massive culling
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   of connections as opposed to growth of connections.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   So in other words, as we get older,
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   we get better at doing certain things
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   and less good at doing potentially most everything else.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   Is that right?
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   - Ish, because the change was anatomical
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   and not functional.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   So the other stuff is really measuring
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   communication in the brain by looking
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   at how the activity fluctuates across time
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   and whether those fluctuations in activity
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   are synchronous between regions.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   And when we say they are,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   we say they're functionally connected
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   and we infer that they're talking to each other
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   'cause they go up and down in synchrony.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   But when it comes to the anatomy,
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   we're talking about the just static material stuff.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   And so we're seeing the fibers
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   and a property of the fibers change.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   At least that's what we think.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   And recently we had an independent person
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   reanalyze the data 'cause one of those things,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   incredible finding requires credible evidence,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   really strong evidence.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   And I would say the evidence at the moment
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   is one study, so we need to be cautious on that.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   But we did reanalyze it and use this correction procedure,
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   free water correction, to be more sure
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   that it was a change in the actual microstructure
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   rather than something to do
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   with the extracellular space,
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   the water surrounding the fibers.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   And it came through.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   In fact, the change was strengthened
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   by doing this correction step.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   - So these are, this is neuroplasticity
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   as the consequence of one first-time session
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   with 25 milligrams of psilocybin.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   - Yeah, yeah, so we're excited.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   - Understandably so.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   - And the two different,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   you know, the second analyst coming in
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   wasn't sure she believed it
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   and then she, you know, thought this correction technique
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   might kind of kill the result
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   and then it came through and she's like,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   "Okay, now I'm excited too."
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   So we'll see, we don't know what it means.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]   What does it mean functionally, we don't know.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   How did the people change?
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   Well, psychologically, as I said, well-being improved.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   We did look at their cognition
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   and we used a cognitive flexibility paradigm
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   that looks at people's ability to notice a rule change
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   and then flexibly adapt their behavior
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   based on noticing this rule change
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   and people improved after the 25 milligrams
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   and didn't significantly improve after the placebo dose.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   There weren't correlations with the DTI change,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   the cabling change and these psychological outcomes
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   but, you know, with these studies in smaller sample sizes,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   you don't always see those correlations come through.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   So it's something we don't know.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   We don't know what it means
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   but it's a change in brain anatomy
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   that's in the opposite direction
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   to what you see in an aging brain
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   or with pathology of aging
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000]   and it's what you see in a healthy brain
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   as it goes from, you know,
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   normal neurodevelopment into adulthood.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   - Very, very exciting and intriguing
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   and I appreciate that you highlighted
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   that it's just one study,
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   although from everything you've said,
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   it sounds like it's been done with immense rigor
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   so we will eagerly await the publication of that study
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   and so we can peruse all the data
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   and the subsequent studies.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   I want to hear a bit about the study
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   that you have been carrying out
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   on the use of psilocybin
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   I'm intrigued by fibromyalgia
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   because I have a good friend
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   who also, I won't reveal who it is
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   and no, it's not me.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   This isn't the I have a friend thing
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   who also is a scientist
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   in a very high position
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   in the National Institutes of Health
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   who quietly has expressed to me
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   that they are incredibly frustrated
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   with the fact that the standard medical community
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   has largely ignored fibromyalgia
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   and that for many years,
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   it was kind of lumped with things
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000]   like chronic fatigue syndrome
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   and other so-called, again, so-called,
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000]   I'm not saying this,
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   but people often refer to these as,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   oh, it's psychosomatic, that's all in your head,
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   that's a ridiculous statement to hear
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   because it's all in your head,
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   your brain is in your head.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   After all, your physiology
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   and your psychology
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   are influencing each other, of course,
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   and the world is starting to appreciate that more.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   But first of all,
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   maybe you could tell people
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   what fibromyalgia is,
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000]   what inspired you to do a study
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   on fibromyalgia using psilocybin of all things
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   because that's surprising to me
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   and if you are allowed to
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   or if you have access to the data
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   in mind, share with us a little bit
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   about what you're discovering
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   in that study.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   - Sure, yeah, happy to.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   So again, it's psilocybin therapy
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   and the population is fibromyalgia syndrome
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   so this is people presenting
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   with a generalized chronic pain.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000]   So unlike some other pain disorders
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   where the pain is focused,
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   you can say it's my lower back
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   which is very common,
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   chronic lower back pain.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   This is more generalized
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   and for that reason,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   it's hard to sort of know what it is
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   and that's why it's been
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   a controversial space in medicine
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   and it's been, yeah,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   it's had that charge thrown at it
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   that maybe it's psychosomatic
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   and just to your point,
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   is anything ever independent
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   of the mind anyway?
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   But this is actually a fascinating space
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   for how subjective experience,
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   the lived experience
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   of the mind can influence the body
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   because there's some really interesting literature
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   around the etiology,
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   like how the pain has come about.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   In a sense, like what caused the pain?
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   What's the story there?
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   And ahead of the trial,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   I would say to my colleagues,
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   let's just be careful
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   because there is some fascinating literature
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   around things like a background of trauma
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   and how that can relate to issues
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   related to inflammation
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000]   and how that can express into things
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   like fibromyalgia syndrome.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000]   I just said be very careful there
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   because if you go in with an assumption
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   that there's some buried trauma, for example,
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   then there's that whole other side of psychoanalysis
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   that massively tripped it up
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   around false memory and so on
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   so please don't hold prior assumptions
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000]   that you're going to uncover buried trauma in every case.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   Now, the team have treated, I think, eight people
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   and it is going very well.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000]   Again, I just want to be careful
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   with how I describe it to manage expectations
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   and not get too carried away.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   But I check in with the team every week
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   and they're still based in London doing the work.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   And it's remarkable what I hear
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   about the profound experiences
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   that people have under the drug.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   In this study, we only give one dose.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   It's a very mechanistic study.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   We actually have the EEG cap on in the sessions
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   like in the healthy volunteer study
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   but this time now taking it into a clinical population.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   - So they're in the eye, they are wearing an eye mask
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   under the influence of 25 milligrams of psilocybin.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   Most of them probably have not done psilocybin before
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   so it's a little bit like the first time study in some sense.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000]   They have fibromyalgia that's debilitating in some way.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   They don't want it, obviously.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000]   And during the session,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   are they thinking about their pain?
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   Are they being told to think about their pain?
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   - They're not being told to think about the pain.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   In fact, as I understand it,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   while there is a therapeutic model
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   around acceptance of the pain,
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   it isn't, unlike some of the PTSD work,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   you aren't encouraging them to focus on the index trauma
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   and then work through it and try and digest it.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]   We don't do that with the pain.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000]   So the pain's there,
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000]   but there isn't an invitation to focus on it.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   And that's probably one of the differences
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   with classic psychedelic therapy versus MDMA therapy.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000]   Arguably MDMA therapy is more like,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   it's a bit closer to traditional talk therapy
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]   where there is more dialogue.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   People are able to talk on MDMA.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   - In the MDMA trials,
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   do you know whether or not they used eye masks?
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   Or because this seems to be an important distinction
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   between as you described the therapeutic trip
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   versus the trip that one does,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   going into the woods and taking psilocybin in the woods
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   or at a party or while staring at a poster or a leaf.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   Again, I'm not trying to trivialize those experiences.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   I mean, obviously they can be profound, so I'm told.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000]   But the MDMA trials seem to involve, as you said,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   more directed dialogue
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   and sometimes even kind of empathic connection
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   between people by they're actually looking at one another.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   The eyes and eye contact being such a key part
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   of the human social cognitive connective networks.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   So do you know if they put eye masks on people
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   during the therapy?
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   - I'm pretty sure that they have the eye masks there.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   - Because a lot of the MDMA work,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   and I was part of an MDMA trial,
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   was, as I understand, geared toward developing,
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   because it's an empathogen, empathy toward the self.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   - I'm pretty sure they have the eye masks there,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   but they probably, and it's a great question
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   because you could formally test this,
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   they probably don't use them as much.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   The thing is with the classic psychedelics,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   you're looking at your guides, your facilitators,
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   and their faces are melting or whatever.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   - On MDMA, you just might really start to feel
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   more connected to your stuff.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   - Yeah, they might look especially beautiful.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   - Sure, yeah.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   - And yeah, there's that fascinating effect
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   of loving the people that you're with.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000]   And so yeah, I imagine they talk more
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   and use the eye shades less.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   And it is more interpersonal
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   rather than intrapersonal or going inside.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   They do use a fascinating terminology
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]   that some people have critiqued,
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   but it's a very interesting phenomenon,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   and it's this notion of the inner healer.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]   They use that language a lot.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]   It's been critiqued 'cause it sounds very suggestive,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   and that's probably one of the vehicles here driving
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   the therapeutic process is suggestion.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   I think we have to be honest about that.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   But so when they go inside, that's another term
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   that we use very much in the classic psychedelic therapy work.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   You go inside, you put the eye shades on,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   and people are encouraged to go inside.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   But when they do that in the MDMA work especially,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   they might be told explicitly and listen to the inner healer
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   in that kind of language.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   So you could see how a cynic or a skeptic could come in
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]   and see that as some kind of suggestive priming or biasing.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   I think they have a point.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   Skeptics often do, but I don't think it's all of the story.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   And just briefly, 'cause it's an interesting point,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   speaking to that point a bit,
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   in our psilocybin therapy versus estetelopram trial,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   we measured pretrial expectancy,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   and we did it for both conditions.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   So what kind of improvement do you expect with the Lexapro,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   the estetelopram at the end of the trial,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]   and what kind of improvement if you go into the psilocybin arm
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000]   and get two big doses of psilocybin,
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   what kind of improvement do you think you'll see in that arm?
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000]   And of course it was a coin flip as to what arm people went into,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   and there was no crossover.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000]   And what we found was that it was true that we had a sample bias,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   so most people had higher expectations,
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000]   on average there were higher expectations for psilocybin
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   and its efficacy or effectiveness versus the SSRI, the Lexapro.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   However, when we looked at the correlation
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   or the predictive relationship between pretrial expectancy and response,
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   we saw that pretrial expectancy for the estetelopram
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.000]   predicted response to estetelopram across virtually every single measure,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   all these different measures of depression and anxiety and wellbeing,
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   and I think none of the scales,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   I'm pretty sure it was none of about 12 or so mental health rating scales,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   was there a relationship between pretrial expectancy,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   even though it was high, it didn't predict,
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   pretrial expectancy didn't predict response to the psilocybin therapy.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   So that was a bit of a smash on the head for the idea
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000]   that classic psychedelic therapy is some kind of placebo response.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]   I think it's so important to address that question
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   because if it doesn't come through as it didn't come through,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   then it opens up even more intrigue about, well, what is it then?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]   If it's not just a placebo response or a super placebo response,
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]   like an amplification of the placebo response,
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000]   then it must be something else and how intriguing it has a direct therapeutic action,
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000]   it must be something and we don't yet know what it is.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   I talked about the residual increase in global connectivity,
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   that's one possibility, but the truth is we're just scratching the surface.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   And yet the therapeutic outcomes are, again, just so marvelously impressive.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000]   I'm curious as to why, well, there aren't that many labs,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   but the laboratories that are focused on classic psychedelics
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000]   for the treatment of depression and now, as you mentioned,
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000]   promising results for anorexia and fibromyalgia as well,
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]   although preliminary, very promising.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000]   Why the lack of attention toward LSD?
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000]   Is it that the LSD trips are just too long?
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]   Is it that they are qualitatively different?
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   Are there any data on non-microdoses of LSD?
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000]   And here I want to be very careful
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   because I learned through my interactions on social media
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   that this term microdose is very misleading
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000]   and in some cases can be dangerously misleading
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]   and as I mentioned earlier, the effective psychedelic dose
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]   or, you know, the effective meaning that can induce a real trip
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000]   with hallucinations, et cetera, of LSD is actually in the microgram range.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]   So some people hear microdose
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.000]   and they think microgram of LSD is a micrograms is a microdose
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   when in fact a macrodose of LSD can be measured in micrograms, right?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   So this is where, you know, in the absence of scientific training,
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   people can really go astray
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.000]   or even in just in the lack of understanding of the metric system
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000]   and since now you're a recent rival to the US.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   Fortunate for us.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000]   Sorry, England's loss is the US's gain
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000]   by Robin's lab move from England to the United States recently.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]   So score one for us.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]   But why isn't there more use of LSD in these trials?
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   I think it probably is the duration of the trip.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   It used to be stigma
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:34.000]   and it was easier to get your psilocybin study through
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000]   because others were, they were getting that through.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   So there was still like Franz Wallenweider in Zurich in Switzerland
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   and then Roland Griffiths coming along
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000]   and doing the psilocybin work at Hopkins.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]   So you could appeal to that precedence
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]   and say well they're doing it over there, you know.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000]   Can we not do it in little England?
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000]   So that's how it worked for us.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000]   We did actually go on and do an LSD study
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000]   once we kind of laid the foundations
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   for doing this kind of work
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]   and it was a brain imaging study.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   It was a really extensive one actually
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000]   where we used both MRI and another modality called MEG,
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000]   sort of super EG in a sense.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   But why didn't we, why didn't that turn our heads to think
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   oh should we not be doing our trials with LSD?
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000]   It does have something to do with the pragmatics.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   Like a study day with psilocybin is long enough.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000]   It's a four to six hour trip.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:43.000]   Yeah and the FDA ask us to have the people in the lab
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   until eight hours post dose,
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000]   which personally I think could be quite excessive,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]   especially if it's a low dose.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000]   You know if you have that in the placebo condition as well
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000]   it becomes impractical.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000]   Yeah scientists are not paid nearly enough to warrant the,
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000]   there's no such thing as overtime
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000]   for the graduate students and postdocs.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000]   Yeah it's often that there's more junior members
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]   that are doing that really hard work.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000]   It was described very well to me by a student
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   a graduate student said to me,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000]   "They really can't afford to pay us by the hour."
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000]   Because we used to work, he was an electrophysiologist
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   so he would run experiments, no joke folks,
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   three to five day experiments,
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000]   sleeping in bouts of two hours here or there
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000]   in a dark room with a bunch of equipment and recording.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000]   So these are long, long,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000]   acute electrophysiological recordings.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000]   So yeah no scientist does it for the money I promise you.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   There's money in pharma, there is not money in personal income,
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   it's not lucrative for the basic scientist.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.000]   So yes LSD is what, anywhere from eight to 15 hours,
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000]   something like that.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]   Yeah 15 would be a little long, you'd be a bit worried
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   if you were still tripping at that time,
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]   maybe with a really big dose.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]   Oops, no just kidding.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000]   But yeah, eight hours plus and dose dependent,
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]   yeah if it's a bigger dose it's a longer experience.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]   But if you're going to dose at say 10am in the morning,
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]   which is more or less how it often goes,
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000]   then at 6pm still feeling the effects
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.000]   and then how long do you wait now to close things out
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]   before they can go home.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   Even with psilocybin you have people still at work
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000]   into the evening and the staff are always there later
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000]   of course because they've got to pack up.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   And yeah, so these are long days and it's just,
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]   it's too much you know.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000]   - That makes sense, practical constraints.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000]   I learned from a recent guest on this podcast
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000]   that we recorded with Dr. Satchin Panda
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000]   who was a colleague of mine when I was down
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   at the Salk Institute, pioneered a lot of the studies
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000]   on so-called intermittent fasting.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000]   That the reason the intermittent, that the eating period
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000]   in these studies in animals and now on humans
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000]   is eight hours, the sort of feeding window
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000]   in these studies is because the graduate student
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   was going to otherwise lose their relationship
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   because their significant other says,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000]   "Listen, you can be in the lab for 12 hours."
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000]   That meant some hours before the experiment,
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]   then eight hours and then some hours afterwards,
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000]   but you can't stay in there longer.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000]   And many people use the eight hour feeding window
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]   as a consequence.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]   So the science has to exist and be carried out
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]   in real world frame.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]   - It does, it does.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000]   - MDMA is a little bit, a little bit shorter, right?
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000]   It's also about four to six hours, correct?
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]   - Yeah, it's kind of similar to psilocybin.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]   Yeah, it is, and actually in the MAPS work,
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]   they redose after a certain point.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   - Or the boost, the booster.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]   - They have a booster, optional booster, yeah.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]   So there is that.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   And now people are thinking, well,
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   even these psilocybin sessions are long and expensive
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000]   and if you have to have two staff members there
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]   all the time, that's expensive.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000]   That's where most of the expense is, is in the staffing.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000]   So can we abridge the experience, make it shorter,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]   and get away with it,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000]   and get similar kind of therapies outcomes.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000]   So there's a lot of interest in that direction.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]   - May I ask about, sorry to interrupt,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]   but I want to make sure I don't forget too,
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000]   ask about combination psilocybin MDMA therapies.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000]   The reason I ask about this is, and here truly not me,
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.000]   but I know people who do self-administered combination
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000]   psilocybin and MDMA.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000]   I think I have this right.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]   I think it's called a hippie flip.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000]   There's another one that involves LSD too.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]   Again, I'm not suggesting people
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   do these kind of drug combinations,
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000]   but the way it was described to me was that the psilocybin,
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000]   because it's so serotonergic sometimes can be not a downer,
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]   but can have a bit of a kind of a murky feel to it,
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]   some real deep introspection sometimes
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000]   in the darker realms of one's psyche, depressive thoughts,
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]   et cetera.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]   Not that it necessarily stays that way throughout the trip,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]   but that the MDMA,
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   because it has a very strongly serotonergic,
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]   but also dopaminergic.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]   I mean, it has an amphetamine component,
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]   cocaine-like in fact.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   If you've ever seen someone in MDMA,
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000]   their pupils are about the size of quarters for a reason.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]   They're in extremely, extreme autonomic arousal
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]   compared to a sedative.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000]   Which by the way, would constrict the pupils.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000]   So they described the use of MDMA
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]   to kind of balance out the kind of affect component of it.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000]   What are your thoughts on combination psilocybin MDMA?
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]   Does this hold any therapeutic potential?
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000]   This is obviously a backyard chemistry
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]   in the sense that people are,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000]   kind of cowboying this stuff on their own,
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   which again, I don't really recommend.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]   I like to see the science go first,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   but I understand this is how it works in the real world.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   Yeah, what are your thoughts on combining compounds?
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]   - Yeah, well, I guess they're cowboying it
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]   in recreational context,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000]   but also underground therapists do work with this combo.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]   - That's what I'm referring to.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]   I'm not talking about people partying with this stuff.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]   I'm talking about, there are thousands now of therapists
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]   that offer psychedelic therapies illegally, really,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]   'cause it's not legal, at least not in the US,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000]   to possess or sell, but that are doing this.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000]   So that's really why I'm asking.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]   - Yeah, and I think there's something to be said
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000]   for one who has to be careful with this as a scientist,
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]   but if they're doing it,
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]   are they using some kind of trial and error?
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]   The same is true, of course,
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.000]   with the longer history of psychedelic plant medicine use.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.000]   By plants, we include the fungi as well,
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   so in the extended sense, plants.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000]   There will have been trial and error there.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]   It might not be as systematic
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000]   as the science we do today,
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]   but maybe there's been a learning process,
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]   and maybe what they do,
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000]   they've come to because they found it works.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000]   So by that principle, I'm interested in that combination
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000]   and whether it does offer some advantages,
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]   maybe in certain patients.
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000]   One of the buzz terms in medicine these days
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000]   is precision medicine, precision medicine
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]   and personalized medicine.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]   So maybe there are certain cases
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000]   where introducing, say, psilocybin after the MDMA
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000]   or the other way around could offer some advantages,
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   and the differences are interesting.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000]   Psilocybin can get you to deep places,
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000]   maybe the kernel of your suffering
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:54.000]   and major life experiences and complexes
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000]   that are causally linked to whatever the pathology
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]   that you're presenting with,
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000]   but it can do it sometimes quite aggressively.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000]   And if it's, say, post-traumatic stress disorder,
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]   it can be overwhelming, and you can fight it,
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]   and really it's that.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000]   The resistance is really challenged,
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]   and they fight back.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000]   The therapeutic breakthrough and the progress
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]   isn't happening because you've agitated
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]   the defense mechanisms.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000]   Whereas what MDMA offers is something,
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]   arguably, more directionally reliable
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]   in terms of the valence.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]   It's more directionally positive,
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]   generally, in MDMA experience.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]   Hard to have a bad time on MDMA.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]   To be quite blunt.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000]   One of the concerns I had with MDMA,
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]   I've never done it recreationally.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]   I have had not and have not ever done it recreationally.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]   But when it was done in this therapeutic setting,
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000]   I realized, because there was music on at the beginning,
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.000]   I actually asked them to turn it off
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]   because I realized that the music
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000]   was becoming such an attractor to my attention
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]   that I suddenly was starting to think about music
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]   and my love of music, which was not the focus
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000]   of the session that I was there for.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]   And I'm glad that they did turn the music off
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]   because the moment they did,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]   I was able to drop in within the IMS
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000]   inward and address some certain issues
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000]   that at least to me felt key and productive.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000]   So that seems to be the kind of hazard with MDMA
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.000]   is that it's such an empathogen
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000]   that one could start to,
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000]   you could go down any number of different rabbit holes.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000]   - Yeah, yeah, but it's also,
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]   it's a strength because you,
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000]   well, you know, the classics like psilocybin
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]   can take you there very reliably
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]   but maybe a bit aggressively.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000]   MDMA makes it easier to go there
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]   and that's its strength
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   and that's why that marriage of MDMA therapy
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.000]   for PTSD in particular is a good combo.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]   It works because you are gonna go there.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000]   In a sense, you have to really make the therapeutic progress.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]   You're gonna have to go back there
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000]   but we're gonna set it up so that you can go back there
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000]   and feel safer and more trusting
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000]   and be able to go back there
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000]   whereas you've never otherwise been able
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000]   to go back there without dissociating
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]   or having horrible flashbacks and so on.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]   So that's the strength that it offers.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]   I guess the limitation would be
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]   that maybe it doesn't take you as deep
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   as the classic psychedelics
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000]   and I tend to think, I'm biased on this one,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]   that there's a kind of honesty to the classics
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000]   in that it is hell as well as heaven.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]   And that's the psyche.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]   It isn't all roses.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000]   - I really appreciate that you bring that up
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]   because I think that there's such a fear
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000]   of so-called bad trips.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000]   There's such a fear in non-psychotic states
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000]   to avoid the painful
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000]   and everything we know from trauma
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]   and the treatment of trauma
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]   and we've had several guests on here.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000]   I have a close, close colleague at Stanford,
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000]   Dr. David Spiegel, our associate chair of psychiatry,
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]   he's a clinical hypnotist, amazing,
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]   amazing human being and scientist and clinician
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000]   has really just embedded this in my mind
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]   that the only way to deal with trauma
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]   is to get right up next to that trauma
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000]   to the point where some relief is experienced.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]   There is no other real way.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]   And so I really appreciate that you're saying
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]   that the classic psychedelics may offer
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000]   with a very strong nudge perhaps,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000]   the opportunity to get into the uncomfortable
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000]   in a way that MDMA or some non-classical psychedelics
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]   perhaps do not.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]   We were talking about timeframes
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000]   or duration of trips and these different compounds
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   and how they differ and how they're similar.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000]   I'd love for you to educate me on DMT
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]   and some of the work that you're doing with DMT.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000]   My understanding is that it's a very brief trip, minutes,
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000]   people I know who have done this, again, therapeutically.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000]   Actually, I'll just point to one very exciting,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.000]   I think, group and initiative,
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]   which is the Veteran Solutions Initiative,
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000]   which is a group, this is carried out in Mexico,
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]   but in conjunction with laboratories at Stanford
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   and elsewhere who are evaluating the neural changes.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000]   And this involves Ibogaine, which is Iboga,
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]   which is a very long duration psychedelic,
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000]   22 hours or more, followed by a,
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]   I think, one or two doses of DMT.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]   This is for veterans to deal with any number of issues.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]   Appears to be working with great success
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]   and I've spoken to several people who've gone through this
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]   and the way that they described DMT,
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]   almost across the board, was quote,
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000]   here I'm just pulling quotes, right? Anecdota.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]   The most profound experience of my entire life,
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]   even greater than the birth of my children,
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.000]   quote, like being attached to the shockwave of an atom bomb,
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000]   quote, there's no way I would do another dose
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   because the first one was so unbelievable.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]   Interesting, by the way.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]   I think most of us, including me, would think,
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]   why wouldn't you want to do it again then?
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   But this idea that that was just beyond anything.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]   So these are significant, excuse me,
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]   these are significant statements
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]   coming from individuals who have existed
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000]   at the extremes of human experience to begin with, right?
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]   These are so-called tier one operators
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000]   within the special operations who exit
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]   and may or may not have trauma,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000]   but DMT sounds like a big deal.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000]   Short duration, really big deal.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000]   What do we know about its chemistry?
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000]   What do we know about how it's impacting brain networks
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000]   and what in the world is going on
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]   that people are describing it as
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.000]   the ways I just mentioned a few moments ago?
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000]   Yeah, it's a rocket ship.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000]   If the psalocybin is like a ship leaving port,
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:19.000]   then yeah, this is a rocket ship into craziness.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000]   Is it serotonin 2A?
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]   It is, yeah.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]   So it is a classic psychedelic.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000]   It's a direct agonist, a direct stimulator
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000]   of the serotonin 2A receptor.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000]   It's an order of magnitude less potent
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000]   than psalocybin, but potency is a funny thing
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000]   because it's dose dependent.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000]   So that doesn't mean that the experience with DMT
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000]   is less than that of psalocybin.
[01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000]   It's just that you give more of the drug.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000]   But it has, that's matched by its stickiness
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   for the serotonin 2A receptor,
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000]   which is this kind of golden rule in psychedelic sciences
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]   that it was discovered in the mid 1980s,
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000]   this tight relationship between the affinity
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   and the stickiness or the binding potential
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.000]   of a psychedelic for the 2A receptor in particular,
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000]   serotonin 2A, and its potency.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000]   And the stickier the drug, the more potent.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   So LSD really sticky, very, very potent.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000]   You only need those tiny microgram doses.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.000]   So DMT by its affinity is a little less potent,
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000]   but by its effects when you give a standard dose,
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.000]   it's just wild.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]   And DMT, because there's another compound
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000]   called 5-methoxy DMT, which is a bit different
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000]   pharmacologically and subjectively.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000]   Similar in terms of its kinetics.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000]   It's another rocket ship.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.000]   Both compounds in the wild, so to speak,
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.000]   are smoked often, DMT and 5-MeO.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000]   They're keeping both actually now.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000]   There are vape pens that have been developed
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000]   for people to administer this,
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.000]   but more traditionally it's been a smoking thing.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000]   This is clinically, not recreationally, or both?
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000]   Both now, I mean, you know,
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000]   underground practitioners are using the vape pens.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000]   They like them because people titrate the dosage.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   They get a feel for what it is to be going into this state
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]   that they feel they can let go and go into it.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000]   And actually I think some of the veterans' work
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:39.000]   might be giving 5-MeO after the eye began.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000]   Phenomenologically, if there's a difference
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]   between DMT and 5-MeO, people might put it on
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000]   5-MeO being more of a reliable ego dissolution experience,
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000]   less visual, and more kind of all-round immersion
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000]   in the greater whole loss of self-identity
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000]   and just immersion in everything.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000]   Yeah, maybe we could just talk about
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]   ego dissolution for a second,
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000]   because it's such a sticky, interesting idea.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000]   I can take a step back as a neuroscientist
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000]   and say, okay, ego dissolution,
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000]   this idea that from a very early age
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000]   we have a concept of self,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]   and that I wake up every morning
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000]   and I know I'm me and not somebody else,
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000]   and presumably you do the same,
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000]   and most people do the same, I would hope,
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000]   and that there are objects in the world
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000]   and people in the world beyond us.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]   But every time I hear about ego dissolution,
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000]   it sounds like it's kind of a temporary
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.000]   elimination of the idea that things start and stop
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000]   between us and everything else,
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000]   almost like in a kind of a,
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000]   here I'm not trying to sound philosophical or metaphysical,
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000]   but there's sort of the molecular continuity
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000]   of life, right?
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   We're all just little bits.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000]   - Which is true. - Which is true, right?
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000]   Not a functional way to go through the day, right?
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]   Because you want to make a cup of coffee,
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]   you don't really want to get lost in that
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]   if your goal is to make a cup of coffee.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000]   But what is the power of ego dissolution?
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:21.000]   Is it the idea that we belong?
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000]   Is it a sense of meaning?
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000]   Is it the sense that we're not as important as we think,
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000]   which of course could be a wonderfully useful
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000]   way to go through life,
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]   to think that we're not as,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]   like we are vitally important,
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000]   but we're not the only thing, right?
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]   Because I do believe connection is vital,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000]   as most people do.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]   What is ego dissolution,
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.000]   and why would this serotonin 2A activation cause that?
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]   That's remarkable.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]   - Yeah, great questions.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000]   You alluded to it with the start-stop, I think,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   because you could define it by boundaries,
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000]   in a sense, what isn't me is as valid here
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   as a developing sense of what is me
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]   that a child develops at whatever age.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000]   And so a major characteristic
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000]   of ego dissolution experience, rather than just a negative,
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000]   a thing going away, my sense of self going away,
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000]   is the positive, oh, now I feel interconnected
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]   with other people and the world at large,
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000]   and I realize that there is that molecular continuity,
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]   and actually that's a ground truth.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000]   And oh, maybe the ego thing is somewhat illusory,
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   or at least a construction of my mind.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]   - And indeed it is, right?
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000]   - Yes, yeah, I mean, there's no transcendentalism about that.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]   It's just like logic.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000]   - I think about it a little bit like family.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]   I mean, we all know what immediate family is,
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000]   but sort of like, forgive me for interrupting myself,
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]   I do it all the time anyway,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000]   when I teach neuroanatomy,
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000]   some clever student always figures out,
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]   okay, well, that's connected to that and that's connected,
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]   but ultimately everything in the brain
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]   is connected to everything else.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]   There's just no way around that.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000]   That's a true statement.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]   And so you really just have to decide
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000]   where you draw the boundaries between nuclei.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]   Where are the modules?
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]   What are the modules?
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000]   You could say the brain is just one big macro module,
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000]   and then you also want to include the body.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]   And now, fortunately,
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000]   people are starting to embrace this idea
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]   that it's not mind-body, it's both,
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000]   because the nervous system extends through both, of course.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.000]   So the same could be said of family.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]   Like we're related, right?
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]   Not just by virtue of the fact that we're human beings.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000]   We have genealogical charts.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000]   We would find a convergence at some point.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000]   And of course, this becomes a bit of a game,
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]   but then one realizes that where you draw the boundaries
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000]   and if you draw them at brother, sister, parents,
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000]   biological parents, et cetera, that's a game too.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000]   And so it is just a construct.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000]   Yeah, I mean, it is a fun game.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000]   Where do you draw the line and when to pass
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]   and when to collapse?
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000]   It's also a classic consideration in science, when to pass.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]   The lumber versus the splitter.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000]   There you go, it's brilliant.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]   Yeah, but you asked this question like,
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000]   well, why do psychedelics do it?
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]   And there we think psychedelics do it
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]   because the target receptors,
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000]   at least classic psychedelics do it,
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000]   and that's important to stress.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000]   So MDMA doesn't really do it in the same way.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000]   It might soften the ego a bit,
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]   but yeah, that's debatable.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000]   My experience with MDMA
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000]   is that it's such a strong in pathogen
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.000]   and that it can cause empathy for others.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000]   Certainly you could imagine situations
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000]   where one in MDMA journey and afterwards says,
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000]   "Oh, my oppressors are the people that harmed me."
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000]   And here I'm not referring to my experience,
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]   but they did the best with what they have.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000]   Actually have empathy for them, forgiveness,
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000]   but also for oneself, that there's an empathy for self.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000]   I know I said this earlier,
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000]   that is very hard for most people to access.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000]   Perhaps it's not the narcissists out there listening.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]   They'll be like, "Of course, empathy for self."
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]   But everyone else, I think,
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000]   all the other healthy people
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000]   or the healthy people other than narcissists
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000]   and not picking on narcissists,
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]   I have to imagine they suffer too.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]   In fact, I think that's the root of their narcissism.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000]   Empathy for self is not something
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]   that comes reflexively for most people.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000]   And here I'm not talking about self-love or self-respect,
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000]   but this notion of being able to see the self
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   as not just deserving of love and care,
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000]   but actually holding that in place
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000]   while in confrontation with something challenging
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000]   in a way that allows more, not less access
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]   to adaptive responses to that challenge.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000]   I think that's the way I kind of conceptualize it.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000]   But I mean, drugs offer a great,
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000]   they offer great, they are great scientific tools
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000]   for tackling this question.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000]   What is ego dissolution and why do drugs modulate it
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]   and what does that tell you about the brain?
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]   Because other drugs like cocaine
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000]   releasing more of a different neurotransmitter,
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000]   dopamine, more than serotonin,
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000]   the opposite is the case with MDMA,
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   is more of an ego inflator, right?
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000]   So people become hyperlinear,
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000]   hyperlinked to their own desires and wishes,
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000]   and future outcomes become an obsession.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000]   It's the stuff of kind of American psycho
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000]   and the kind of cliches and stereotypes
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000]   of the '80s cocaine culture.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000]   We did a study once actually looking
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000]   at dose-dependent relationship with ego inflation
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000]   on one axis and ego dissolution on the other
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000]   and saw that it just massively passed or differentiated
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000]   between cocaine and the psychedelics.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]   It's quite a neat study.
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000]   - So cocaine makes people's egos super inflated.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000]   - Yeah, and doesn't touch dissolution
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000]   and the opposite is the case with psychedelics.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000]   - Is there any neuroimaging to explain
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000]   how cocaine does that?
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000]   - That would be a great study, yeah.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]   Great idea. - We should do that.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000]   I have a sabbatical coming up.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000]   I've got 12 months of sabbatical coming up
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000]   and I'm gonna show up in your lab.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]   - Yeah, that's a really good one.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000]   If it's right to finish the thread
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000]   on why psychedelics and ego dissolution,
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.000]   we do know some things or we have some hypotheses
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000]   and it's that the target receptors,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000]   the serotonin 2A receptors that classic psychedelics hit
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]   are heavily expressed in what these days
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000]   I like to call recent brain
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]   because evolutionarily it's recent brain.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000]   It's cortex that humans have more than any other species.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000]   If you look at a mapping of cortical expansion
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000]   from say macaque or chimp to human,
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000]   it's the very same map that you'll find the 2A receptors in.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000]   So that's the target.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000]   And it's just easy to think that,
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000]   oh well that could be the egoic brain, you know,
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000]   and the classic psychedelics come in,
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000]   they kind of, they scramble up the activity.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]   That's the entropic brain action.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000]   And in terms of the start, stop, the boundaries,
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000]   that entropic action sort of spreads out the system.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000]   It doesn't shut it off.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000]   It sort of spreads it out, you know.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000]   - Dissolution.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000]   - Yeah, and you were talking about the head space as well.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000]   So that fits.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000]   If it's more capacious, it sort of fits.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000]   - The big qualifier with psychedelic therapy
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.000]   that people rightly bring up is it doesn't last, you know.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]   That's the paradox of it.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]   The paradox of ego dissolution.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000]   The ego might go away during the trip
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000]   and you have these profound insights
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]   about the molecular continuity
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000]   and how we're all one and interconnected.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000]   And then you come down and however long later,
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000]   you know, the ego comes back, but maybe with a vengeance.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000]   And sadly, you know, things can go awry
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]   when people haven't done the work,
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000]   perhaps haven't done the integration work
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]   and maybe ego defenses come back and, you know,
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000]   and it's not a pretty picture.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000]   - How often do you see that in the trials that you do?
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000]   What percentage of people coming through,
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000]   do you think end up with worse than they were
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000]   before the trial?
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000]   - It's very rare in the trials that we've done.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.000]   Yeah, but you see defenses come back.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000]   So you do see people relapse.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000]   That's more, you know, if you're pushing out
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000]   to like three months plus
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]   in something like treatment-resistant depression,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]   that's more the rule than the exception, sadly.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000]   People relapse.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000]   So if your histories are, you know,
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000]   histories of chronic depression,
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000]   then while you might give them a window of wellness,
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000]   sadly, it doesn't last.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000]   That's not to say that it doesn't ever last.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]   It does.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]   And we have people who were in our first
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000]   treatment-resistant depression trial who are well,
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000]   to my knowledge, today, back at work,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000]   doing fantastically well.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000]   But sadly, the majority have relapsed, to my knowledge.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000]   - And need to do more psychedelic journeys.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000]   - Well, they can't because it's illegal.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000]   That's been the really difficult situation
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]   that we've been up against is that we do a trial
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]   where all of a sudden this Schedule 1 drug
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000]   becomes a medicine in the trial,
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]   or at least an experimental medicine.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.000]   We give the treatment, it works fantastically well,
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.000]   gives people a remission that they've never really had
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000]   for however long, and then the trial ends
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]   and they're denied that treatment.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]   And worse still, if they were to have that treatment,
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000]   they would be committing a crime.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]   It's sort of a sick joke in a way,
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000]   but that's the situation that we've been in.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000]   - That's a perfect segue for what I want to talk about now,
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.000]   which is what is the current state of legality
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000]   or the progression towards legality?
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000]   I'd also like to touch on the role of,
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000]   let's just say, incoming big pharma.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000]   There are a lot of startup companies now
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000]   trying to capitalize on these discoveries
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000]   that you and others have made.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000]   The landscape out there is very unclear to me.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.000]   Maybe I'll just call out some silos as I see them,
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000]   and maybe we can draw some bridges between them
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]   if they exist.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000]   At the ground level, not the grassroots,
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.000]   but at the ground level, I look to laboratories like yours,
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]   Matthew Johnson's, Roland Griffith's,
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000]   some laboratories at Stanford, Nolan Williams,
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.000]   laboratories studying the effects of psychedelics
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000]   in human beings, so not animal models,
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]   in terms of their clinical application
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000]   for the treatment of depression, anorexia,
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000]   I now know fibromyalgia, trauma.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]   Let's lump MDMA in there as well,
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000]   assuming that it all works in an equivalent way
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000]   at the level of kind of where the legislature
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]   is taking things.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:45.000]   So labs using government money, philanthropy, et cetera.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.000]   Then there are the sort of the therapists out there
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000]   that are accessing what we believe are clean sources
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]   of MDMA, psilocybin, LSD to do this.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000]   They are doing it illegally.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000]   This is in the US or other Western European countries
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000]   'cause obviously it's gonna differ by country,
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]   who are administering these things
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000]   sort of on the basis of what they're reading
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000]   in these studies that you all are publishing,
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]   but also expanding on and experimenting hippie flips
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000]   and combination drugs and ketamine and et cetera.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000]   But let's leave ketamine out for right now
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]   because it's legal, but there's that.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000]   Then there's the, I don't wanna say,
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000]   it's a recreational/open market, black market.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000]   And here I wanna raise a flag to the fact
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000]   that Dr. Peter Attia did a terrific podcast on this recently
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]   in his own podcast, The Drive.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000]   The fact that fentanyl, lacing with fentanyl
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]   is now showing up in MDMA and psychedelics
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]   that are purchased on the street.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]   So serious caution to those getting it
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000]   from uncertain sources.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000]   And then you've got pharma.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000]   And then as an umbrella for all of this,
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000]   you've got the FDA and law enforcement agencies,
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000]   which currently say this stuff is illegal
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]   unless it's being used in a clinical trial.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000]   Selling it or possessing it
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000]   can get you charged with a crime ranging from,
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]   because I don't know, but I'm up to felonies, right?
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]   Years in prison, okay.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.000]   So can't take it through airports,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000]   don't get caught with it, don't buy it,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]   don't sell it kind of thing.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000]   So where are we going from that picture of these silos?
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000]   I know things are in clinical trials now.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000]   Most people, including myself,
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000]   are not familiar with how the different phases
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]   relate to the proximity to legality.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]   Could you just kind of give us the landscape
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]   and touch on how long you think it will be
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000]   before the people that come through your trials
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]   could then go get a prescription for psilocybin
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000]   or potentially buy it without the risk
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000]   from a reliable source one would hope,
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000]   but without the risk of getting thrown in jail.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000]   I used to live in Oakland, California.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000]   My understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong folks,
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]   don't trust this information and get in trouble.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]   My understanding is that psilocybin
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000]   is decriminalized in Oakland,
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000]   but that's not the same as being legal.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000]   So what is going on out there?
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000]   - Wow, well, so much.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000]   - Yeah, I just asked 55 questions.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000]   - I know.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000]   - But feel free to answer just a sub-side of them
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000]   if you like.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000]   - Well, Oakland's a funny one.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000]   I live close to Oakland.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000]   There are head shops in Oakland
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000]   that might be selling cannabis
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000]   and cannabis-related paraphernalia
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000]   that are selling mushrooms as well, psilocybin.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000]   Mushrooms as well, psilocybin mushrooms.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000]   - That's a fact. - Openly, yeah.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000]   - That's a fact.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000]   I can verify that.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000]   I haven't purchased them,
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000]   but I've gone in and kind of checked it out
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]   like what's going on here.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000]   - Yeah, so the police aren't going to prioritize
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000]   that activity, the purchasing of those mushrooms
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000]   as a crime now in Oakland
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000]   because of the decriminalization.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.000]   So those head shops shouldn't strictly be selling.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]   Well, they shouldn't be selling.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000]   They won't have a license to be selling.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.000]   Licenses don't exist yet for that here.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:21.000]   But let's see whether they get shut down.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]   They probably will, I don't know.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000]   But there's a church in Oakland
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   that say that they're selling
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.000]   and it's part of sort of religious rights
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000]   and they're using that church model as a loophole,
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000]   you know, the way that Native Americans can use peyote
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000]   and they have a more genuine case, I think,
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000]   because there is a history there.
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000]   They're trying to kind of piggyback on that.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000]   Anyway, that's sort of close to where we are right now.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000]   But federally, which is really the major inflection point,
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.000]   is the FDA and the licensing of psychedelics as medicines
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000]   to be legally prescribed across the country,
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]   across the US and beyond.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000]   That is close because the key phase,
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000]   so there are different phases of clinical trials
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000]   and the key one to know about is phase three.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]   Phase three trials are licensing trials.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]   If they're successful, and typically you have to do
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.000]   at least two successful ones, show the results
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.000]   to the regulators who are the FDA, the medicine regulators,
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000]   and say is this good enough now for you to give me a license
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.000]   so that I can sell and provide this medicine
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000]   that we've demonstrated is a medicine.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000]   So that work has been done with MDMA therapy
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000]   for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000]   MAPS have led that work and done two phase three trials.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]   I think they've already publicly announced
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000]   that the second trial had results consistent with the first.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000]   We know the results of the first because they're published
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000]   and they were remarkably good,
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000]   something like 67% remission rates.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000]   - And long-term, my understanding is
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000]   some of those remission rates for trauma were years,
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000]   which is different than what you're describing for psilocybin
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]   where people might need ongoing dosing.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000]   - That's true, yeah, yeah.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000]   - But of course, just for trauma in those trials,
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000]   my understanding is those MDMA trials
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000]   were not focused on depression.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000]   - Yes, yes, focused on the trauma.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:37.000]   So that's something because that data is being filed now
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000]   to my knowledge, like as we speak,
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000]   and they're anticipating a decision maybe this year
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000]   with rollout happening as early as next year.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000]   I mean, that's sort of best case, I think.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]   - Could I ask you, when you say rollout,
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000]   and it's the appropriate term for MDMA,
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000]   so-called rolling, about 20% of my audience,
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:03.000]   maybe 50 will understand that not funny joke that I made,
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000]   who's going to roll it out?
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000]   Where would one get the clean source of MDMA,
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000]   meaning not laced with fentanyl,
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000]   not laced with methamphetamine,
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.000]   not undergone any chemical conversion to some other drug
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000]   that might happen with extended shelf life, et cetera?
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.000]   Are people going to go to their psychiatrist to get MDMA,
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000]   and who's going to be providing it?
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000]   Is it going to be some big major pharma?
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000]   This seems like a serious set of issues.
[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000]   - It is, and I don't have all the answers.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000]   I do know that MAPS would be providing
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000]   because they've done the work,
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000]   and they have set themselves up, in a sense,
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:50.000]   to potentially become the provider,
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000]   whether as a pharma company,
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000]   which is the big question they're wrestling with
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000]   at the moment.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.000]   It's very expensive to become a pharma company.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000]   - And yet they probably deserve to make the choice
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000]   because they put in so many years of hard work
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]   when all of this stuff was considered
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000]   like raver culture, party drug.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.000]   They were the ones that spotted the therapeutic potential.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.000]   I mean, we knew there was therapeutic potential
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]   based on work going back many decades,
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.000]   but points to them, and I think, in my opinion,
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000]   they should have the agency to make those decisions.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000]   - It's such a remarkable thing that's been achieved,
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:32.000]   and I think they've done it all on philanthropic donations.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000]   I think so.
[02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.000]   Yeah, so there is this big question mark,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000]   and the FDA are also asking questions
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:48.000]   about, to your question, who can provide this?
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000]   Because in the phase three work and up until this point,
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.000]   there's been a MAPS training, a MAPS therapist training,
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000]   and you have to do this formal training
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000]   in order to be a practitioner within the trials.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000]   But now there's a question from the FDA
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:09.000]   whether that MAPS training can be the training
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000]   that a clinician has to have to now be a provider.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000]   And when I say rollout,
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.000]   it's like offering this as a service, essentially.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]   And so where would the referral come from?
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000]   That's a good question that I'm not 100% on the answer,
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000]   whether it would have to come from a psychiatrist
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000]   or whether someone's sort of general physician
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000]   could do that referral.
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.000]   So there will be going to a provider who is licensed
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000]   and certified and will have done some training,
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000]   and there will be a consensus on what constitutes
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000]   good enough training to provide.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000]   There will also be some stipulations
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.000]   on the basic underlying professionalism
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000]   of the clinician who provides.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000]   So I imagine they'll have to be a mental health professional.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000]   I don't think they would have to necessarily
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000]   be a psychiatrist.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000]   I'm a clinical psychologist.
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000]   For all the dosings, I think, without question,
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000]   there would have to be a physician present
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.000]   or at least within ready access in case of an emergency.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000]   Yeah, especially with MDMA,
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.000]   because of the propensity for cardiac issues,
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000]   because of the amphetamine properties.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000]   And where is psilocybin in terms of the phase trials?
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]   Is it in phase two, phase three?
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]   It's in phase three.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000]   It's psilocybin therapy work being done
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000]   for treatment-resistant depression
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000]   by a company called Compass.
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000]   Those trials, which are always multi-site,
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.000]   so there's always a bunch of teams or labs,
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000]   in a sense, geographically spread out
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000]   that are each contributing to data
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000]   that then gets masked together
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000]   and is then submitted as part of the phase three trial results.
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000]   So that's happening with Compass right now.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000]   It's the second phase of psilocybin therapy
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000]   for treatment-resistant depression.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000]   Those trials have just started
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000]   and I think the earliest estimate that I heard
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.000]   in a journalistic article was,
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000]   because I don't think Compass would say
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000]   or they wouldn't say publicly,
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000]   something like 2026.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000]   2026, wow.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000]   So MDMA is ahead of psilocybin.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000]   Yeah, it's quite a few years ahead
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000]   and it's more of a, not a certainty,
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.000]   but it's a very, very strong position with MDMA,
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.000]   whereas the work's only just begun with psilocybin
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000]   in terms of the phase three trials.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000]   But then you have this other situation
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000]   of like however many psychedelic research centres
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000]   there are now across the globe.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.000]   It was nice to, you know,
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]   we had the first one in London in 2019.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000]   First one in 2019 is 2023 now
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000]   and I don't know how many there are,
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000]   but so much has happened in such a small space of time.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000]   Yes, but, you know, all these different indications
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]   I've been able to tell you about anorexia
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000]   and fibromyalgia syndrome,
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000]   trying to do a trial with a colleague of mine at UCSF
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000]   in methamphetamine use disorder.
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:21.000]   He's got a trial going on in Parkinson's disease
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:26.000]   and chronic lower back pain and bipolar disorder.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]   I mean, there's so much going on, OCD,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000]   almost the full gamut of psychiatric disorders,
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.000]   not schizophrenia to my knowledge,
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000]   are being looked at.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000]   So there's so much ground, you know,
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000]   groundswell of activity
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000]   and I think these small investigator-led studies,
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000]   typically they're small because trials are expensive,
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000]   are going to be reporting positive results.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000]   I know what we're seeing and it will be, you know,
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:59.000]   four, let's see now, at least four trials,
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000]   all with really positive results
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000]   and very difficult to treat disorders
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000]   and that's just us and I know there's so much elsewhere,
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000]   addiction disorders as well, you know,
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000]   Matt Johnson's work obviously, Michael Bogan shoots.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000]   So all this compelling groundswell,
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]   it's really something and yet, you know,
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000]   the system to really make a big breakthrough
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000]   in terms of licensing is, of course, slow
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:29.000]   and that can frustrate people, but it has to,
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000]   it has to be done properly.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000]   - Yeah, else we revert back to what happened in the '70s
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000]   where there was a lot of interest in psychedelics.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000]   It's kind of interesting to me,
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000]   there was a close juxtaposition of meditation
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000]   and kind of behavioral approaches
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000]   to self-directed state change and psychedelics.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000]   Meditation kind of made it through the hatch.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000]   I mean, there were some years where it was considered
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.000]   kind of counterculture, woo, magic carpet, weirdo stuff
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000]   by Western science, but now, I mean,
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000]   there are probably tens of thousands,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000]   it's not an overstatement of quality studies
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.000]   exploring how meditation can provide advantages
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.000]   for the mind and even for mental health
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000]   and psychedelics are now catching up,
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]   but they used to be close cousins
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000]   in the cultural framework.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.000]   But the problem was, I think,
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.000]   psychedelics were viewed as making people crazy
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000]   and university professors lost their jobs
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000]   for having discussions like the one
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000]   that you and I are having right now.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.000]   And some people went to jail, but mostly people
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.000]   either left academic institutions or lost their jobs,
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]   whereas now these are some of the studies of the sort
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]   that you are doing and that are taking place at Stanford
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000]   and Hopkins and elsewhere are some of the greatest
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000]   magnetic pull for philanthropy for universities.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000]   Donors are very interested in supporting these sorts
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.000]   of studies because they and their family members
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]   and people they know suffer from psychiatric illness
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.000]   for which the current big pharma approaches
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000]   simply have not worked.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000]   So it's sort of interesting to me that what once was seen
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000]   as kind of poison is now being viewed
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000]   as a potential therapeutic.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000]   It's not just interesting.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000]   I think it's, hopefully it speaks to the evolution
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000]   of the human species.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000]   People seem to be becoming more open-minded
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000]   about becoming more open-minded.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000]   - Right, that's a good one.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]   Yeah.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.000]   And yet, yeah, it's, there's so much that's happening
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.000]   so fast and there's, you know, there are elements of,
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000]   it's complexifying the space.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000]   There is critique, there's been some bad practice
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000]   in psychedelic therapy, boundary crossing issues
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000]   that have caused some scandals.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000]   - That's too bad.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000]   - Isn't it?
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000]   - Yeah, well, you know, I think to the gene therapy, right,
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000]   it just takes one bad incident.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000]   You know, gene therapy was on a fast track three decades ago
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000]   and then sadly a child died in a gene therapy trial
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.000]   and it's like shut down gene therapy practically
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000]   for half a decade and then it slowly started ratcheting
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000]   up again, gene therapy broadly defined it.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]   Now we're in the age of, you know,
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000]   potential directed gene therapy using CRISPR
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]   and things of that sort, which makes people,
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000]   some people cringe and other people very excited.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000]   You know, if you have Huntington's in your family,
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]   CRISPR is like the most exciting technology ever
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]   because you could potentially eliminate it
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]   from your family line.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000]   Going forward, of course.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000]   - So I just really hope that we can be balanced
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000]   as this all plays out because it could go a similar way
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000]   given the stigma, given the history,
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:58.000]   that people be very twitchy with some isolated incidents
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:04.000]   and, you know, over-generalize them perhaps.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.000]   In a sense, shining a light on them I think is important
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.000]   that that has happened recently is important
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.000]   because it really drills home how important it is
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000]   that this work be done right
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000]   and what the necessary safeguards
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.000]   and standards should be.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:31.000]   Yeah, it won't be an easy road forward
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000]   but let's hope, you know, we've got to hope that it succeeds
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000]   because current treatments, you know,
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000]   people talk about the mental health crisis
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:47.000]   and to your point earlier about anorexia rates,
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000]   it's not always actually the case
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000]   when you look at the epidemiology,
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000]   when you look at the data that you see a big inflection
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:59.000]   in, you know, diagnoses or cases of psychiatric illness.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000]   I would say it's more that the treatments haven't moved.
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000]   They haven't really progressed.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000]   They haven't got any better since the 1950s more or less
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:11.000]   and new drugs have been more of the same.
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:14.000]   So there haven't been any paradigm shifts
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000]   and that's why I get a little impassioned
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000]   when I talk about psychedelic therapy
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:21.000]   and that point that this is something different.
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000]   It's not, you know, a drug every day.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000]   That system is not cutting it, you know.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000]   Do we really want to keep on with that system?
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:35.000]   Sure, you know, not everyone will want to trip
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000]   and that will terrify some people so much
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.000]   that they'll just want to be on their Lexapro
[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000]   or a non-psychedelic psychedelic or whatever
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000]   and of course you should be allowed to have those options,
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000]   of course, and the more options the better.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.000]   But I think there is great value
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:58.000]   in really understanding what psychedelic therapy is
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   and I think when you do,
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:04.000]   you realise that it is a major paradigm challenge
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:09.000]   on many levels and the fact that it's different
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:13.000]   might be its greatest appeal at the moment, I think.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000]   Well, I am certainly grateful for your passion
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000]   for the potential for psychedelics
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000]   to be added to the array of potential treatments
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.000]   and I really also appreciate how much you put it in there
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000]   alongside the other treatments.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000]   Maybe even in combination with other treatments
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000]   as opposed to saying this is the thing
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000]   that's going to cure everything
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000]   and yet the passion that you have
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000]   for this potential paradigm shift,
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000]   the one that really appears to be happening
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.000]   at the level of clinical data now is so important.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:50.000]   So I want to extend a voice of gratitude for that
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.000]   and for the work that you're doing.
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:56.000]   I mean, I've been outside of this field
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000]   but as a neuroscientist,
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000]   I've been paying careful attention to it
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000]   really for the last five, seven years or so
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000]   and it's abundantly clear that it is a small group
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000]   of individuals who are really thinking
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000]   in terms of how the system works now
[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:13.000]   and what needs to be done in order to change the system
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000]   for the better, like yourself,
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000]   that are really the driving force
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000]   behind this new movement or paradigm shift
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:25.000]   that without question is going to lead to improvements
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000]   in mental health and physical health outcomes.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.000]   So I just want to say thank you for that.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]   Also, thank you so much for joining us today
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000]   to share this immense knowledge set
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000]   about the history of psychedelics,
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000]   what they are, what they aren't,
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000]   their clinical applications
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000]   as seen in your laboratory and other laboratories.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000]   I'm sure people already noticed this
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]   but you're incredibly generous in terms of attribution
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000]   and also in your caution about explaining
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000]   how some of the results in particular
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000]   on anorexia fibromyalgia are perhaps preliminary
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000]   but very exciting.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000]   They're not published yet anyway.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000]   We wouldn't call them preliminary.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000]   And also for touching on mechanism
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000]   that is not just about people feel better
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000]   but pointed to some potential underlying mechanisms
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.000]   in terms of connectivity changes and on and on.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000]   So thank you so much for your time today.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000]   Thank you for the work that you're doing
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000]   and thank you for the work that is sure to continue.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000]   We will provide links to studies in your laboratory,
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000]   links to your laboratory so people can learn more
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000]   and support in the ways that they deem appropriate for them.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.000]   But just thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]   Such important work you're doing, Robin.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000]   - Thank you, Andrew, it's been a pleasure.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]   for my discussion with Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000]   about the science and clinical uses of psychedelics as I did.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000]   If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Carhart-Harris' research
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]   or support that research
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000]   or inquire into being a research subject
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000]   in one of his laboratory studies,
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]   please see the links in the show note captions.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000]   In addition, please see the links to his Twitter account
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000]   and other social media accounts also in the show note captions.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000]   Also in the show note captions,
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000]   you'll find a link to Dr. Carhart-Harris' Twitter account
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000]   where he regularly posts about new advances
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000]   in the field of psychedelic science.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000]   or suggestions about guests you'd like me
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000]   to include on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000]   I do read all the comments.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000]   we discussed supplements.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000]   from things like improving sleep, hormone support,
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000]   as well as focus.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000]   So that's Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000]   And on all those platforms, I post about science
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]   and science-related tools, some of which overlaps
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:24.000]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000]   the neural network newsletter is a monthly newsletter
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000]   in which we distill down the essential points
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.000]   of particular podcasts, and we list out toolkits,
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000]   such as toolkits for sleep, toolkits for neuroplasticity,
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:46.000]   toolkits for optimizing dopamine, and on and on,
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000]   all of which is available at zero cost.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000]   go to the newsletter, and supply your email,
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]   for today's discussion with Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000]   [upbeat music]
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.060]   you
