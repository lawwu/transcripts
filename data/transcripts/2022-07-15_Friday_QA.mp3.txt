[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.360]   It's Friday and today, back from vacation to do live Q&A.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.440]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.440]   Today is Friday, July 15, 2022 and today, after an extended break for a summer vacation,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.920]   we are back at it with live Q&A.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.040]   Open phone lines, call in, talk about anything you want.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.120]   If this is your first time on a Friday Q&A show, welcome.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.840]   We're glad that you are here.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.880]   These shows work just like traditional call-in talk radio has worked.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.520]   You call in, you ask me about anything that you want, talk about any questions that you
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.920]   have, happy to talk about details of your personal situation, happy to opine on anything
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   that you have questions on, anything you want clarifications, happy to hear any disagreements,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   anything that you want.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920]   I don't screen the calls.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.600]   Well, I don't screen the subjects of the calls.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   I do screen the calls in terms of publishing the phone number.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.920]   If you would like to join me for one of these Friday Q&A shows, you do that by becoming
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280]   a patron of the show at patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   Search Patreon for Radical Personal Finance, become a patron of the show and that gains
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.160]   you access to the time and the phone number to be able to call in and join me on a Friday
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   Q&A show.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.140]   By doing it that way, it simply allows me to make sure that I have positioned things
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.200]   to not be overwhelmed with too many calls.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.520]   I try to handle anywhere from five to ten calls on one of these Q&A shows and if I didn't
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.880]   do that, I would simply have far too many.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.640]   We begin today with John in Pittsburgh.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   John, welcome.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240]   Hey Joshua, thanks for taking the call.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   Welcome back.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.760]   I had a question about opening a Canadian bank account.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.840]   I thought it was going to be, I mean, pretty much seems to be the simplest, one of the
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.760]   early steps I can take to getting some money out of the US.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.000]   But in calling around to the different banks I was going to go visit in the next few weeks,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.240]   I noticed that a couple of them mentioned the same thing, which is that it's not possible
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.000]   to do a direct, once I have the accounts open, it's not possible to do a direct bank to bank
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   transfer from the US to Canada.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.120]   Instead, you have to wire transfer the money.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.360]   With that limitation, do you still think it's, I mean, it's probably still worth having those
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.040]   accounts established and set up, but it kind of takes away from some of the ability to
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   do frequent transfers just to get them used to seeing the money going back and forth.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.000]   Or maybe I'm just talking to the wrong banks.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It is a limitation.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.920]   So each bank will have a different system, but you're dealing with an international bank
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   and the international banking system is different than what you're accustomed to with the domestic
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.600]   banking system.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.200]   So usually you will do a wire over the SWIFT international transfer system.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.080]   And so you'll do a wire or a lot of times banks can take checks and you can deposit
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.860]   banks by, or you can deposit funds via a check.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.760]   So it is possible to use a Canadian bank account for your regular banking, depending on the
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.320]   specific bank and depending on the specific features that they offer you.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.720]   So you want to ask them, but usually it doesn't make a lot of sense to do frequent transactions
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.360]   with an international bank account because of the increased fees due to international
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.720]   transfers.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.920]   So usually it makes sense to have just a few transactions.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   And for example, at the most frequent, you might, again, if you have an account with
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.960]   check writing privileges, then you can write some checks and those will be cash based upon
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.500]   the terms of the banks.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.640]   You will find that because you're dealing with an international bank, if you're dealing
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.080]   with an institution that is skeptical about checks, and it just kind of feels like we're
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   in the 1980s here, you do have an international, it's an international account.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   So you're going to have less acceptance with your check systems.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.320]   Your debit card will work fine.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.000]   And so if you have a bank that has reasonable prices on international transactions, then
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.120]   the debit card can work fine.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.160]   But usually if you were going to keep most of your money in an international account,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.360]   then you would do something like keep your money there and then just pay your credit
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.260]   card bill once a month from it, things like that.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.960]   What you can do is check to see if your bank will accept paper deposits.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   Every bank will be different.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.800]   Sometimes, for example, you might have some of your checks sent there.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.560]   Sometimes you can just simply use the automatic bill pay function from your US based account
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.920]   and send a check that way that can minimize the fees.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   But you are right.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.960]   And so I don't think it makes a lot of sense to use an international bank account for day-to-day
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.120]   transactions.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.440]   I think it makes sense to use a credit card for day-to-day transactions.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   And then if you really want to use the account frequently and not just have it as a savings
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.360]   device, then go ahead and set it up with just to pay your, you know, pay your credit card
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.600]   once a month.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.800]   So it is the information that you have is correct and the specifics will depend upon
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.720]   each specific bank that you interact with.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   Okay.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   That makes sense.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.280]   And to be clear, the only reason I'm looking to have more transactions or more frequent
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.640]   transactions both ways was just for the sole purpose of just having them accustomed to
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.240]   seeing transactions going in and out, not really for day-to-day banking or anything
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   like that.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.560]   So, yeah, for that reason, I think I'm just going to go with a pretty low-end checking
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.040]   and savings type of account that has pretty limited withdrawals and stuff before you start
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   racking up fees.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.320]   But if it's just for emergencies only, that seemed to be sufficient.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   So, and now that I can go to Canada, I figured I'd get that done.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   Exactly.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.960]   And just, and as always, be aware in the international banking space, you will incur significantly
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.600]   higher fees than you're accustomed to in the United States.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.560]   Yeah, seems like it.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.480]   So it's just, you know, a monthly account maintenance fee is an extremely normal thing
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.160]   in the space of international banking.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.760]   It's fairly abnormal in the United States, but it's an extremely normal thing in international
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.040]   banking.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.720]   So monthly maintenance fees, various fees, the fees are simply higher in the international
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.080]   world, practically, at least in my understanding, on a global basis as compared to the United
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   States.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.600]   I still think that's a cheap price to pay for the services that you are getting.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.260]   But if you are very fee sensitive, then it will impact you and you'll want to minimize
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.280]   those fees just through prudent planning.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.360]   I don't think you need to do transactions on a, you know, on a multiple transactions
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   per month basis.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.640]   I think the most important thing to set up is to set up your wire transfer systems.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.200]   If you're using a Canadian bank account as basically kind of a relief valve, a backup
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.800]   plan in case you had to get money out of the United States, then the key is just making
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.920]   sure that you know how to wire money, you know how long it takes, you have all the information
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.120]   handy, so you could call up your bank and say, wire $50,000 from my US account to my
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.940]   Canadian account, and that you know how to do it and you know how long to expect that
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.160]   settlement process to take, etc.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   So you don't need to, of course, start with 50 grand.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.480]   The key is just go ahead and practice going back and forth so that when the time comes,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.840]   if you ever needed to do it, that you can do it very quickly and you've practiced it.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   >>Yeah, no, that sounds good.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   I appreciate that.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   That's exactly what I was going to do.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:50.200]   Just put up a minimal amount that gets me, you know, semi-free checking accounts and
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.000]   probably open up one for both me and my wife.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.840]   So we both have some options there.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.320]   >>Yeah, the magic number is to have enough money in the account that you don't wind up
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.840]   incurring fees based upon the account balance, but to have, if you want to minimize your
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.280]   reporting requirements in the United States, to keep less than $10,000 outside the country
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.040]   so you don't have to file the extra disclosure forms.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.220]   It's fine to file the disclosure forms, but if you keep less than $10,000 total outside
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.680]   of the United States, then you can minimize those forms.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   We go to Lucas in New Jersey.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   Lucas, welcome.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   >>Hey, Joshua.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   Thanks for taking the call.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:33.760]   I'm underway on the Mexican temporary residence process, and so I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.960]   I got the temporary visa, so I found out part of that is going to Mexico to actually get
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   the card.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.760]   And from what the agent was telling me at the consulate, there's some requirements in
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:55.480]   there about time to renew the card within, I think it was 55 days before expiration to
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.220]   get it to the three year.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.160]   But she also mentioned that it would be difficult to say at this point how long that process
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.600]   takes to go from the temporary residence visa to the card.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.720]   So a little more complicated than I initially anticipated.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.920]   And I know previously you had recommended using lawyers in the local areas where you're
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.040]   planning to do any international planning.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.760]   And so, one, do you still recommend that, using a lawyer for immigration purposes, even
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.960]   for Mexico, which is pretty simple comparatively?
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.280]   And two, are there any resources that you've used to find international services like lawyers,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.000]   accountants, things like that?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.560]   I'm a little sensitive to hiring someone for a service like that who I haven't vetted,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   and I'm not sure how to do that internationally.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   Understood.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.520]   So, the answer is, so just to clarify, at this point you have gone to the consulate
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.360]   outside of Mexico, you've received the little paper sticker into your passport saying that
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   – Correct.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.840]   And now you need to go to Mexico for the CANJE.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   Is that right?
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840]   Correct.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Okay.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   So, yes.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.360]   So as I've said, in most things you can do most of the stuff yourself.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.760]   Most countries have some kind of system that you can go on their website, you can work
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.360]   your way through, you can set the appointments, and you can do most of these things yourself.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.600]   So you don't need to hire lawyers in the world of international immigration.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.620]   You can do it yourself.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:33.480]   My experience, having done it myself and having hired lawyers, is that immigration lawyers
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.960]   or immigration consultants are worth every penny in terms of minimizing hassle and making
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.040]   stuff easy for you.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.760]   So when I went to Mexico, I speak Spanish, I'm perfectly fine, I could have gone and
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.120]   figured it out, but it's just so much easier to use a lawyer who says, "Show up on this
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.800]   day and you show up, all the papers are signed, you show up, they walk you up to the immigration
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:06.000]   official, you sit down, they walk you up to the immigration official, the appointments
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.880]   are set up, the official has all the papers, everything's taken care of, you sit there,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.200]   you walk out ten minutes later and you're done with the whole thing."
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.000]   And that's worth so much more than trying to navigate the world of bureaucracy, especially
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   in Latin America.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.240]   There are some places where the bureaucracy is fairly streamlined.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.120]   So can you do Canadian Express entry yourself?
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   You can.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.040]   I still think you should use a consultant, unless you're totally broke.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.960]   I think it's worth your time just to use a consultant, but you can do a lot of it yourself.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.200]   But if you compare the Canadian system versus the Mexican system, the Mexican system is
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.800]   so much more... the bureaucracy in Latin America is really, really intense.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:50.680]   And so basically what you pay for with a lawyer or a consultant is to make your life easy
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.920]   and to make all of your planning easy.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.120]   And my experience, again, having done it myself and having not done it myself, I have promised
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.000]   myself that going forward I'm generally just always going to use a lawyer.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.240]   Because when I compare my experience with...
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.400]   I've done two programs with lawyers and consultants and I've done one program myself.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.960]   When I compare my experience in those areas, it's just night and day better with a lawyer.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.520]   So yes, I do still recommend it.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.800]   And I can't tell you how to actually navigate the bureaucracy yourself if you want to do
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:26.160]   it, because it will depend upon a state by state basis, a city by city basis, and even
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.560]   an office by office basis.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.960]   And it's very difficult to figure out what to actually do from the internet.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.720]   You and I are generally fairly accustomed to doing everything online.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   But although there's been major modernization in many of the international immigration programs
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.880]   that you can do more things online, and in fact they'll often require you to do things
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   online, right?
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.080]   I'm sure the Mexican consulate required you to establish an appointment online and all
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.660]   that stuff online.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.240]   But when you try to do it online with systems that aren't fully self-explanatory and you're
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.400]   trying to do it in a second language, and you're trying to interpret what the second
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.480]   language means in a legal context to figure out exactly how to do it, it is complex.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.760]   So the answer to question number one, do I recommend a lawyer?
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.840]   Yes, I do.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.240]   If you hire a lawyer, right?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.760]   I've had Miguel from San Miguel Legal on.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:27.800]   If you work with him, Sanmiguel-legal.com, or not, sorry, not Miguel, blanking on his
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   name.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.880]   But if you hire him and his firm, basically you send him all the stuff, he arranges everything
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.800]   in advance, you tell him the day that you're going to come to Mexico, you show up in Mexico,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.860]   you go to the office, his team meets you there, you basically need to be there for two days
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.640]   in essence, and everything is just handled.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:54.840]   And that makes the process really, really simple.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.880]   And that's why I recommend it.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   I think time is money, and the hassle is pretty intense.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   Now, if you were, and this is clearly not you, but if you were 22 years old and you
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.880]   want to live in Mexico, and you're actually in Mexico, and you can go down to the office
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.400]   and you can talk to a person and they'll give you a brochure and they'll say, "Here, here's
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.720]   how you go through the brochure yourself, step by step."
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.220]   Yeah, you can do it yourself, totally.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.400]   So I want to be clear, it is totally possible to do it yourself, but it's just harder to
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.000]   do yourself not being physically in the country that you're trying to accomplish the immigration
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.440]   process for.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.880]   Number two, how do you find international services?
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.960]   I'd say the two common ways, number one is through a referral.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.760]   If you know someone who has done something, has been happy with their service provider,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.360]   that's usually the number one way.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.720]   So when I make a referral, sanmiguel-legal.com, I'm pointing you and saying, "Hey, this is
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.200]   a good firm, they do a good job, reach out to them, see if you can get in touch with
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.200]   them."
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   That's the number one way.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.960]   So if you have a friend of yours who's done it or you know someone who's done it, then
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.720]   that's a good way to get a referral.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:12.120]   Or number two, I think it's perfectly fine to go with a firm that advertises their services
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.000]   in this way.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.880]   There's not much of a vetting process necessary for this kind of thing, right?
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.720]   This is not like you're hiring a lawyer to defend you for a murder trial, where you've
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.960]   got, that's a much more difficult thing to do.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:32.240]   This is pretty much a, what's the right word, an administrative process and it doesn't require
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.360]   a significant, it just requires experience.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.320]   So if you find a firm that advertises, that they say, "Hey, I want to do Panama," and
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.040]   you do a web search for Panama immigration lawyer, you'll find all kinds of firms.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   And if they just feel legit and you talk to them and they sound legit, I think that's
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   good enough.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   What you can simply do is you can protect, you know, search for reviews of course, but
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.600]   it's a fairly straightforward business and you'll generally make an upfront payment of
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.960]   some kind and then you'll pay the balance when the services are rendered and you'll
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.840]   be able to figure out whether the services are actually being rendered properly.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:19.000]   So there's, it is harder to do due diligence, but if an outfit is advertising their services,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.400]   they're holding themselves out as doing this work with a website and they are maybe actually
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.080]   advertising somewhere and it feels normal, I think that's good enough.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.440]   I'm not aware of this being an area of widespread fraud.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:39.760]   Now it is true that you will generally have a different service standard with kind of
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.080]   local firms, right?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.640]   So one of the classic things is, let's say you go into a totally new country and you
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.000]   say, "I want to hire a lawyer."
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.400]   Well you'll find that you're going to get a different service standard if you just kind
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.280]   of hire a guy because his shingle out front says lawyer.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.000]   But the amount of work someone puts into their website is a good indication of their stability
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.160]   as a firm.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.800]   So I've hired four lawyers in the international immigration affairs on different things and
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.360]   I've just done it based upon, if I had a referral I've used that and I've done it just based
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.600]   upon personally their website, finding them with a web search, saying, "Hey, this feels
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.360]   right," and going with it and haven't had any problems.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.880]   >>JAMES: Okay, great.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   Thank you.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.080]   I may reach out to San Miguel Legal and ask for referrals in certain areas that if I'm
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.280]   going to be spending a couple of days in Mexico to do this, I'd like it to be in an area that
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.720]   is particular to my interests.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.840]   So I'll start with that as a referral process.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.840]   I really appreciate it.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   Thank you.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   >>TREVOR: My pleasure.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.160]   All right, we move on to Trey in Texas.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   Trey, welcome to the show.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.920]   >>TREY: Hey Joshua.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:03.400]   So I made a pitch to my wife two nights ago about her potentially taking a couple of years
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:10.320]   off from work and staying home with our one-year-old and the potential new kids to come along during
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.720]   that time.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.520]   And then the very next day you dropped a new podcast that talks about how important it
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   is to protect your income.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   I thought, "Uh-oh."
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:26.600]   So I kind of wanted to talk through that with you, and I'm happy to share numbers if you
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   want.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.320]   But how do you kind of weigh those two things against each other?
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.920]   And just to give you a real quick picture of our scenario.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:48.400]   My income is more than sufficient to cover our lifestyle, assuming that we downsize from
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:55.240]   two properties into one, which is a perfectly reasonable change to make.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.040]   And then, yeah, that's basically it.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.520]   So I'm fully remote, and I think it would make a big quality of life improvement if
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.240]   we didn't have to deal with two jobs where she's actually at a brick and mortar job.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.320]   And we could downsize into one property for a few years, kids start going to school, then
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.240]   school district or whatever we're going to do there, based on that.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.040]   So I think it's important to begin.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:28.440]   My answer to your question is, I believe the analysis is done from a different perspective.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.960]   Financially speaking, I can't think of a scenario where I could argue to say that you're going
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.040]   to be financially...
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   There is...
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   I can, so let me change what I'm saying.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.760]   In most situations, if you have a dual income household, and you turn that dual income household
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   into a single income household, there's going to be a financial cost to that decision.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.720]   You're going to have less money coming in the door, and unless there's an offsetting
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:08.240]   ability to increase income, then it's simply going to result in there's less income, we
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:16.320]   may have a lower lifestyle, financially speaking, and we may minimize our long-term wealth accumulation.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:24.480]   The only way where that doesn't work is kind of the classic high performer profile.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.920]   So if you look at when you have a family where someone is a very high performer, I always
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.480]   think about, I don't know, for whatever reason, years ago when I worked at Northwestern Mutual,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.000]   I think he's still the CEO as far as I know, there was a guy named John Schliske who was
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:48.440]   the CEO, and he had six children, and he was the CEO of this huge insurance company.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:57.480]   It is not possible for a guy like John Schliske to be the CEO of a huge insurance company
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:03.640]   and to have six children unless his wife is a full-time mother.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.600]   It's simply not possible.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   You cannot do it.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   You cannot maintain that much responsibility, have a C-level job, have a huge business or
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.600]   a huge job.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:20.720]   You cannot do that and also be a parent unless you have a wife, or I guess it could be either
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.440]   way, unless you have a wife who is taking care of your children and who is managing
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   their needs.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.280]   Otherwise, your kids are going to be a nightmare.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   It's just a disaster.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.880]   It's simply not possible.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.280]   Now, does it make sense for, in that situation, again, I have no idea.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.240]   Maybe John Schliske's wife actually does have some high-flying career as well.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.320]   I don't know that, but I don't know what I'm saying for a fact.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.560]   I always thought about him in this example.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:57.160]   If you try to maintain two incomes, then you can't do it if you're parents.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.600]   You could do it as individuals without children, but you can't do it as parents because the
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   stress and the constraints of children are going to mean that you cannot deliver at the
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.680]   very highest level in a job.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:18.440]   If John and his wife were both trying to maintain these jobs, they would leave the house at
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.400]   six in the morning, they'd get home at six at night, seven o'clock at night, see the
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.640]   children for an hour, and they would have to hire literally everything done for their
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.320]   children and they would still get bad results because they wouldn't have any kind of relationship
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.480]   with their children.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.460]   Now, if John can go to work and his wife is able to make sure that the children are properly
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.160]   kissed and get their teeth brushed when they're going out the door to school, and then when
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.440]   they come home from school, she can help arrange the taxi services to get them to their events,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.280]   make sure their homework gets done, make sure she's there to listen to their successes and
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.640]   their failures, etc., that division of labor can work out really, really well for John
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.440]   and for his wife, in my example.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.280]   You can have John make, I don't know, $15 million a year, $20 million, I don't know,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.760]   several millions of dollars per year, and his wife can benefit from a multi-million
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.800]   dollar per year income, and her division of labor is that she provides the warm, loving
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   environment for the children, and John is there a little bit at night and a little bit
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.040]   on the weekends, right?
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.240]   That's the common thing, and you see that.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.720]   So if you go through the C-level suites of big companies and find high performers, I
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:33.040]   don't think you'll find high performers who are parents who are at the very highest levels
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.200]   who don't have a stay-at-home spouse who's able to take care of their children.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.600]   Just doesn't happen.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.080]   So if you... so this is one of the big things.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.800]   And again, I've had friends who I've watched go through this scenario.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.860]   They're trying to build two careers, but they build two careers poorly because both people
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.240]   are struggling and they're trying to be good parents, they're trying to not, and they can't
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.640]   really get that extra... they can't put in that extra work that's necessary to go to
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.120]   the very highest levels in the corporate world because they feel the intensity of their duties
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.760]   in their family life and in their personal life, their marriage relationship, etc.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:17.520]   So if you can have the division of labor, sometimes that can free you up to really invest
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.200]   in your career at a very high level and you can make it to the top levels of management,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.600]   to a seven and eight figure salary, you can build a business that's really big, etc.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.380]   Even things like travel.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.920]   Travel is simply not possible.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.080]   The kind of travel that's necessary for most high-level jobs, it's not possible if you
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.320]   don't have a full-time mother to depend upon to provide the stability that the family needs.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.520]   You can't have two people managing ten days of travel per month.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   It's not possible.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.400]   So outside of that, I think we have to acknowledge that if your wife were to stop earning an
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.640]   income, that's going to be a decrease in the financial income for your family.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.040]   Now is that something that you should do?
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.760]   I think it's very much kind of a matter of vision and lifestyle and a question of is
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.920]   there an investment into our family that can be made up for it.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.560]   So you can minimize the financial impact in some ways.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.980]   So I will frequently help people do an analysis of a second income.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.600]   If you have one income, let's say that your income is higher and she's still working but
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.440]   her income is lower, if you actually look and you say how much is it costing her to
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:35.840]   work, you can say, well, she's working, she's paying the highest marginal tax rate on her
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.240]   income, we have all these work-related expenses, etc.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:46.080]   Then you can mitigate and say maybe it's not as big of a loss as just her gross income
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.400]   number, but it is still going to be a decline.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.560]   So you have to feel like you're getting something else out of it.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.280]   You have to feel like you're getting a lifestyle improvement for you, a lifestyle improvement
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.800]   for her, a lifestyle improvement for your family, for your children.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:06.560]   You have to feel like you're getting some benefit from it that makes it worth the money.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.840]   And that's my conviction is I believe, and my wife would affirm this if she were here,
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.320]   is that for us it's simply a lifestyle decision.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:24.360]   Part of it is that I would not be able to do the things that I can do if we had to manage
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.240]   my job and her job.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.920]   Part of what I already said, so I'm focused on the deal I made with her is I'll take care
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.040]   of the money, I'll make sure that you're rich, I'll make sure that you have everything that
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.440]   you need for the rest of your life, you be part of my family and come along with me.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.340]   And that for her was not a high cost because she was never, my particular wife, never had
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.280]   a strong career ambition, she didn't have a career that was important to her that she
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.560]   wanted to build, etc.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   So that she was good with that.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.040]   It was a good deal for her, it was a good deal for me.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.160]   But it's also a focus on in terms of the kind of family life that we want to have.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.520]   We don't, we never wanted to have one child.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.780]   Well one child you could do it, five children a little different, right?
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.780]   So you want to build a certain career and also we see it as an investment into our children.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:21.960]   So one major part of my goals in life and our family vision, a huge part of it has to
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.080]   do with building a dynasty.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:31.780]   That's a very, very important component of my life vision is to build a dynasty and to
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:37.280]   impact and build the kind of family dynasty that I'll be proud of when I'm a hundred years
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.560]   old and the kind of family dynasty that will impact the world.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:48.900]   And I can't get that unless I put in place a system where I can see to the needs of my
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.520]   children in a really strong way.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:57.360]   And so the investment, right now as I record this, my wife is doing Fun Friday with the
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.120]   children and they've done schooling all week, they've done all kinds of things and yet she's
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.960]   still there with them and she's training them and she's working with them.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   We don't have a perfect family, we have many challenges, but she's laser focused on that
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.100]   and that's an incredible part of it.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.360]   So if you look at the psychological problems that adults have and you trace them back,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.840]   so much of that stuff is formed in childhood.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.600]   And so when you look at it from an early education perspective, when you look at the values that
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.000]   are formed in children, you look at the vocabulary that is formed in children, you look at the
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.020]   academic ability that is formed in children, you look at the emotional security that is
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:43.640]   formed in children, those things are best formed with a close relationship with parents.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.040]   And if you believe that, if you're convinced of that, that's part of your family decision,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   it's not a matter of a financial question, it's a matter of this is the lifestyle we
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.120]   want, this is what we want for our family.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.320]   Now you do need to be very conscious of the cost, right?
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.600]   If your wife stopped her job, it comes with a couple of big costs that make her very vulnerable.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:10.140]   Number one is if she stops earning an income, she's entirely dependent and your family is
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.960]   entirely dependent on your ability to earn an income.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.800]   And so you need to make sure that you are a man who is worthy of that responsibility.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.600]   You need to make sure you have a decent income and that you have a strong growth potential
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.760]   for your income.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.520]   You need to make sure your income is properly protected for her, disability income insurance,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.600]   life insurance, prudent financial management.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.440]   It will come with a significant cost for her in her career, depending on what her vision
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   is.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.280]   If she's a mother and she takes six years out of a career and she comes back, she will
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.240]   from a career perspective, she'll be behind her peers who didn't take time off out of
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.860]   the workforce to raise children.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:57.440]   If she is a longer term mother and say she takes 10 years out, it'll make a huge difference
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.480]   in her lifetime earnings, it'll make a huge difference in her relevance in the career
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.020]   field, etc.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.840]   So there are substantial costs for her if she made that decision.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:12.360]   You have to be convinced that those costs are worth it and that this is something that
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:18.320]   you want as a couple and that you are committed to and it's part of your lifestyle.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.080]   For me, I've never imagined it any other way.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.800]   I wouldn't do it any other way.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.540]   I love, as I have stated publicly for it, I love the lifestyle that comes with the decisions
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.120]   that we have made.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.560]   But it's not something that is without cost.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.520]   It very clearly is and it needs to be something that's your conviction and her conviction
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.280]   and kind of your shared vision as a family of what you want and the kind of lifestyle
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:51.880]   that you want and not just, "Oh, okay, kind of a random thing."
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.280]   I think it's a pretty good deal for her if you're the kind of man who could do it.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   My wife has a great deal.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:03.320]   It's funny, I posted a tweet, Alex Hormozy tweeted out, I think he said something like,
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.920]   "Marrying rich is the least discussed pathway to passive income."
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.760]   I've often thought about that.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.880]   It's kind of funny, but we don't discuss it.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.800]   I've often thought to myself that marrying rich or marrying someone who wants a stay-at-home
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:25.520]   wife is one of the fastest paths to financial independence, a financial independence lifestyle
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.720]   that it can be.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:34.040]   It's hard to suggest that as an actual course of action given the various risks that are
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.440]   involved.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.360]   But I think it's a pretty good deal.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.880]   My wife, ever since we had our first child, she calls me money bag sheets.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.200]   When she needs money, she comes to me and she's got enough.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.240]   Any money she has, she has no budget.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.080]   She can spend whatever money she wants.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.160]   She just simply has to maintain and help pull the home together.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.240]   We work hard to make sure she has the support that she needs.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.880]   I don't intend for her ever to have to earn income for the rest of her life.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.520]   It can work into a really great teamwork scenario, but it is one of those things that you've
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:17.280]   got to be very careful in the modern world where there's a very big difference in vision.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.960]   You have to recognize that if your wife does that, it does expose her to some significant
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.880]   – it makes her vulnerable, more vulnerable.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.840]   You have a responsibility to honor her and to protect her in that and to make sure that
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.000]   she's going to be better off if she does that than not.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.200]   This is where it's especially difficult.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.960]   Marriage, family relationships are very difficult for men and women in 2022 because she has
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:48.000]   to think very carefully about making herself vulnerable in that way and come to the decision.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.680]   That was kind of a deep question.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.560]   Let me say one more thing and then I'll let you respond.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.520]   I would make all those things independent of the comments that I said about maintain
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:03.240]   your income, etc., unless there was something unique to your situation about it.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.180]   The reason is – for example, let's say that you have a bunch of debt and right now
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.640]   you're trying to get out of debt and you're trying to figure out how to solve that and
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.680]   you're five months away from getting out of debt.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.440]   Well, yeah, keep her income for the next five months so you can get out of debt.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.080]   But in terms of macro conditions of the economy or what might or might not have in the next
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.520]   few years, I don't think we can plan those things with enough certainty to actually make
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   personal decisions on them.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:37.040]   So if I knew recession was coming, would I delay marriage?
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.680]   No, just get married, right?
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.640]   If I knew recession was coming and my wife wanted to be a stay-at-home mom or we wanted
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.920]   to have a baby, would I delay having a baby?
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   I wouldn't.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.080]   I would just have a baby.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.240]   How do I know recession is coming?
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   How do I know?
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.280]   We don't have any clue, any certainty of that.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.920]   And these things, these lifestyle decisions are too important to rely upon what might
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.940]   happen in the future from a macroeconomic space.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:10.000]   If I knew recession was coming, would I not go and change jobs or start a business?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.560]   In the macro scale, no.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.800]   If I knew that interest rates were going to triple, would I go and start a mortgage business?
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.480]   No, I wouldn't.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.360]   But would I not go and pursue a job?
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   No, pursue it.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.720]   You want to live your life and focus on pressing forward.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.560]   And as long as you're generally in a good prudent space where you've got most of what
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.720]   you need handled, then I think it just makes sense to press forward and ignore the economy.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   Great.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:42.040]   I mean, I think that last little bit that you said about making the decision independent
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.600]   of any kind of forecast about what the economy is going to do, it's exactly where I was on
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.160]   it too.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.800]   My phone shut off in the middle of it.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:55.240]   I was outside in Texas and got a heat warning on the phone and it just shut off.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.080]   But so I'll go back and listen to the entire comment that you made.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.960]   But just to address a few of the things there at the end, from a security perspective, that
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   was one of my main concerns too.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.040]   Just going from two to one, one is a lot closer to zero income than two is.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:20.680]   But I've had a really stable career for my first 10 years post-college with the same
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:27.400]   company that a promotion like every two years for the last 10 years.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.800]   And the most recent one was like a month ago.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   So I doubt they're going to lay me off.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.480]   And then we've got just a stupid amount of cash that we've just held for no real reason.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.840]   I thought I was going to buy some kind of income property and just hasn't come up.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.880]   And so we've got like 200 grand in the bank right now.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.800]   But if we were to go through with this plan, we would sell one of our homes, move the other
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:56.320]   one, and we'd have like 400,000 in cash, which is like five years worth of cash living fat.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:01.520]   So there's just really not a lot of financial risk in my mind, I don't think.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.760]   Yeah, I don't think you have any financial risk from this.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.320]   The biggest risk would be for her.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.840]   In terms of, and that's what I spent some time talking about, is her career something
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.040]   that's very important to her?
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.880]   Is it a sacrifice for her to leave her career?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.520]   Or is it just a job?
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.560]   Because if it's a career that she says, I've got this 30-year vision of where I want to
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.480]   be in this career 30 years from now, the biggest cost to her if she were to leave her job is
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   not the income.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.920]   The biggest cost to her is five years of lost advancement and experience in the career.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.840]   And so you want to weigh those costs because those are big costs for her.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.720]   And they need to be carefully considered and make sure that, yeah, this is something that
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.960]   she wants and that she has a vision of.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:53.040]   And it's definitely not something you, it needs, I think it's as a husband, it's your
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.280]   job to share a vision and to share what you see as a family, right?
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.120]   And say, hey, here's my proposal, here's why I think it would be a good idea.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:08.040]   But especially in today's world, based upon the situation that she's in, the advice that
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   she'll hear, what her girlfriends will say, et cetera, this is something where she needs
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.960]   to be clear on the benefits and the costs and be sure that this is something that she
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.120]   wants and it's definitely not something that you would force her to do.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.840]   That would be a major mistake.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.360]   >>Trevor: Sure.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.560]   Totally appreciate that.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.840]   And that would change everything if she had a career that she was pursuing and had some
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.080]   kind of 30 year vision of becoming something, but she loves her job.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.920]   She's a professional, she's a pharmacist, she loves what she does.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.680]   She's stated many times that she does not want to be in management.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.040]   She wants to be as sort of a staff type pharmacist, which I think you can go back and get at the
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.080]   end of being a stay at home mom whenever you decide to.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   >>Dave: Yeah.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.640]   And in that case, I've worked with a lot of pharmacists.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.120]   Y'all just want to look and see, is there a way that, is there something where she does,
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.560]   you know, one or two shifts every two weeks where she can keep her connections alive,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:04.880]   keep her head in the game, keep all of her licensing current and make a little bit of
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.080]   money and just have a little chance to be out of the house, a chance to do something
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   different.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:18.840]   I think that's one of the things that is often challenging is simply because, so on, like
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.800]   I'm a stay at home dad, so I'm super in touch and in tune with this stuff because of how
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.600]   involved I am with my children by design.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.280]   Having a job to go to is a wonderful relief from family pressures.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:39.240]   It feels so easy once you have been, it feels so easy to go to work once you've been a full-time
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.720]   father or a full-time mother because it's just an easy thing.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.520]   You go to work, you come into your job, eight hours, 10 hours shift, whatever, you're done
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.720]   and you go.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.480]   And so having a little break from your home life is I think very important.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.120]   And traditionally, this has generally been provided with community.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:03.480]   You have a community where you send your children to school, you have mom can come over and
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.160]   help, you have neighbors, children can go play outside, etc.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:12.600]   One of the things that I think has happened in 2022, meaning just in our current day,
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:19.920]   is that it's actually become more difficult for you to be a full-time parent because the
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.760]   pressure is much more intense.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.360]   And here's what I mean by pressure.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:31.600]   Number one, parents find themselves, at least in my observation, with far less community
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.840]   than was once available.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.040]   And the community that is available is a very structured community.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.600]   So if you went back 100 years and you were a new mother and you had a baby at home, it
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:52.080]   was common that in your block where you lived or in your apartment building or you had neighbors
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.560]   around that also had children.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.400]   But for various reasons, number one, one of which, meaning that we have many fewer children
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.120]   in today's day than we've ever had, is just you don't have that many people in your local
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.800]   area that have children.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.960]   You can go to the suburb somewhere and yeah, there are some children, but there's not,
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.500]   in a row of 15 houses, there aren't five other mothers with babies.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.180]   There might be one other mother and she might have a three-year-old and not a baby.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.320]   So there are just far fewer families, far fewer children.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.640]   And then the places that you meet the children, we don't socialize much on a neighborhood
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.380]   basis or on a close geographic location basis.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:34.200]   So maybe she goes to a mom's group at her church, but now that's drawing moms from all
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.000]   around a 20-square-mile area.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.440]   So if she's going to go and take the children and someone's going to babysit for her so
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.400]   that she can have a little break, she's got to make it a whole affair and a whole event,
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   right?
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.040]   Got to load up the child, make sure we have the bag all packed with everything the baby
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.160]   needs, and then go over to Suzy's house and drop the baby off, and then I got my one hour
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.160]   and go back.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.600]   It's just not the same kind of thing of a break as when there was more of a neighborhood
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.140]   structure where you had other parents with children and they're physically close.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:07.720]   In addition, we have in the modern age adopted very different standards for what is quality
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:13.200]   parenting and what is appropriate parenting versus our forebears.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.560]   So today, my wife and I very rarely are our children out of our sight.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:26.680]   Very rarely are we ever physically apart from them, because we have all kinds of worries,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   right?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.200]   We worry about molesters, we worry about them getting hit by a car, we worry about all this
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.840]   stuff, and we're constantly viewing everyone around us with suspicion.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.440]   "Well, is that person a closet pedophile?
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.200]   Is that person a..."
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.920]   You have all these fears and concerns that previous generations just didn't worry too
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   much about.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.640]   Now, should they have or should they not have?
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.720]   Obviously, they should have worried more in some cases.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.620]   In some cases, we're a little bit overprotective.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:02.000]   But even though I'm into the concept of free-range kids and having your children have opportunities
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.440]   and be tested, but you still are super careful.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.920]   Where let's say you went back a hundred years, a mother may have said, "Kids, get out of
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   here.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   It's two o'clock.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   I don't want to see you until dinner time."
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.640]   And the children go out and they're gone for three hours.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.760]   That today is considered a form of neglect or abuse.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.640]   And so parenting is in some ways a lot more intensive than it once was.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.160]   I don't want to paint a one-sided picture.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.200]   There are many ways in which parenting is much easier than it has been in the past.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.200]   But I do want to acknowledge that these things contribute to make it difficult.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.120]   And these things contribute to making the life of a full-time mother or a full-time
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.280]   father pretty intense.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.400]   And so having a break, having a day or two every two weeks where you go and do some shifts
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.560]   at the pharmacy, if you guys can figure that out with appropriate childcare, with the two
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.080]   of you working together, I think that can actually be something that is a big lifestyle
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.480]   improvement for her where she maintains her sense of professional capacity.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.000]   She maintains her ability to say to others, "Yeah, I'm a pharmacist."
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.320]   She maintains her connections.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.600]   And then if she decides she wants to go back to being a full-time pharmacist in the future,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.200]   it's easier because she's still visible and she's not coming in out of the cold.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.880]   Dr. Tom Hanks Yeah, totally agree.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.000]   I made the same recommendation when we were discussing it the other night.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.440]   You could go on to get a PRN job at a hospital or whatever you want to do just to keep your
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.720]   foot in that world if you want to, but you wouldn't have to.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   It's kind of up to her.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.720]   And the good thing about this is that none of this stuff is—especially with her being
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.240]   a pharmacist, she's highly employable, I would think, and so none of this stuff is
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.520]   permanent, right?
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.040]   If you guys try it out as a family and realize this isn't working for us, you can always
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   make a change.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.600]   It's not hard to get—it's not hard to move it back.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.960]   You don't have to—you don't have to have the next 20 years planned out today.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.120]   Just next year or two and certainly you can afford it.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.760]   If anything, it could be a nice sabbatical for her and an extended maternity break, which
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.240]   I think is a really welcome—really welcome thing.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   Dr. Joshua Seifried No doubt.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   Appreciate it.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yep.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   My pleasure.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   Alright.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   We go to the great state of Utah.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   Welcome to the show.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   How can I serve you today?
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   Dr. Joshua Seifried Hey, Joshua.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.960]   I have a pretty simple question compared to the last couple ones.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.080]   A few weeks ago—well, I guess probably a month and a half ago, we had talked about
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.360]   a Vanguard Lifecycle Fund and some people that were holding it in a non-taxable account
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.840]   and they got stuck with a big tax bill.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:33.000]   And that episode you had mentioned, you thought there were better ways to invest money than
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.560]   a life cycle fund that could provide a little bit more return.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:43.880]   And I'm just curious to see if you'd maybe elaborate on that, on some options other than
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.320]   a life cycle fund for a non-taxable account.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.840]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Sure.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:57.080]   So, at its core, my opinion is simply people overestimate the value of bonds in their portfolio
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   and underestimate the value of stocks.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:09.040]   And life cycle funds generally operate on a principle of significant increases in the
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.840]   percentage of bonds in the portfolio as compared to the percentage of stocks.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.240]   So let's begin—keep it very simple, but let's talk a little bit about modern portfolio
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.480]   theory.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:26.600]   So in modern portfolio theory, the idea is how can we design a portfolio that gives us
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:32.880]   the maximum return based upon certain levels of acceptable volatility.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.240]   Notice I'm using the word volatility.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:41.320]   Usually we'll use the word risk, but by risk we mean volatility, ups and downs in the market
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.360]   and ups and downs in the portfolio.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.640]   From a retirement planning perspective, as we get closer to retirement and as we are
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.160]   in retirement, generally speaking, because we need more money from our portfolio, we're
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.640]   increasingly less willing to accept volatility.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   People get nervous.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.480]   If they've got $2 million to retire on and they got a 25% market drop and all of a sudden
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.520]   they wake up with a million and a half dollars in their portfolio, they get super nervous
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.160]   about that as they should.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:20.120]   And so modern portfolio theory purports to create the most efficient portfolios for every
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.780]   level of accepted volatility.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:30.920]   And so the highest returning portfolio will generally be an all-stock portfolio.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.600]   But the remarkable thing about modern portfolio theory is that they've proven that if you
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:41.640]   just have a little bit of bonds, yeah, maybe, maybe you give up a little bit of total risk—excuse
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:50.040]   me, a little bit of total return, but you gain a big dampening effect with less volatility.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.400]   So a portfolio of 20% bonds and 80% stocks doesn't return that much less than a portfolio
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.800]   of 100% stocks and you get a good dampening effect.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.200]   And then there's the curve, right?
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.360]   The efficient frontier of how much volatility are we willing to accept.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.720]   And you go back to the 60% bonds and a 40% stock portfolio.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.280]   So this is modern portfolio theory and this is what portfolios are built on.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.640]   And that's what a lifecycle fund generally does.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.120]   It says, "Okay, we're going to start you right now with an 80/20 stock to bond ratio
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.780]   and we're going to move you steadily towards a 20/80 bond to stock ratio.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.160]   That way if you're 80 years old, we think that 80% of your money should be in bonds
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.140]   and 20% in stocks."
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.720]   So my complaint about that personally is simply this.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.440]   I don't buy that that's the right move for most people.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.360]   And my arguments are simply these.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:51.600]   Number one, volatility is not generally a problem unless you've done poor financial
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.840]   planning.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:48:00.200]   And so retirement planners are usually facing a constraint that the client says, "How do
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:05.960]   I get the most return out of my portfolio possible because I've just saved barely enough
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.600]   for retirement?
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.920]   And also that income has to be totally stable."
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.880]   That's a hard thing to answer, right?
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.760]   If you say, "Here's $2 million.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:23.280]   I want the maximum income and I'm not willing to accept any ups and downs in my income."
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.600]   You put a planner in a tight spot and the planner is generally going to take a fairly
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:31.320]   conservative approach, develop a conservative portfolio that has the highest probability
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   of returning that stable income.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.380]   But what if you went to the planner and you said, "Yeah, I'm totally willing to change
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:41.360]   my spending from time to time if I had to.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.120]   I just want to have a portfolio that gets as big as possible."
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.440]   Well, you wind up with a different portfolio.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:53.080]   So all of traditional financial planning that creates these portfolios along the efficient
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:49:01.920]   frontier is built upon the mathematical proposition that you have to have stability of income
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:08.320]   and thus you want to maximize the return from the portfolio measured by stability of income.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.040]   That's the underlying assumption.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:18.280]   If you take that assumption out, you could make something different happen.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.880]   And so it's kind of like this, right?
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.920]   Let me use an example.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:29.760]   If you came to me at 60 years old and you said, "Here's $2 million and I need as much
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.680]   income from that money as I can get every single month and I have to have a stable income,"
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.520]   you would get a different portfolio than if you came to me at 60 years old and said, "I'm
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   60 years old.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.160]   I'm never going to spend a dime from this portfolio.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.920]   I want to leave as much money behind to my children and grandchildren as possible."
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.760]   Does that make sense that you would get two different portfolios based on those constraints?
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.320]   Yeah, it does.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   Okay.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.000]   So which of them would create the higher return?
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.960]   Well, almost certainly, again, I have to say almost because we don't know what the future
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:05.240]   and past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance, but almost certainly any
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.040]   analyst who looked at that would say you would have far more money in portfolio B because
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.400]   you just said, "I want as much money as possible when I'm 90 years old."
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.880]   And you would generally in that scenario put the money all in stocks because you don't
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.640]   need the stability.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.920]   You don't need the volatility.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.560]   You need the total return.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.040]   So this brings me to point number two.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.760]   So point number one is the model is constrained by a presupposition.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.280]   The presupposition is I need stable income to last and I need to maximize the income
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.220]   from my portfolio and need it to last for the rest of my life.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.520]   So point number two is this.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:45.960]   I believe that the reason stocks outperform bonds is quite simply that owners get richer
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.760]   than lenders.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:54.400]   Owners of companies get richer than people who lend money to companies.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.920]   And at its core, that's the difference between stocks and bonds.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.200]   Stocks represent ownership in a company and bonds represent lending money to a company.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.000]   Owners get richer than lenders.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.320]   And so while I certainly wouldn't make a forward-looking statement such as stocks always outperform
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:18.160]   bonds because it's not true, meaning we don't know the time period, but on the whole, I
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.280]   don't see how in a long period of time it would ever be possible for a bond portfolio
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.800]   to ever outperform a stock portfolio.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   That's why bonds have lower returns because they're lending money to companies.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   And those are good and useful terms.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Bonds are wonderful, right?
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:41.200]   If you're running an insurance company and you have to mathematically be certain that
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.400]   you can pay the claims of your insureds, then you're going to have a portfolio with a lot
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.760]   of bonds in it because you can get a good return with good stability.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.960]   But I don't want just a good return.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.880]   I want a great return so I can maximize my lifestyle, which leads me to point number
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   three.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:03.760]   I believe that it's better and easier to train an investor to be comfortable with volatility
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:09.280]   than it is to kind of create...
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   What metaphor to use?
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.120]   I want to train an investor to be comfortable with volatility and then make sure that the
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:21.720]   financial plan reflects that rather than indulging the ignorance of the investor.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.160]   Think of it like this.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.760]   Use an airplane example.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.760]   If you...
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:33.000]   Is it better, is it easier for you to build an airplane that will never bounce up and
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.040]   down in the air and the wings will never waggle on it?
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.960]   Or is it easier to simply train somebody to say, "An airplane bouncing up and down in
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:50.000]   the air is not a big deal and the wings are wagging and wiggling because that's how metal
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.560]   works and that's just fundamentally how the physics of metal work."
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.400]   I remember one of the first airplane flights I was on with my dad and I looked out the
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.840]   window and I saw the wings wagging up and down.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.000]   I said, "Dad, isn't that a bad thing that the wings are wagging up and down?"
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.080]   I said, "Joshua, if the wings didn't wag up and down, the whole plane would fall apart
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.880]   because you can't create rigidity, perfect rigidity, and have something strong."
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.880]   The fact that the wings wag, that's just how it works.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.560]   For the rest of my life, it's always been normal.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.760]   I explained to my children what airplane turbulence is.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.000]   It's like we're just hitting waves.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   It's no difference.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.120]   Then when you're on an airplane and the plane is bouncing up and down, it's generally not
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   that big a deal.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.000]   There can be, of course, indications where you drop a thousand feet in an air pocket
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.520]   or something, but it just doesn't matter.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.520]   It's just turbulence.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   The plane is built for it.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.160]   This is how flying works.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:45.880]   It's easier to educate someone about how flying works than it is for you to try to create
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.520]   some totally new technology where they can have a silky smooth flight and not see the
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.200]   wings bouncing up and down.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.080]   In investing, our job is to educate investors to be comfortable with volatility, an appropriate
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:03.240]   amount of volatility based upon their goals, but not to indulge the investor's ignorance
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.800]   and the investor's irrational fears of volatility.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:14.400]   I would rather spend time educating—it's this classic thing with risk profile questionnaires.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.840]   As a financial advisor, the way that you protect yourself from liability and the way the company
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:24.360]   protects itself from liability is to do risk profile questionnaires.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:32.480]   These risk profile questionnaires create a written record that the investor has considered
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.280]   the effects of market conditions on his investments.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.000]   He's telling you, "Here's the kind of portfolio that's suitable for me."
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.160]   While you can push somebody a little bit, generally speaking, at least when I used to
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.320]   give risk profile questionnaires, I just gave them.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.400]   I didn't try to educate someone.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.760]   I need to know what they say.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.720]   But now here you face as a financial planner, let's say the person gives it back and they
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.320]   say, "Yeah, I'm not comfortable with swings in the value of my portfolio."
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.200]   There can be multiple reasons why an investor may not be comfortable with it.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.680]   One reason might be that the investor's budget doesn't allow for swings in a portfolio.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.080]   "I've got $3,000 a month and I've got $3,000 a month of bills, and if I don't
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.800]   have $3,000 a month, I'm going to get kicked out of my house."
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.920]   You can't afford any volatility.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.800]   But then the other thing is just the emotions of the investor.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.960]   It might be the kind of person who's just not comfortable with volatility.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.840]   So let's say that somebody fills out an investor profile questionnaire.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.320]   They hand it back to you as the investment advisor, and you see that they're not comfortable
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.400]   with the swings in the portfolio.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   What do you do?
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   What's the right thing to do?
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.600]   Do you just take them and say, "Yeah, you're not comfortable with turbulence on an airplane,
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.200]   so let's just make sure you don't ever fly."
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:50.240]   Or do you say, "Should I try to educate you to be comfortable with volatility?"
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:55.800]   And that's a really hard thing because I think it's generally the duty of a financial
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.520]   advisor to seek to educate that person to be comfortable with volatility, but that can
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:05.720]   come back to bite you because now you might educate the person into accepting a more volatile
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:11.520]   portfolio, then things go down, they freak out, they sell, and now you screwed up the
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   whole thing.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.880]   So a lot of times you just kind of quietly accept it, and you let the client steer you
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.440]   instead of you steering the client because it just feels easier, and it feels like, "Well,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.800]   I'm listening, and I'm respecting their wishes."
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.200]   Well, my goal is I want to educate the investor to be comfortable with volatility, and then
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.760]   I want to build a financial plan that accounts for it.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.840]   And so if there's no way in the world where you can have somebody with a 50-year investment
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.560]   time horizon, which we'll get to that in a moment, and them not be better off 50 years
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.200]   from now with owning a bunch of stocks versus owning a bunch of bonds.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.160]   Next point, I've got to move faster.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:54.000]   People dramatically underestimate the risk of inflation versus the risk of volatility.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.540]   They underestimate it.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.880]   Inflation is a huge enemy with regard to investing.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.360]   A normal 3% inflation rate is devastating to someone on a fixed income, let alone a
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.700]   9% inflation rate.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.920]   So the only way you can outstrip inflation is to have investments that are significantly
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.340]   outperforming it.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:21.680]   And so I believe that it's more important for an investor to maintain their lifestyle
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.360]   than it is to maintain their portfolio balance.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.400]   You need the lifestyle.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:32.520]   And so over the long time horizon, it's really important that we have a portfolio that's
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.560]   very tilted towards stocks and very non-tilted towards bonds.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:40.720]   Next point, people underestimate their actual time horizon.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.060]   So if you're 50 years old and you're planning a retirement plan, I think you need to plan
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.960]   for a 50-year retirement.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:53.440]   Certainly there's some people who will die at 70, but it's very probable that a significant
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:57.520]   portion of people at 50 today will wind up with a 50-year income.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.240]   And so you need the power of stocks.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:04.200]   And so I'm continually trying to push people more into stocks and less into bonds for these
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   reasons.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:13.600]   So a retirement plan in a static retirement age-date fund that is systematically pushing
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:19.480]   people more and more into bonds is just antithetical to what I think matters.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.400]   And then the final point is this.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.480]   Let's say that you're successful as a financial advisor in getting someone to invest heavily
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.680]   in stocks.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.120]   And let's say that you have enough time for those stocks to do their work.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.720]   Let's say that you get someone into a heavy stock portfolio, say at 55 years old, and
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.200]   then at 75, they're still in a heavy stock portfolio.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.880]   And let's assume that we've had good performance in the stock market.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:48.040]   Well now, the person has far more money than they otherwise would have had if they had
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.440]   gone heavy into bonds to protect the volatility.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.000]   And so now that they're richer, now they can actually afford to take more risk with stocks
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.920]   because they have a much bigger portfolio.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:02.960]   And as long as they don't need to maximize the income from the portfolio, the money can
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.040]   grow more.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.240]   And so now we look at it and say, "Hey, you're 75 years old."
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.960]   But I would have no fear at all.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.720]   Let's say somebody comes and says, "I've got $10 million in a portfolio.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.760]   I spend $100,000 a year."
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.160]   I would keep a 75-year-old, or I would at least want to keep, if it were my dad and
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:26.800]   he was 75 years old in that example, I would tell dad, "Dad, be all in stocks, 100% in
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   stocks."
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:33.280]   Because now I'm thinking about what can the portfolio be worth when you croak at 100 versus
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.000]   what would happen if you went heavily into bonds.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.480]   There's no reason for you to go heavily into bonds.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.400]   If you've got $10 million, you need to spend $100,000 a year.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.840]   The stocks are fine.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:46.360]   And so now you're richer because you took a stock portfolio instead of a bond portfolio.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.520]   You're now richer.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.800]   So now you can afford to deal with more volatility even though you're older and your whole family
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.680]   can benefit from the increasing growth.
[00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:01.200]   So with the exception of somebody who needs a totally stable portfolio so they can maximize
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.280]   their income because they don't have enough money for retirement, I try to get people
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.880]   to move a portfolio more in favor of stocks versus bonds and ignore ever getting to the
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.600]   position where you've got a 60% portfolio in bonds and a 40% portfolio in stocks.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.400]   And then I try to solve with just good, what I call financial planning, meaning make sure
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.760]   you're flexible with your expenses and make sure you have cash on hand and solve the volatility
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.560]   problem with that and then educate the person to be willing to stick through during the
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.920]   difficult times versus the bailing on the portfolio because the market went down 30%.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.720]   So you said you were going to give me an easy question and it's not an easy question for
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.520]   those reasons, but that's why I say there's nothing wrong with a target date retirement
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.960]   fund but I don't like it.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.800]   That's perfect.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.840]   The airplane example is a good example.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.880]   It's easy to understand.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:05.840]   So for someone who has been investing in life cycle funds, how's the best way to go about
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:17.960]   transitioning out of that to get away from a large percentage in bonds?
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.680]   Well, don't do anything because a random guy on the internet tells you to do it.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.060]   That's first of all.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.880]   Make sure that you understand and it's for yourself because it's your money and you care
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.520]   about it more than anyone else's so you need to be more educated on it than anyone else's.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:39.680]   So take what I've said and then do, you know, read a dozen books on investing and see if
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.480]   you still believe what I've said is true after you read a dozen books on investing and portfolio
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.920]   management at whatever level you wish to engage in that.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.020]   Then if you are sure about that, what you do is you sit down and you say, "What is my
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.600]   desired portfolio at this stage in my life?"
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.080]   And you always need to build a portfolio based upon your goals.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.780]   What are my goals for the money?
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.300]   So if this is my 20-year money, you'll have a different portfolio than my three-year money.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.940]   So back to my example.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:15.060]   If you're using a target life cycle fund as a college savings account for your 16-year
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.300]   old, that's not a wrong move.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:24.140]   They do have funds for that but basically the idea is that having volatility with money
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:28.780]   that you definitely need to pay for your 18-year old's college, that's a good time to have
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.340]   money out of stocks.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.300]   So there's a reason why we say don't invest money in stocks that you're going to need
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:37.700]   in the next five years because we can't predict the volatility in the next five years and
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:42.860]   if we have a 30% market drop or a 50% market drop on the college money that you need for
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.340]   your 18-year old, that doesn't work.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:51.140]   So you need to apply your personal financial planning to your portfolio and put names and
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.780]   goals on your different funds.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.860]   Then if you wind up with a portfolio and you say, "Hey, here's a million dollars over here,"
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:03.700]   it's currently invested in a target date retirement fund that currently has a 37% exposure to
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:10.300]   bonds and I think what I'd like to do is actually move to say a 90/10 portfolio.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.900]   Then you simply sell the funds and you move it into new funds that will allow you to have
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.460]   your 90/10 portfolio split.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.340]   Then you need to consider the tax consequences because some of these are in tax advantaged
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.940]   accounts and not.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:29.180]   So you consider the tax consequences and figure out what those costs are and make sure it's
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.540]   still a smart move for you to do.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.260]   Then usually you'll locate your bonds inside of your retirement accounts and you'll locate
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.100]   your stocks outside of your retirement accounts to the extent that you have to locate those
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.700]   assets differently.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.700]   Excellent.
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.700]   That's great.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.700]   That's perfect.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.700]   Good.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   Anything else?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:56.900]   So my wife and I kind of have accounts spread across a handful of things.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:04.060]   My 401k, my wife's 401k and then IRAs.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:10.420]   Is there a good way to kind of keep track of those all together in terms of allocating
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.420]   a portfolio?
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:17.820]   Would you use one account for one specific part of the portfolio and another account
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:25.140]   for another part or would you do an even distribution of parts of the portfolio in each of those
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.700]   accounts?
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:32.140]   If you will put the numbers down on a piece of paper of what accounts you have, how much
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:37.300]   is in them and then you put your goals down of what you want to own, why you want to own
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.940]   it, and then look at them, there's probably a fairly obvious way to set it up.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:48.020]   So that kind of question I can't and I'm not willing to answer in specificity here, but
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:54.740]   it'll probably be apparent to you once you sit down and actually just look at it.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:01.900]   Having two 401ks and two Roth IRAs and two taxable accounts is probably not that big
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:08.860]   of a deal, especially when you're primarily owning mutual funds as you probably are in
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.460]   most of those accounts.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:17.320]   So the key is if you put them down, I am slightly sidestepping your question, but if you just
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.540]   write down your goals it'll probably be obvious.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.700]   Let me just give you one example.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:27.140]   If you said, "You know what, I want to have a portfolio that is, I want to put 80% of
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:36.140]   my money into index stock mutual funds, I want to put 10% of my money into bond index
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:42.060]   funds and I want to put 10% of my money into speculative accounts where I'm going to speculate
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:48.820]   on single stocks and I'm going to speculate on things that I'm interested in."
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:56.380]   Then you look at your portfolio and you've got $300,000 at your primary 401k, you've
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:05.980]   got $200,000 at your secondary 401k, you've got $50,000 in a Roth IRA and you've got another
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.460]   $100,000 in a Roth IRA.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.620]   Well the natural answer would be, and I didn't do my numbers right, I'm making this up on
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:19.220]   the spot, but you would say, "Okay, this $50,000 Roth IRA, this is going to be my speculative
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.220]   account.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.060]   So I'm going to take this to a brokerage company where I can easily speculate, I can play whatever
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.880]   trades I want to play from this account and this is my play money account.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:35.620]   Then we'll go ahead and put our 10% of bond allocation into our secondary 401k because
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.060]   they've got a good bond fund available to us and then the balance we'll put in stock
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.560]   mutual funds across the other three accounts."
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.900]   So if you lay out your goals of what accounts you want and why and what your goal is for
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:51.980]   that account and then you look at what the options are that are available to you, it
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:52.980]   should be obvious.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:59.140]   It's obvious that you're not going to speculate in your 401k because generally you're not
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.420]   going to have access to single stocks.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.380]   You're going to want that just to be one of your mutual fund accounts where they have
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:08.380]   a good fund, "Hey, here's a good index mutual fund."
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.740]   Whereas you put your speculation inside of your individual brokerage account or your
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.780]   Roth IRA with the brokerage where you can do the kinds of trades that you want.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:23.880]   So just put it on paper, write out your goals, put out your macro allocation and then meaning
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.320]   I want 5% of my money in gold, I want 5% of my money in Bitcoin, I want 10% of my money
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.500]   in bonds and I want 80% of my money in stocks.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:36.020]   Whatever your macro allocation is, then look at your more detailed allocation.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.420]   If I want to do stocks, do I need to follow a more diversified plan?
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:43.600]   Do I want to put a total stock market index fund?
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.980]   Do I want to have a certain portion in the United States versus other countries?
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.340]   And then follow whatever goal you lay out and look at the accounts through the lens
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.340]   of your goals.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.340]   >>Joshua: Excellent.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.340]   That's great advice.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.340]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.340]   I appreciate your time.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   >>Trevor: My pleasure.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:06.300]   Have a wonderful day and I believe that brings us to the last phone call of today.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.820]   I'll just give you kind of my closing discussion here.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:18.020]   Obviously that same advice applies to any of us, meaning that the definition for what
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:22.260]   you should do with your money always is going to come down to your goals.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.260]   Those goals need to be personal.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.200]   So a goal of beating the market is irrelevant.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.580]   A goal of having a certain amount of money to retire is relevant.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:38.220]   And I should have said this when I was answering the question, but there are reasons to minimize
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.680]   volatility.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.940]   So there are good reasons where someone might say, "I don't want to take any volatility
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.180]   because maybe I don't need it."
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:50.960]   The same person with the $10 million and the $100,000 income, that person might not have
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:57.020]   any desire for the money, in which case minimizing the volatility might be a useful thing.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:01.580]   I don't think that a bond portfolio is by definition safer than a stock portfolio, at
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.820]   least a well-diversified stock portfolio, which is why I'm avoiding using the words
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:08.140]   risk and safe.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.780]   I think it's just simply less volatile.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:18.140]   And bonds have their own sets of safety risks, and so you have to be more precise and defined.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.980]   But the key is always going to be your goals.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:26.220]   And if you're wondering what to do with your money, the answer is usually, in my experience,
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.980]   clarify your goals.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:33.320]   And if you'll make your goals clear, say, "This is my goal," and then put those goals
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.820]   on a piece of paper in front of you, and then look at your balance sheet, then, or your
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.660]   income statement, or whatever it is that your financial document you're looking at, then
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:47.140]   if you compare your goals to your money, the answer to your money question will usually
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.540]   be obvious.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.380]   If somebody doesn't know what to do with their money, I don't spend a lot of time talking
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.060]   about what they could do.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.220]   I try to focus on what their goals are.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:01.420]   And if your goals are clear, then generally the next steps are fairly obvious.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:06.940]   And that applies on the macro level, and it also applies on the specific account location
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:11.340]   level or type of particular assets that I want to invest in.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:15.980]   So if you're wondering about something, get clear on your goals, and then go back and
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.980]   tackle your financial question.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   Thank you for listening.

[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060]   Finance.

[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.060]   And now, an Etsy holiday gifting mission.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.380]   Today's episode, Operation Delivered on Time.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.380]   Here's the situation.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:38.540]   The holidays are coming up, which means you're on a mission to buy handcrafted gifts, and
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.220]   they have to be delivered on time.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.820]   Failure is not an option.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.940]   You need a guarantee that everything will get to its destination.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.300]   Impossible, right?
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:49.460]   Not this year, because you're shopping for gifts on Etsy.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.300]   Etsy is where everyone can find handmade gifts from independent sellers and get them delivered
