[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.980]   Pastor John, here's a question from Michael in St. Paul. He asks, "What is
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.000]   the Christians' responsibility to creation?" And I'll add another
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.880]   common question into this discussion. If the Apostle Peter says that this world
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.680]   is going to burn up, why should Christians care at all about creation today?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   I like the question, and I've been tempted more than once, and several
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.240]   people have asked me to write a short book on creation care. Maybe I'll do it
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   someday, but here's what I would say in essence. There are different approaches
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.560]   for justifying serious concern and care for creation and not treating it as trash
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:55.280]   and doing things with it and for it that make it what God wants it to be. And one
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:05.200]   is to approach Genesis 1, where we're created to be fruitful and multiply
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.880]   and fill the earth and subdue it and bring it under dominion. So the whole
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   theology of dominion--man has dominion over the earth, and that would mean he's
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.520]   a steward of it. He should govern it and control it and use it for good
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.960]   purposes. And so God's given him a responsibility right in the very
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   beginning of the Bible not to misuse, but to care for. A second approach would be
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520]   that God delights in the earth. He made nature, and you've got these Psalms like
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   Psalm 104, where he--you made Leviathan to play in the ocean. It's as if God
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   simply delighted in the beauty of creation and all of its infinite variety
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.000]   and wisdom you have made them all. And if God has created it in beauty and delights
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   in it, who are we not to delight in it and not to care for it? And that's
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.560]   the second way. The third way is the way I function. All those are valid, but
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.200]   they don't answer the essential bottom-line question for me. If you ask
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.160]   me, "Why do you recycle?" Which we do. "Why do you want a smaller carbon footprint?"
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.240]   Which we do. "Why do you buy a non-gas guzzling car? Why do you make little
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.640]   efforts to try to be active in creation care?" And the answer is, "Love
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   your neighbor as yourself." The person who says, quoting Peter, "This is all gonna
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.600]   burn up, so why should we care for it?" It's like a person who says, "My house is
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.480]   gonna burn down in 30 years, so I'm not gonna paint it tomorrow." I mean, it's not
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.440]   loving towards your kids. If you'd like your kids to have this house, or if you're
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   gonna sell the house and give some money to the church, to your kids, or whatever,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.920]   you don't let the final destruction of your house someday keep you
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.080]   from taking care of it now so that you can enjoy it, and they can enjoy it, or
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.600]   you could sell it for a good price and give the money to a good cause. That's
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   just nonsense. And so it is with the world. I think it's better to emphasize
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   not that the world's going to be burned up, but the world's going to be remade. I
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.880]   think that passage in 2 Peter does not mean burning to destruction, but
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.400]   burning in refinement, and that the new heavens and the new earth are in
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.720]   continuity with this heaven and this earth, and that we will know our precious
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.120]   planet in the new heavens and the new earth. But see, that kind of argument for
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.080]   why we should take care of it just doesn't cut it with most people, and
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.760]   doesn't with me either. What really cuts it with me is, do you love people? Do you
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.040]   love the people that are going to drink the water that you're pouring the
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.360]   garbage into the river of? Do you love the people that are going to not have...
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.480]   I'm thinking of Kenya right now, and we have good friends who are in creation
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.960]   care in Kenya, and they bemoan the deforestation and the slash-and-burn
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.120]   approach towards farming that is ruining all kinds of futures for people. It's a
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.720]   beautiful land. It would work if they could learn how to manage the farming so
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.760]   that the land is not destroyed for the coming generations. That's just pure love
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.640]   your neighbor as you love yourself. How big of a tragedy is it for someone to
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.280]   care for creation, to protect wildlife, to protect a forest, but not to see the
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.520]   beauty of God in that creation? I mean, how big of a tragedy is that, to seek to
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.400]   care for creation but not to see the divine beauty through it? For them
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.000]   personally, it's an infinite tragedy, because if you don't know God, you lose
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.160]   everything. For the world, God will turn that for good. I mean, if they preserve
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   parks, and if they preserve clean water, and if they preserve natural habitats,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.200]   many people are going to benefit the way, hopefully, they ought to benefit. But
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.480]   for the person who is engaged in that, or any other good deed for that matter,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.520]   without doing it for Christ's sake, is a great tragedy, because God made us to do
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.600]   everything we do for his glory, and in dependence on his power, and in love for
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.000]   his Son, and when we try to do right things without any dependence on Christ
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.760]   or for Christ's glory, we are contradicting the very reason for which
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.440]   we're made. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
