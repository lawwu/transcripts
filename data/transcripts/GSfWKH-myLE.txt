[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Most of you will remember that we are at the moment considering verses 9 and 10 in the
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.160]   tenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.920]   heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.480]   For with the heart men believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   salvation.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:44.320]   Now, here we are looking at what we have described as Paul's definition of saving faith.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.720]   It's a most important statement.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   It is really the point at which he sums up this whole argument with respect to the Jews
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.120]   who are outside salvation because they have not sought it by faith but after the deeds
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.300]   of the law.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.640]   It is one of the great summaries of this doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.480]   And it is, as I say, a very wonderful summary at the same time of what is meant by saving
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480]   faith.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.100]   And I have suggested that it can be divided in a threefold manner.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.520]   First of all, the content of saving faith.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.920]   Then the character of saving faith.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.360]   And thirdly, the proof of saving faith.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.800]   Now we have been so far looking at the first heading, the content of saving faith.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.840]   Two divisions.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.880]   The Lord Jesus, or that Jesus is Lord, and secondly, that God hath raised him from the
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880]   dead.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.840]   But the point we have been trying to establish is this, that we must be careful to observe
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.400]   the content of those two statements.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   That they are not merely some kind of clichÃ©s or statements in and of themselves, and that
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.360]   all we have to do is to confess with our mouth that we believe that Jesus is Lord and believe
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.200]   in our hearts that God hath raised him from the dead.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880]   And that we simply make those two statements and that all is well that we are saved.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.720]   We have been trying to show that there is a deep and a great content to these statements.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.400]   And we have been working them out in all their fullness, both of them.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.800]   We have seen that there are certain implications to the two statements that are very vital
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   and very essential.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.360]   And at the end, last Friday night, having drawn out the content of the two statements,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   I asked a question.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.280]   And the question I put was this, was there anybody present who felt that I had been reading
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.360]   too much into this, that I had been making it too involved and too difficult?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.040]   I asked whether there was somebody who really did believe that all a man had got to do was
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840]   to say, "Yes, I believe that Jesus is Lord and I believe that God has raised him from
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.640]   the dead and that he is immediately saved."
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.760]   That he needn't know anything more than that.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.840]   And that that is the content of saving faith, the bare statements, without the deductions
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.360]   which we had been drawing.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.640]   Well, I answered my own question by saying that if anybody did think that, that my reply
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   to them was to be found in the last two verses of the first chapter of Paul's first epistle
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   to the Thessalonians.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.960]   Now, there is the first epistle that the apostle ever wrote, at Laetitia, that's generally
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   agreed.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.560]   And the apostle there gives a very wonderful summary of what he had preached to them.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.400]   He says that everybody knows what he had preached in Thessalonica.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.720]   They themselves sure of us.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.680]   That's to say these people round about in Macedonia and Achaia who had heard of what
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.560]   had happened in Thessalonica.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.040]   They themselves sure of us what manner of entering in we had unto you.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.400]   And how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.760]   son from heaven whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   to come.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.840]   Now, there is an elaboration of what you get in Romans 10 9.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.160]   That is what the apostle preached.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.280]   And when he says that those who confess with the mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in their
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.360]   hearts that God has raised him from the dead, it includes these other things which we find
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.000]   here, especially in 1 Thessalonians 1 10.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.820]   Now I had thought and I had hoped that that perhaps would be sufficient.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.760]   I raised the question because, of course, I am familiar with the fact that there are
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.540]   many people who would quite seriously have thought that I had been putting too much content
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.960]   into this statement in Romans 10 9.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.720]   And that was why I raised the question at all.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.400]   And I thought that by quoting 1 Thessalonians 1 9 and 10 that I really had disposed of it.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.160]   But I am afraid I must come back to it again.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.640]   Because at the close of the meeting last Friday night, I had the pleasure and the privilege
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:45.720]   of a visit from a Christian lawyer who comes from Ceylon, and a most intelligent man who
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.520]   had been particularly interested by that last point of mine, the way I had raised that question
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.680]   and had answered it.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:02.960]   But he said, "You know, I am not completely satisfied that you are right in your attitude.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   Aren't you putting too much into the content of the evangel?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:15.680]   Aren't you putting too much content into this first simple Christian profession?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.360]   This thing which decides whether a man is a Christian or not?"
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   He said, "You know, as you were speaking, I couldn't help thinking of the Philippian
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   jailer."
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.000]   I said, "Quite right.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.520]   Well, now, what were you thinking?"
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.280]   "Well," he said, "I remember that when the Philippian jailer came to Paul and Silas
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.720]   and put his famous question, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:48.240]   The answer was, they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.600]   and thy house.'"
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   And that was all.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.000]   Whereupon, of course, I smiled at him.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.920]   I have told you that he was a lawyer and a man, therefore, who knows how to present a
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.520]   case and how to argue.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.360]   But I did have the pleasure of pointing out to him that a lawyer, in addition to having
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.280]   an ability as a debater, should also have facts, and that facts are much more important
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.720]   than debating ability.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.520]   He enjoyed all this, I may say.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.000]   I said, "The trouble is, you know," I said, "you really don't know your scriptures well
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   enough."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.360]   And he was quite amazed at this.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.280]   But he said, "Surely that was all.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.240]   That was all they said to him.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.800]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.640]   And is any more than that necessary?"
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.800]   I do wonder, he said, "Whether, in answer to your own question, which you so rightly
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.560]   raised, you haven't been putting too much in it."
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.440]   I said, "Now then, the answer to you is this.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.640]   It's in the verse that follows the verse that you've just quoted out of Acts 16."
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   He said, "What's that?"
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   I said, "Well, let's have a look."
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.360]   And so I read it to him.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   And here it is.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.880]   He had quoted Acts 16, 31.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   And they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house,"
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:15.360]   verse 32, "and they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.280]   In other words, they told him what they meant by "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   They preached the gospel to him.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.960]   They told him all that Paul habitually did, as we see in 1 Thessalonians 1, 9, and 10.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.160]   They gave him this doctrine that I've been putting before you, as we've been drawing
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.140]   out the implications of these two summaries of the Christian faith.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.440]   They spake the word of the Lord to him.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.400]   And of course, intelligent Christian men that he was, he was profoundly grateful to me.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160]   He said, "I hadn't noticed that."
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   Of course.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.120]   Well, now that is exactly the trouble.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.600]   And it is because of that that I feel constrained to come back again to this tonight, because
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.920]   I believe there is a great deal of misunderstanding with regard to this very matter at this moment.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.440]   Indeed, I believe that it is responsible for many of our troubles in the Christian church.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   I am sure it is responsible for most of the troubles amongst evangelical people, who seem
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:23.120]   to me at the present time to be tending to listen far too readily to the ecumenical talk
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.880]   and various other types of teaching.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   It is all due, I think, to this initial failure.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.360]   So I come back to it once more.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.160]   Well, now, let me put it to you like this.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.100]   There are two main dangers, it seems to me, that arise over this question of the content
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.560]   of saving faith.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.320]   And I want to talk about both of them.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.840]   Now incidentally, let me say this.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.060]   This is my idea of biblical teaching.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.440]   It includes application.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.200]   You don't rush through the scriptures giving headings and you say, "I've done the Epistle
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.800]   to the Romans, I know all about it."
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.200]   No, no, you don't know it until you really have explored it and know its meaning and
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.400]   have applied it.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.040]   And it is because of this application, as I said, that I am coming back to this.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.280]   Now the two dangers are, of course, as is invariably the case with any study of the
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.520]   scripture, two extremes.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.080]   The danger, the commoner danger today, I think, is the danger of putting too little into the
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   content.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.380]   That's what I've been trying to counteract the last three or four Friday evenings.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.120]   Too little content.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.760]   Then the second danger is the danger of putting too much into it.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.360]   And they're both at extremes, and I want to try to show that they're both wrong.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.880]   We mustn't put too little in, we mustn't put too much in.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.520]   Now then, let's take them in order.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.000]   The danger of putting too little content.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.680]   Now let me give you another illustration of what I mean.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.480]   Take that thirteenth verse of Acts 16.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:06.600]   Paul at Philippi, the famous scene, how he went out on the Sunday afternoon to the riverside
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.320]   outside the walls of the city, where he knew that a prayer meeting was held, and there
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.640]   he found a number of women praying.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.560]   And verse 13 reads, "On the Sabbath we went out of the city by a riverside where prayer
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.640]   was wont to be made, and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither."
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:32.560]   Now a contemporary, present-day, well-known evangelical scholarly commentator makes this
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.000]   comment on that.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.680]   "They sat down among the women and told them the story of Jesus."
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.000]   Now that's a perfect illustration, I think, of putting in too little content.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.760]   They sat down among the women and told them the story of Jesus.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.080]   To which the answer is, of course they did, but they didn't stop at that.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.120]   They didn't stop at telling the story of Jesus.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.040]   Now then, this is the whole point.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.400]   On what grounds do I say that?
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.360]   Well, I say that on the grounds of the teaching of the book of the Acts of the Apostles itself.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.560]   Apostolic preaching did give the facts, but it never stopped at the mere recital of facts.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:26.160]   It always went on to give the meaning of the facts, the significance of the facts.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   Take Peter in his first sermon on the day of Pentecost.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.040]   He of course is concerned primarily with the great fact of the resurrection.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.560]   But watch how he draws out the significance, the meaning.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.040]   And how he says this wasn't true of David.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.460]   David's been dead and buried and we've got his sepulchre.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.200]   This proves that he is who he is, and therefore it's in him salvation is to be found.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.320]   Therefore repent and be baptized in his name, and so on and so forth.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.480]   And so it is with all the other speeches and reports of sermons that we have in the book
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.880]   of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.840]   They did tell the story of Jesus, but they never stopped at that.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.280]   Their whole point was to show the significance of this.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   The story of Jesus leads to this, that God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.200]   That this is the Messiah who fulfills all the prophecies, and how he has done so.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.840]   So you see, you get this rich content.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.360]   It's no use saying to a man, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.120]   The man says, "Who is Jesus Christ?
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.640]   What does believing in Jesus Christ mean?"
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.880]   Now you see, this is where all this becomes so important.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.080]   And as you go through the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you always see, I say that
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.520]   you've got fact plus meaning and significance.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.700]   They always interpreted it and they pressed it home.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.960]   And then they made their great call to repentance.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.240]   But you get it not only in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, you get it as I've
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.360]   already quoted in that little summary there at the end of 1 Thessalonians 1, and then
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.920]   you get it in that wonderful summary at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720]   "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you."
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.880]   This was what he preached.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.520]   "Which you also have received and wherein you stand, by which also you are saved, if
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.920]   you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.360]   For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.960]   for our sins."
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.040]   He didn't merely tell the story of Jesus and say that he was crucified and died and
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.480]   was buried and rose again.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.600]   He died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.040]   And that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.000]   and that he was seen of Cephas and the rest.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.320]   And then he works out this great argument about the resurrection and why it is absolutely
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.880]   essential that we should believe in it.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.040]   Now, but that is what he says he preached at the beginning.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Christ died for our sins.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.200]   That's why Paul preached Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.280]   It was always this meaning in addition.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.760]   So you get it put in 2 Corinthians 5, 21.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.320]   He says that as preachers the apostles were ambassadors.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.160]   And what is the business of the ambassador?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.280]   Well the business of the ambassador is this.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:33.480]   He says, "To proclaim a message to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.360]   himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us this word
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.520]   of reconciliation.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.320]   Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.080]   in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.880]   knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.800]   Now that was apostolic preaching.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.200]   There's no question about it.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.800]   They didn't merely tell the story of Jesus.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.040]   They showed the meaning of it all and that is what we've been trying to do on these Friday
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:14.480]   evenings so that once more I would remind you of this all important point.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.440]   And it is something which we must never forget as we read the scriptures and particularly
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.880]   a book like the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.580]   What you have there is not a complete and exhaustive account.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.640]   It isn't a shorthand note of every word uttered by the preacher.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   It isn't a tape recording.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.400]   They haven't got them and even if they had it wouldn't be a full report.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   These are just summaries.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:48.320]   They are nothing but summaries, synopses in the briefest possible form.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.480]   And our business therefore is to realize that and to realize something of the fullness of
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   the content.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.120]   Now why is all this so important?
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.320]   Well now I think it's important and especially today for many reasons.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.040]   Here are some of them.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.480]   We are living in a day when there is a great emphasis on evangelism.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.440]   And let's be quite blunt and plain and clear about it.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:21.960]   We are living in days when people are tremendously interested in decisions and pressure is brought
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.840]   to get decisions.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.040]   Now it's just at that point all this becomes important.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.680]   Men and women must know what they're deciding about.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.680]   Why they're deciding.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.080]   Why they should decide.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:43.560]   Now the danger is I say that in the anxiety to bring people to salvation that too small
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.300]   a content may be given.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.520]   And that if people merely say yes to something that is said to them that all is well.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.760]   I'm just trying to show that that is not how the apostles evangelized.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   That there was a much bigger content.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   Very often you will find today that the preaching may be very general.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.680]   I've been in such meetings myself when I would have said the gospel was not preached.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.460]   Nevertheless an appeal was made at the end and people came forward.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.020]   But did they know what they were doing?
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.420]   Now these are the dangers which confront us at a time like this.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.960]   That men and women may think that a mere subscription to a formula saves them.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.240]   Merely going forward saves them according to some.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.760]   And many people think that having gone forward that they're inevitably and automatically
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   saved.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.320]   Though they don't know what they believe they don't know exactly what they're doing.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   That's one danger but there's another.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.480]   We're living in a time of trouble.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.160]   And many people are unhappy.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.400]   There are many problems.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.360]   Many people have got many problems.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   Some can't sleep.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Some are worried.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.600]   Some are worried about their health and they can't get any help.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.520]   The world is full of problems.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   And people like that go to a Christian service and they're told come to Jesus and you'll
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.640]   get all that you require.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.120]   And they require so much and they come hoping that they're going to get this thing that
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   they want.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.640]   Now if you merely say to those people confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.720]   in your heart that God has raised him from the dead I say you are misleading them.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.120]   If you merely say to them believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and they shall be saved and then
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.080]   say do you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ they say yes you're saved you're misleading
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.380]   them.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.440]   It is our business to make quite certain that they know what they're believing.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.120]   We must speak the word of the Lord to them the word of God as Paul and Silas did to that
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.160]   Philippian jailer and to his household.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.920]   We must draw this thing out we must expound it.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   They must know it.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.220]   They don't merely believe the story of Jesus.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.080]   They must know the significance of the story.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.360]   In other words and this is where the danger comes in so often.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.200]   It is our business to show such people that their need is not really what they think it
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.880]   is.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.040]   People say I want happiness but really what they need is not happiness they need to be
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.480]   reconciled to God.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.800]   Our business is to show them the cause of their unhappiness.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.920]   We don't medicate symptoms lightly.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.760]   We don't say come to Christ and you'll be happy.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.200]   No no we've got to show them that they've never realized their fundamental need namely
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.320]   that they're estranged from God.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   Their under is wrath.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.240]   Whether they're happy or miserable it doesn't matter at that point.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   The fact is this is true of everybody.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   We've got to direct them to their real need and show them how it is what God has done
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.040]   in the Lord Jesus Christ alone that can possibly deal with them.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.840]   Now then we're in an age which is subjective.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.880]   We start with ourselves and we end with ourselves and we want something and we're told very
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.600]   well here it is it's in Christ for you.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.640]   But if we don't explain the way of salvation and show them their condition under the law
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.400]   we are not doing what the apostles did.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.240]   And indeed we are not putting sufficient content into our presentation of the gospel.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.800]   So let me give you some further reasons why what I've been doing the last few Friday
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.080]   nights is so essential.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.320]   Now one further reason is this.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.200]   That this is the way in which the New Testament itself describes salvation.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.240]   Salvation is coming to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.720]   Look at it in 1 Timothy 2 in verse 3 and following.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.440]   For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.920]   be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.840]   For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus who gave
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.000]   himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time where unto I am ordained a preacher
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.440]   and an apostle, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.480]   It is a knowledge of the truth and we must keep that in the forefront and therefore we
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   must be clear about the content of that truth.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.260]   It isn't merely the story of Jesus.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:25.800]   It is the explanation, the meaning of it, the significance of it which we've been trying
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   to expand.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.640]   So there's a further reason but here's another one.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:38.680]   If we don't take this trouble to put the right content into this belief and declaration,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:46.220]   well then we will have no standard whereby to measure our experience.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.720]   Now this is another very important point.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.280]   Experience is essential.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.000]   You can't be a Christian as I'm going to show you later without having experience.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.120]   You experience the truth.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.640]   You've got to believe in your heart.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.760]   It is with the heart that men believeth unto righteousness.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   Very well.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.440]   But now the danger is that people say that any sort of experience is alright.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.840]   And they say what's it matter whether I understand or not, what's it matter what I believe?
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.320]   All I know is I've got an experience whereas I was once blind, now I see.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.280]   I used to be miserable, now I'm happy.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280]   Here it is.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   I've got what I wanted.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:27.400]   But of course the answer to that is quite simple.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.960]   The Bible tells us that there are many spirits that have gone forth.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.180]   There are many counterfeits of the truth.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:41.580]   There is an enemy, the devil, who is most subtle and he can simulate the Christian experience
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.720]   almost exactly.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.440]   He can give people experiences.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.120]   He's got the power to do it.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.160]   So that if you're going to base your whole position solely upon some experience, how
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.980]   do you know you've got the true experience?
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.400]   You see, this is where the church I feel has broken down.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:08.660]   I remember very well being at a conference of ministers in 1935 and this whole matter
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   came up.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.920]   I'm not sure whether I've told you this or not.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.960]   It's important and therefore I repeat it even if I have said it.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.020]   We were having a discussion at the close of the first day and people were, there were
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.920]   critics present of the Bible and so on.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.240]   And some men were giving this answer and this alone.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.680]   Say what you like, they said, you can't affect my experience.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.000]   I've got what I've got and you can't touch it.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.800]   Now that's to me a highly dangerous position to be in.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.720]   It's unintelligent to start with.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.360]   It's utterly unscriptural.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.160]   No, no.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.200]   What we want to know is what gives you your experience.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.560]   And if the experience isn't the result of this truth, it is a counterfeit experience.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.440]   It is a false experience.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.400]   It's a very dangerous experience.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:03.440]   There are books in which you can read how men have undergone profound changes.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.800]   I remember reading a most fascinating book, it must have been before this last war, the
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.280]   last war, in which a number of men were writing on sort of turning points in their life.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:19.840]   And it was an astounding book because some of them had undergone a very profound change.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.760]   I remember one man who had been a hopeless, brunkard, poor fellow, a professional man
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.560]   and a very able man, but had become a helpless dipsomaniac.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.200]   And that man, to cut his story short, came to this, that one morning after a terrible
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.280]   night, he got up and happened to look at himself in a mirror, and he was so shocked at the
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.080]   sight he saw, he never drank another drop.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.880]   He became an entirely different man.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.680]   Well, now that was a wonderful experience.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.640]   And others were saying similar things.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   No, no.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.800]   What we are concerned about is this, what leads to the experience.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.480]   The power of Satan at counterfeit and camouflage is almost endless.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.200]   So much so that he can almost deceive the very elect.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.600]   He can perform line wonders, he can produce miracles, he can give signs.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   Now that's New Testament teaching.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.000]   So we must have objective truth to test all experience by.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.320]   There's another reason.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.840]   But here's another one, and this is so important at the present time.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:30.240]   How do you test the various teachings that are put before you?
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.920]   Satan knocks at your door and you go there.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.240]   And there he is selling books.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   And he says that he believes the Bible, he's got the message of the Bible, and here are
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.960]   books which will help you to understand the Bible.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.080]   Nice man to look at, talks in a nice way, very polite.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   He's called and taken the trouble.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.960]   He's not playing football on Saturday afternoon, nor sitting in the cinema, nor lounging at
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.720]   home looking at the television.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.240]   He's so concerned about you and you're coming to a knowledge of the truth, he's given up
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.920]   his Saturday afternoon.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.160]   And here he is out in the rain in order to help you.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.580]   How do you test his teaching?
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.080]   If all you've got is the story of Jesus, or if all you know is this, "Well I went to a
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.240]   meeting and I felt something, and I was told, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   shalt be saved.'
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.320]   And I was asked, 'Do you believe?'
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.120]   I said, 'Yes, I was told you are saved.'
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.560]   But then you say, 'Well what do you mean by that?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   How does he?'
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560]   'Well I don't know.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.800]   All I was told was, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.'
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.600]   That's all I know, and I felt very happy ever since, and I go to meetings and I'm enjoying
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   myself.'
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.720]   'But ah,' says this man, 'you know you really haven't got it properly.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.320]   There's so much you know that they haven't told you, and out he brings all this wonderful
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   teaching.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.040]   How do you answer him?'
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.480]   You see, if we haven't got a content to what we believe, if there isn't a full content
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.680]   to our faith, if we don't know why we believe and what we believe and how, well then I say,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.640]   we've got nothing whereby to test these false teachings that are rounded about us at the
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.480]   present time.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.280]   There is nothing that I know of that is more dangerous than the attitude that says, 'Doesn't
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.320]   matter what you believe, as long as you somehow believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.360]   You needn't bother about the doctrine or the theology or the understanding of it all.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.000]   As long as you felt something and you want to be a Christian and to live a good life
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and to help others, all is well.'
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.880]   Now there's nothing more dangerous than that.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.920]   You've got no answer to these other people.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.280]   But how do you answer the suggestion that is made so often today that all the religions
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.760]   of the world should come together?
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.160]   There's a world congress of religions and we are told they've all got their insights,
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.120]   there are many ways to get to the top of the mountain of God, Christianity is one of them,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.000]   very valuable, but Buddhism, Confucianism, Mohammedanism, they've all got some Hinduism,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.360]   they've all got an insight and something to teach.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.280]   What's it matter as long as we all believe in the same God and are out to serve him?
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.320]   No, how do you answer that?
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.720]   Unless you know the content of this.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   It isn't enough just to believe that Jesus is the son of God and that he rose from the
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   dead.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.760]   You've got to believe much more than that before you can answer these people.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.240]   You've got to work it out, you've got to have an understanding of the doctrine.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:15.320]   Now the Apostle Peter tells us in his second epistle and in the third verse something that
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.000]   I think this present generation of Christians needs to take to heart very seriously.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.160]   He is referring to the epistles of the Apostle Paul in the 15th verse.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.520]   "And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our beloved brother
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.160]   Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you, as also in all
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.720]   his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.520]   which they that are unlearned and unstable rest."
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.240]   What makes them unstable is that they are unlearned, and then they rest, as they do
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.720]   also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:05.080]   The Apostle reminds the Ephesians that we be henceforth no more children tossed to and
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.840]   fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.800]   wherein they lie in wait to deceive.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.880]   Children are ignorant, they don't know the content, that's why they can be misled and
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.160]   carried away.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.680]   The answer is to know the content of what you believe.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:31.760]   Very well then, without this understanding of the fullness of the content, we shall find
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   ourselves unable to assess these other teachings that are round and about us at the present
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.680]   time, other teachings produced even in the name of the Christian Church.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.920]   How do you evaluate them?
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.520]   Do you just say, "Ah, but this man's a bishop, therefore, must be right."
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.200]   Is that your position?
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.360]   But how do you turn him down?
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.280]   It isn't enough to say, "I don't agree with him."
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.440]   You must prove that he's wrong.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.160]   You must show that he's wrong if you want to help young people who are round and about
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.640]   you, who are hearing these things and perhaps are attracted by them because they sound a
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.040]   bit rebellious and they sound as if they were new.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.280]   How do we help such people?
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.840]   We can't do so unless we know the content.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.480]   But then here's another very important reason for doing what we've been doing.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:23.800]   It is the only way to enjoy a full assurance of salvation.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   Now if you've been content with just believing the story of Jesus, or just saying mechanically,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.520]   "Yes, I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and believe that therefore I'm saved because
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:41.800]   I say that," what happens when you suddenly pass through a very dry period of the story
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.520]   of the soul?
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.040]   What happens when you're attacked by the devil and he makes assaults upon you and makes you
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.080]   feel vile and foul and wretched and hopeless and damned?
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.440]   How do you answer that?
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.600]   You can't answer that.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.960]   There's only one way to answer the devil, and that is to know the truth as it is in
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.440]   Christ Jesus.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.320]   "Whom resist, steadfast in the faith," says Peter.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.040]   And without the faith you can't do it, but with the faith you can do it.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.320]   You know that you believe in one who has already conquered the devil when he was here in this
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.960]   world and is still living and able to help you and all others who are attacked in the
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:31.000]   way that he was attacked himself when he was here in this world of time.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.360]   Without an understanding of the content, you will find that your assurance will soon go.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.680]   And all right, perhaps, for a while, and when you're able to go to meetings, what happens
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   when you lose your health?
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.020]   What happens if death visits the family?
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.220]   What happens if you get trouble in your work?
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.900]   One is constantly having to deal with such people.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.880]   They seem to be so happy, suddenly they lose everything.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   Why?
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.320]   "Well," they said, "it hasn't turned out as I thought it would."
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.680]   They thought, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, all is going to be well," but it isn't all
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   well.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.720]   They're tempted, they're tried, they've got troubles and tribulations, and their whole
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.080]   foundation seems to have gone.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.720]   They didn't know the content of what they believed.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.640]   No, no, my friends, you will never have a true assurance unless you have this fullness
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.760]   of content.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.640]   And lastly, this is the only way in which you'll ever be able to help anybody else.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:30.160]   The Apostle Peter again puts it very wonderfully in 1 Peter 3.15, "Sanctify the Lord God in
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:38.200]   your heart and be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.120]   You see, it's not enough for you to say to somebody, "You know, I used to be miserable
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   and unhappy.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.200]   I went to a meeting, I felt something, I went forward, they said, 'Do you believe in the
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   Lord Jesus Christ?'
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.280]   I said, 'Yes, write yourself.'"
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.000]   That doesn't help the other person, who may ask you questions.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.480]   If you can't answer the questions, you can't help him.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.920]   You've got to be able to give reasons for the hope that is in you.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.840]   You've not only got to know the story of Jesus, but the significance.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.680]   And you've got to be able to work it out.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.720]   You've got to present the position to them.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.280]   You've got to show them why they are what they are, how the Bible shows it's because
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.760]   of the fall and sin, and how they can never put themselves right, but that Christ came
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760]   for their praise.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.440]   You've got to expound the way of salvation.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.760]   You can't help another if you don't know the way of salvation in detail yourself.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   It is a sure impossibility.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:38.000]   Therefore it is, I say, vital that in addition to repeating the slogans, as it were, we are
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.600]   able to expound them, draw out their meaning, show their full significance.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.840]   Now then, there's the one side.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.280]   The danger of too little content.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   But now let me turn for a moment to the second.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.640]   The danger of too much content.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.920]   The danger of putting too much into it, reading too much into it.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.540]   Now you see, I raised this question myself at the end last Friday night.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:14.440]   I did so because it is possible to put too much in, as it is possible to put too little
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   in.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   What do I mean?
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.360]   Well, it's very interesting to me, as I read Romans 10, 9, and 10, to notice what
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.600]   the apostle doesn't say.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:30.320]   It's quite as important to observe what he doesn't say as to observe what he does say.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   Why?
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.060]   Well, for this reason.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:41.680]   You find that several of these epistles that were written by the apostles had to be written
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.800]   because certain people were trying to put too much content into what Christians should
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   believe.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.160]   Why did he ever write that epistle to the Galatians?
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.520]   He wrote the epistle to the Galatians because those false teachers had gone round and had
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.880]   said, "That's all right.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.000]   You believe what Paul taught you, but you know that isn't enough.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.880]   You've got to be circumcised in addition."
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.200]   They said, "You must be circumcised.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.720]   It wasn't a question of choice.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.040]   It wasn't voluntary.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.720]   If you are not circumcised, you are not saved."
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.840]   They were putting the law in.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.680]   They were putting circumcision in.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   And the apostle has to write his letter in order to counteract that.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:28.200]   He has to write his first epistle to Timothy, very largely, in order to do the same thing.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:35.000]   Listen to him at the very beginning of the first epistle to Timothy in the first chapter,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.880]   where he says in verse 5, "Now the end of the commandment"âno, wait a minute, before
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.160]   thatâ"neither," he says in verse 4âwell, I must even go back to verse 3â"as I besought
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.520]   thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.720]   some that they teach no other doctrine.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:01.200]   Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.960]   edifying which is in faith.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   So do.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.560]   Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:17.600]   and of faith unfaith, which some, having swerved, have turned aside unto vain jangling, desiring
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   And on he proceeds to deal with it, and points out how these people are tending to make shipwreck
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:37.120]   of the faith because of this knowledge, as he calls it later on, "falsely so-called,"
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.520]   translated in the Authorized Version, "science falsely so-called."
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:46.360]   And then why did he ever have to write the epistle to the Colossians?
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.000]   And the answer is the same.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.040]   The Colossian heresy, the beginning of Gnosticism so-called, was this.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.840]   They said, "Ah, yes, that's all right.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.920]   Paul was all right as far as he went.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.720]   But you know, if you want the real thing, you've got to go further."
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   And they brought in all these angelic intermediaries.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.060]   Now Christ was but one of them, and they got a bit of philosophy in, and they got a bit
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.800]   of asceticism in, and philosophy and so on.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.960]   Oh, it was a jumble of all, and then some strange experiences into which you could be
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   initiated.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.560]   And you were not truly a Christian unless you went through all this in addition to what
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   Paul had said.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.720]   Now the apostle has to write all these epistles in order to deal with that very matter.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.960]   Now the trouble in all those cases was that these false teachers were putting too much
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.120]   content into the teaching.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.920]   As some put too little, others put too much.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.960]   How difficult it seems to be for Christian people to maintain a balance and avoid both
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   extremes.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.680]   Now there it is in the New Testament.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.440]   What's all this got to do with us, says somebody.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.840]   Well I don't know that there's any more urgent problem for Christian people at the present
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   time than just this.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   How?
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:02.880]   Well, are we all going back to Rome?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.520]   What is Roman Catholicism?
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.920]   Roman Catholicism is just this very thing about which I'm speaking.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.840]   According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, it is not enough for you to believe
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.760]   what I've been expounding to you the last three or four Friday nights.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.600]   You've got to believe certain things in addition.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.200]   Now this isn't my opinion.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.880]   Look at their own books.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.080]   You've got to believe in the Pope as the vicar of Christ, the head of the church.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   You've got to.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.760]   It's a matter which is vital to salvation.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.440]   You've got to believe in the Virgin Mary.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.600]   It's not a matter of choice.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.560]   You've got to believe in the Immaculate Conception, defined in 1854.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.440]   It is essential to salvation.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.120]   That means that Mary was born free from sin.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.480]   That's what the Immaculate Conception means.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.880]   It doesn't mean that our Lord was born free from sin.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.760]   It means that Mary also was.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.180]   You've got to believe that.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.840]   It's a part of the content of the doctrine of salvation.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.680]   You likewise now, since 1950, got to believe in the assumption of Mary, namely that she
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.800]   never died and was buried, but that she went up bodily into heaven.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.000]   It's a part of defined and essential doctrine.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.800]   It's a part of the content of the doctrine of salvation, of saving faith, likewise with
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.040]   the Mass.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.680]   You've got to believe it.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.520]   Now there is more with which I don't trouble you tonight.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.920]   All I'm trying to show you is this, that the Roman Catholic Church insists upon your believing
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.400]   these things also.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   Now that is what I call putting too much into it.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.960]   That's not in Romans 10, 9 and 10, is it?
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.800]   You can't draw that out of Romans 9 and 10.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.840]   I can prove to you that everything I've drawn out of Romans 10, 9 and 10 can legitimately
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.880]   be drawn out of it, but I cannot draw out of that the Immaculate Conception or the assumption
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.800]   of Mary or that Mary is a co-redemptrix or that I must believe that the Pope is the head
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   of the Church and that he's infallible.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   I don't find that there.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.680]   Neither do I find transubstantiation there or anywhere else.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.240]   But according to the Roman Church, it is essential.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.480]   That is what I say.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.080]   That is what I mean by talking about putting too much into it.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.520]   But now I want to be absolutely fair.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.480]   Let me go on.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.640]   The Roman Catholics are not the only people who are guilty of this.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.800]   Some of us are guilty of very much the same thing.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.360]   Let me put it in a blunt form like this.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:37.680]   Is it essential to believe in the doctrine of election in order to be saved?
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.640]   Is the doctrine of election in Romans 10, 9 and 10?
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.840]   But I do not hesitate to answer, it is not there.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.560]   And if you put it in, you are putting too much content in.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:55.480]   Now then, to believe in the doctrine of election is not essential to salvation.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.480]   I believe in the doctrine of election, but it is not essential to salvation.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.320]   There is all the difference in the world between believing in the way of salvation in Christ
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.160]   Jesus and understanding the mechanism of how it is worked out.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.880]   And to me, the doctrine of election belongs to the mechanism of the way it is worked out.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:27.440]   Now, all that you must read into Romans 10, 9 and 10 is that which is essential to salvation.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   No more.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.160]   There is much more truth.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.640]   But Paul is here giving a summary of that which is essential to salvation.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:40.160]   "Thou shalt be saved," this is the primitive, evangelistic message which we must give to
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.700]   men in order that they may be saved.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.880]   We must give it in all its fullness, but we must not add to it.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.800]   Otherwise we are going beyond our text.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.400]   The essential message is this.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.480]   He summarizes it in Acts 20, where he pays farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.160]   He says, "You must bear me record," he says, "how day and night I went from house to house
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.920]   and in public preaching," what?
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:11.360]   "The repentance which is toward God and the faith which is toward the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.880]   What did he preach in Athens?
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.040]   "God commandeth all men everywhere to repent."
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:25.320]   I defy anybody to give me a single example in the book of the Acts of the Apostles where
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.700]   the doctrine of election was preached in evangelistic preaching.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.120]   It is not there.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.760]   Now the principle therefore is this.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:44.720]   A full understanding of the whole doctrine, thank God, is not essential to salvation.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.680]   We ought to have it, and that's why we meet like this on Friday nights, that we may grow
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.440]   in grace and the knowledge of the Lord, that we may have a deeper and fuller understanding
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.440]   of doctrine.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.040]   But my dear friend, at the moment of belief and of salvation, you don't need to know it
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.880]   all.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.380]   And if that is put into the evangelistic message, it is to do violence to it.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.300]   We are not saved by our understanding.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.500]   We are saved by God in Christ.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:17.340]   All the fitness he requireth is to see, to feel your need of him.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.020]   The understanding follows.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.860]   What evangelistic preaching does is to call.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.900]   It calls men to repent.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.860]   It commands men to repent.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.460]   That's the evangelistic message.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.420]   That is the message of salvation.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.740]   Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.700]   Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.620]   It calls them to what the apostle has already described in the fifth verse of the first
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:49.260]   chapter of this great epistle to the Romans as the obedience of faith.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.380]   Now let me try and put this to you.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.680]   It's such an important point.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.560]   We must be fair on all sides.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.640]   Have you ever noticed the difference in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the difference
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.960]   between what was preached and the comment of Luke, the author of the book?
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.080]   Let me give you an example, two examples I think it is, of what I mean.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:18.600]   Take the first as it's found in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.360]   There you are given an account of Peter's sermon.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.600]   And you remember his sermon was a very convicting sermon.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.320]   He proves who our Lord is and how he fulfills the prophecies and so on.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.340]   And we read now when they heard this in verse 37, "They were pricked in their heart and
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.080]   said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.680]   And Peter said unto them, 'Repent.'
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.160]   Peter didn't say to them, 'You can do nothing.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.640]   You must wait until the Holy Spirit moves you.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.200]   You must make sure whether you are elect or not.'
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.600]   He didn't preach election.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.760]   He preached, 'Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.520]   the remission of sins.'
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.080]   But then notice the comment of Luke at the end.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.640]   This is where you see the difference.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.800]   'Praising God and having favor with all the people.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:13.920]   And the Lord added to the church daily, 'Such as should be saved, such as were being saved.'
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.880]   The Lord did it, of course, that's the comment.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.760]   The preaching was repent.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   It's a command.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.200]   God calleth all men everywhere to repent.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   That's a command.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.520]   That's preaching.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.920]   That's the evangelistic message that leads to faith and to salvation.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.080]   They never preached the doctrine of election.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.920]   They commanded all men everywhere to repent.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.040]   And there's another very good illustration of the same thing in the 13th chapter of the
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.000]   book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.360]   Now the content of the preaching is found in verses 39 and 40.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.600]   The 13th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.560]   Look at your content there in 39 and 40.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.560]   Or 38.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.400]   'Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.720]   the forgiveness of sins.'
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.080]   He has preaching, you see.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   You see the content.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.880]   'Through this man,' he's told them who he is, 'is preached unto you the forgiveness
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.880]   of sins.'
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.080]   There's the content I've been arguing for.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.520]   'And by him all that believe are justified from all things from which he could not be
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.240]   justified by the law of Moses.'
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   Now that's the preaching.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.800]   Listen to the comment of Luke in verse 48.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:29.240]   'And when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:34.320]   And as many as were ordained unto eternal life believed.'
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.600]   But you see Paul preaching in Antioch in Pisidia did not preach that only those who are ordained
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.440]   do believe.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.000]   That's not a part of the content of the preaching which leads to saving faith.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.620]   That is true.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.920]   But that's something that comes later.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.040]   That's the comment.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.280]   That isn't a part of the evangelistic message.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.520]   You don't have to believe that to be saved.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.440]   There is a difference between the content of the message and the comment that is made
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.960]   upon it.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.360]   In other words, have you ever noticed the difference between the preaching of the book
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.960]   of the Acts of the Apostles and the teaching of the Epistles?
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.040]   What is the difference?
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.840]   The difference is that the doctrine which is given in embryo in Acts is elaborated and
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.200]   worked out in the Epistles.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.120]   They didn't preach the whole content of the Epistles.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   No, no.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:25.560]   They preached this message which was essential and didn't go beyond it.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.720]   In other words, I would put it like this, and I'm saying this to myself and any preacher
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:36.040]   who may be present, whether ordained or unordained, lay preacher or whether he's a pastor.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   There is all the difference in the world between having your preaching controlled by theology
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.760]   and preaching theology.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.200]   Now our preaching should always be controlled by theology, but that's a very different
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.880]   thing from preaching theology.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.640]   We must be scriptural always in our method of presentation of the truth.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.480]   And what is this essential message?
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.880]   Well I would say that the great watershed is this.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.680]   Here is the vital difference.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.120]   Here are the things that are essential.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.160]   Somebody may say to me, "Well now, here you are.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.320]   You've told us that some put too little into it, some put too much into it.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.800]   How do I know how much to put into it?"
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.920]   Well I could answer that by saying, "I've been showing you for the last three or four
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.680]   Friday nights."
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.760]   It must be a legitimate and a direct deduction from the summary, and you mustn't add to
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   that.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.600]   But if you like, I'll put it like this.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.840]   Here is what I would call the great watershed at the present time.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:40.320]   You and I, my friends, may have to live through days when we'll have to decide about this.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.600]   There is a division between those who believe the evangelical message of the Bible and those
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.280]   who don't.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.000]   And I'm not interested in any other division.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.960]   And this is the thing that divides.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.200]   Revelation on the one hand, human understanding and reason on the other.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.320]   There is the first great distinction.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.200]   Do I submit myself entirely and exclusively to this book?
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:12.560]   Or do I add what I think, my reason, my understanding, my conception of God, my conception of salvation?
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.800]   It's an absolute division.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.440]   The true preaching submits itself utterly to the revelation.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   Secondly, justification by faith only, reliance upon works.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:33.320]   Now, the content of justification by faith only is what I've been putting before you.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.240]   It is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:43.280]   It is this confession that Jesus is the Lord and all that that means.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:48.440]   It is this confession from the heart that God hath raised him from the dead and all
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.720]   that that means.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:59.760]   And that is justification by faith and by faith alone.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.640]   You must not subtract from that.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.420]   You must not add to that.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.780]   We must keep this message plain and clear.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.520]   If we once begin to say with the Roman Catholics that a man is not a true Christian unless
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:19.960]   he believes this, that, and the other, or if we say with some friends that a man is
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:25.720]   not a Christian unless he believes the doctrine of election, we are wrong.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:31.060]   And the man who says the second thing is as wrong as the Roman Catholic, no, no.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.040]   We must be very careful at this point.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.200]   An Arminian can be a true Christian.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:45.080]   I say he's a very muddled-headed and confused intellectual Christian.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.420]   But God forbid that I should ever say that he's not a Christian.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.760]   If he's not believing in the doctrine of election, that saves men.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   He should believe it.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:00.460]   If he's a student of the Bible, he should believe it.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.080]   But you can be a Christian in spite of it.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.360]   Thank God you can be saved, though you may be muddled in your head.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:13.280]   I'm not excusing your muddle, but I am thanking God that we can be saved in spite of our intellectual
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.280]   muddle.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.120]   Indeed, if this were not true, there'd be nobody saved.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   Who are we and what do we know?
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.560]   Thank God we are not saved by our understanding.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:33.380]   We are saved by what God has done for us in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:41.240]   We are commanded to repent and to believe the gospel as it is presented to us.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.220]   I can't understand the man who's reading the Scriptures and who's even thinking that
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:53.560]   out in his own brain, is not driven of necessity to see that only those who are ordained unto
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.600]   eternal life ever can believe.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:04.120]   But thank God that isn't the thing that decides whether a man is saved or not.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:10.680]   If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the law of Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:19.160]   that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:27.400]   The repentance which is toward God, the faith which is toward the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   Don't be guilty, my friend, of oversimplifying and not putting enough in.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:37.080]   Don't be guilty of putting too much in and adding your postulates which go beyond the
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.520]   teaching of the word of God itself.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:46.000]   May God give us this wisdom that will keep us sane and balanced and ever above everything
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.880]   else true to the word of God itself.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   Let us pray.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:58.140]   Oh Lord, our God, we humbly beseech thee to have mercy upon us all.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:05.000]   We all see how prone we are to go astray and to insinuate ourselves and our own thinking
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.040]   and our own understanding.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.640]   God keep us.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:15.720]   We pray thee ever to that simplicity which is in Christ Jesus, the true simplicity, not
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:22.840]   the false artificial simplicity of men, but the true simplicity of the gospel itself as
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.400]   we find it in thy most holy word.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:33.120]   Oh God, wilt thou bless these things unto us, lest we be a hindrance or an obstacle
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.720]   to any soul that is outside.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:42.080]   Present unto us ever, we humbly pray thee to have a great and a deep sense of our responsibility,
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.160]   both to thee and to men and women.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:52.400]   Oh God, give us an ever greater concern and zeal for thy name and for thy glory.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.160]   Give us a greater concern, oh God, for the souls of the lost.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.560]   Keep us, oh God, from a despising of intellectual understanding.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.280]   Keep us, oh God, from a barren intellectualism.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:12.480]   Keep us, oh God, in the centre of thy word, in the centre of the truth, and in the centre
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.960]   of thy known holy will.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:21.240]   God have mercy upon us and so deal with us that even through us thou mayest be able to
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:29.720]   save others and to bring them to the knowledge of this truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:36.680]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:43.440]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:52.240]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.320]   Amen.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
