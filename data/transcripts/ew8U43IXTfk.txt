[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Anja Fernald,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.760]   co-founder of Belcampo Farms,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.360]   that was founded with the purpose to create meat
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.560]   that's good for people, the planet, and the animals,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.840]   specifically treating their animals
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900]   as ethically as possible.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.120]   In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.600]   from the inside out.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.120]   She's also a scholar and practitioner
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.080]   of regenerative agriculture,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   and she's a chef who has appeared many times
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   as a judge on "Iron Chef."
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.920]   Plus, she has one of my favorite food-related Instagrams.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.940]   On top of that, she's also a longtime friend
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.520]   of Andrew Huberman, which is how we first got connected.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.320]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.320]   Gala Games, Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic, and Fundrise.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.820]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.040]   As a side note, let me say that I got the chance to visit
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.880]   and spend a few days with Anja
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.840]   at Belcampo Farms in Northern California.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   I met many animals there, from cows to pigs,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160]   and saw the amazing land on which they grazed.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.640]   I butchered meat.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.680]   I watched Anja cook many amazing meals.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.400]   I ate raw meat and cooked meat,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.440]   and spent long hours at the bonfire talking with friends
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.800]   and listening to the sounds of nature.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.640]   I hiked, swam in a cold mountain lake,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.820]   and slept in a tent underneath the stars.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.520]   It was an amazing, eye-opening experience,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   The term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560]   The animals I met lived a great life,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.960]   but in the end, they were slaughtered
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.720]   in the most ethical way possible,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.020]   but slaughtered nevertheless.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200]   Seeing animals with whom just the day before
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.960]   I made a connection be converted to meat
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.840]   that I then consumed was deeply honest to me.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.480]   This ethical farm, Belcampo,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.320]   represents less than 1% of animals
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.120]   raised in the United States.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.560]   The rest is factory farmed.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.960]   I could not escape the thought
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.000]   of the 40 to 50 billion animals worldwide
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.400]   raised in terrible conditions on these factory farms.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.680]   I've spent most of my life thinking about
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.880]   and being in contact with human suffering,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.200]   but the landscape of suffering
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.800]   in the minds of conscious beings
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   is much larger than humans.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.240]   I must admit that I still am haunted by human suffering
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.520]   more than animal suffering.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.660]   Perhaps I will one day see the wrong
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.720]   in me drawing such a line.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.000]   Either way, the visit to Belcampo Farms
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.240]   made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.280]   about the ethics of my choices
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.160]   and the choices of human civilization
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920]   with respect to animals.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.060]   And more importantly, I have not thought or learned enough
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.080]   about large scale solutions to alleviate animal suffering.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.040]   Belcampo is paving the way on this
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.200]   and is the reason I wanted to show my support
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.960]   for their and Anja's efforts in regenerative farming
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.760]   and ethical treatment of animals.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.800]   and here is my conversation with Anja Vernald.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:15.720]   If you're watching the video version of this
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.980]   and are asking yourself why we're in nature right now,
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.960]   there's actually a beautiful mountain in the background.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.320]   There's an incredible vast landscape, there's a farm.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.920]   We're sitting behind a table and nevertheless,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   I'm wearing a suit and tie amidst nature.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.440]   We're at the beautiful Belcampo Farms.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.840]   We're going to talk about that,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.320]   this incredible place you have here,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.720]   but you cooked some meat yesterday.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.080]   It tasted delicious.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.700]   So I'd love to talk about just the science
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.020]   and art of cooking first.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.620]   You as a chef, when you think of cooking,
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.960]   is it a science or is it an art?
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.600]   - Art and service together, probably.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   Art to me because it's about creating something of beauty
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   and being responsive and creating something
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.240]   that's expression of creativity and love.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   Cooking also has a very strong element of service
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.680]   and it doesn't mean necessarily service to another person,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   but like service to health, wellness, environment.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.480]   There's an element of supporting through food
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.000]   in how I approach cooking.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.320]   So it's bigger than just like how the ingredients
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.720]   come together to form a taste.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.800]   It's the whole pipeline,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   like the fact that there's a lot of work
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.940]   that went into bringing the ingredients together
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.940]   and then giving you the ability to make the meal
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.200]   and then who gets to consume the meal and the whole thing.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.080]   And you see that as service as opposed to just the taste.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.720]   - Yeah, I also think of food as one of the key ways
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.780]   that we interact with our environment.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.600]   It's the part of our environment
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   that goes inside us most visibly.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.920]   Of course, we interact with our environment.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.520]   We could have skin creams that have certain things in them
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   or our clothes can then be absorbed.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.960]   There's things in the air, there's our water
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.000]   and there's food.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.520]   It's like how we're engaging in the world physiologically.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.680]   It's the most significant way we engage in our environment.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   - We're extracting resources, calories, energy
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.000]   from the environment in various ways
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.160]   in order to preserve our bodies.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.360]   - There's also so many feedback loops
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   that I don't think we know the beginning of
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.040]   that our bodies are picking up on around nutrients,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.640]   available nutrients, immune response.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.840]   Like there's deep levels of sensory evaluation
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.240]   that lead to health and alertness and wellness.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.340]   You hear about this a lot, like with babies,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.900]   that if there's a risk of an infection
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.400]   that a mom's breast milk will help the baby
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.800]   develop a resistance.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.360]   Like there's this way that our bodies can tune into health
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.680]   and can't extrapolate from that in any specific way.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.280]   But think about that as an example of like the many ways
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.440]   in which our bodies are reading available nutrients and food
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.720]   to signal other aspects of wellness and health.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.200]   - That said, the final product of cooking
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.760]   is when done well is really delicious.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.560]   And what we ate yesterday was really delicious.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   So that aspect of it, bringing the ingredients together
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.520]   in a way that tastes delicious,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.880]   do you see that as a science or art?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.200]   - That's the art of it.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.520]   I mean, the art is like creating temptation and indulgence
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   and giving people pause, you know,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.960]   like creating experience that's like so sensual.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   And like, I love that about when I make something
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.640]   really simple and beautiful and delicious,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.000]   the way that like there's that moment of silence
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   at the table, and that to me is the moment of art,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720]   like of appreciation.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   - What about the buildup?
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   I mean, we got to watch you make the stuff over a fire.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.080]   So the calmness of the air, I mean, that's an experience.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.840]   We don't often get to see that experience of the preparation.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.560]   It's the anticipation, like you said.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.200]   Maybe that's the most delicious part of a meal
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.840]   is the anticipation of it.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.560]   - That's something that I'm glad you bring up
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.680]   'cause it's an element that with eating so many of our meals
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.120]   like out of a bag and, you know,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.880]   the instance where you start to eat the meals
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   when the delivery shows up and you might smell something
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.120]   when you open the bag, right?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.600]   And no judgment on that.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.160]   That's something I do too, right?
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.520]   But that does take away a whole element
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.920]   of surprise and delight.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   And also I think of your body's ability to prepare for it.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.480]   You know, you think about our most common memories
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.200]   of childhood for those of us who grew up in homes
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.760]   with parents who cooked is smell of things cooking.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   And it's not the eating of it,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.000]   it's the smell of things cooking.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.400]   So why is that so memorable?
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.200]   It's an anticipatory piece of food.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.520]   That's what you remember about your experiences of food
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.320]   is the moment of like sweet anticipation
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.160]   of this great sensual experience
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.960]   that's gonna be really gratifying
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   on these emotional and physical levels.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.680]   So I think we're also resonating on those memories
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   because it's like, it's an experience of food
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.040]   where the sensuality of it is kind of extended.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.080]   So it's a long kind of arc of buildup
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.560]   and then you're eating it and it's amazing
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.760]   and then you're enjoying it and your body feels good.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   So all those pieces together,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.880]   it's a much more memorable experience
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.000]   than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.680]   So look at our own and just revisit in your mind,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.480]   like the memories of food, the most compelling ones,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.880]   it's the smell and then the experience
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   and then sometimes how one felt, right?
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   - Yeah, and the people involved with the smell.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.240]   So like somehow it's all tied in together,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.120]   whether it's family or people close to you,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.560]   or even if it's just chefs,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.680]   there's something about the personality of the human
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.760]   involved in making the food
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   that kind of sticks with you in the memory.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.000]   And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and there's a kind of sadness after you eat that it's over.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.440]   I think the most delicious part was the,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.920]   I went to the grocery store
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.600]   and just actually walking around
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.400]   and looking at food with like everything looked delicious,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.520]   even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.480]   and I missed that.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.080]   I really enjoyed that anticipation
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.640]   and then I picked out the meal,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.600]   I went home and I cooked it and the whole thing took,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.480]   I don't know, maybe two, three hours,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480]   like the whole process.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.520]   And that was the most delicious part
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.720]   and the first taste of course.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.640]   And then after it was over, there's a bit of a sadness
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.880]   'cause the part I remember is the buildup, the anticipation.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.040]   And then once you eat, it's over.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.080]   We kind of focus on the destination,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.400]   but it's the whole journey.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   The whole, like, even if you go to a restaurant,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.200]   it's the conversations leading up to the meal
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.520]   and the first taste of the meal, that's where the joy is.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.360]   And if you get to watch the making of that meal,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.400]   that's incredible.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.240]   That's where the smell, the visual,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   how the ingredients come together,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.440]   especially as we were looking over the fire,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   like watching it, the fire play with the raw meat
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.920]   and over time bring out the colors, bring out the,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.480]   I don't know, like you can visually associate the flavor,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.560]   how it becomes a little bit burnt on the outside,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.760]   it has a crispiness to it,
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.960]   it starts to gain that crispiness
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.240]   and immediately your past memories
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.640]   of the delicious crispiness of various foods you've eaten
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.480]   are somehow mapped into your,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.200]   immediately you start to taste it visually.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.160]   I don't know, yeah, that experience is magical.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.760]   And of course, maybe it's the Russian thing,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.680]   but I'm almost like saddened when it's over.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.720]   - I think fasting is gaining in popularity
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.320]   because we're having to relearn the importance
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.840]   of being hungry in anticipation and delight.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.440]   We have such a fear of hunger
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.880]   and that's really functional in evolution, right?
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.280]   But we have this deep fear of hunger
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.200]   and part of the great American experience
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.480]   has been that we don't have to be afraid of hunger at all
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.160]   'cause there's food everywhere and it's really cheap.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.960]   In all that abundance, we've lost this edge of hunger
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   and we don't let ourselves get hungry.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.080]   And that's one thing that I learned
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.840]   in part of my journey as a cook
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.280]   and chef has been moving abroad
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.840]   was the first time when I lived out of the US
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.640]   was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.960]   because the time between meals was really long
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.160]   and that was just what everybody did.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.400]   And that was the first time in my life
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.240]   that there hadn't just been readily available snacks.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.760]   So I wonder if the intermittent fasting
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.800]   and part of the popularity around it,
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.040]   I'm sure there's all these amazing metabolic things
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.640]   that are happening, but also people might also feel better
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.360]   because they're really anticipating and enjoying food.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.840]   And then if you look at the feelings of fullness,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.360]   there's a really interesting thing that happens
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.240]   when you cook and your sense of fullness,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.360]   which is if you cook and you're hungry,
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.280]   the experience of being around the food,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   smelling it, touching it, sampling it,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.680]   you'll take your hunger down by 40%.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   And this is my own observation,
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.400]   but as we've all had the experience of cooking Thanksgiving
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.600]   and the cook never kind of wants
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.560]   to eat that much Thanksgiving.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.020]   That's an extreme experience.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.260]   But when you really dive in and you're cooking
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.120]   for a few hours and you're smelling and smelling
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.680]   and smelling, it totally changes your threshold
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.200]   of satiety and fullness because of other sensory things
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.560]   that are happening.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.600]   And for those of us looking to maintain weight
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.780]   and something to consider in this is that cooking
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.000]   is also part of what your appetite when you're hungry,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.040]   what are you hungry for?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.840]   So we tend to think about calories,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.120]   but when you're hungry, you might also be hungrier
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.520]   for a wider range of things.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.840]   And it might be smells, it might be stopping.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.760]   There's other elements and that's something,
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.000]   think as a cook that it's powerful to explore
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.360]   and be with and observe how your hunger changes
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.960]   when you're cooking.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.600]   - Well, let me ask the romantic question.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.440]   When did you first fall in love with cooking?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.400]   - Me falling in love with cooking
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.800]   was about solving a problem in my family.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   And it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.560]   about cooking and overwhelmed frequently
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.680]   when it came to meals.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.640]   And I'm naturally very good at juggling a lot of things.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.120]   And it was just something I could dive in and help
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   and help my dad, who's very, I'm very, very close to.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.360]   So it was a very functional role where I would see
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.120]   this kind of crescendo of anxiety around mealtimes as a kid
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.120]   and would be able to dive in and solve things.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.560]   And I also loved women who cooked.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.520]   Like my father's mother is a great cook.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.200]   She was, I remember her telling me as a kid,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.680]   I was asking her about church and why she went to church.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.120]   And she's like, I mostly go to church
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.240]   because I get to cook for the potlucks.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.840]   And so there was an openness around that,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.120]   but she just loved to cook for people.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.960]   And there was this real tenderness
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.600]   and expression of that love.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.360]   So seeing women in my life who had this real tenderness
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.920]   and love that they shared through food,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.560]   and then also being able in my own home
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.640]   to kind of pitch in and add value
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   and help my mom and dad was really powerful for me
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.160]   'cause I felt like I had a superpower.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.080]   I felt like, oh man,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.440]   I just made this stressful thing go away.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.520]   That was huge.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.360]   - It's kind of interesting.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.680]   I don't know if you can comment on,
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.440]   especially for me growing up in Russia,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.840]   it's probably true in a lot of cultures,
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.120]   maybe every culture that food,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.160]   and especially like in a family,
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.440]   the mother that cooks is the source of love
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.160]   and like ties the family together,
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.760]   creates events where everyone comes together.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.040]   It's one of the only chances of togetherness,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.600]   the thing that bonds a family is like dinner
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.520]   or food, eating together.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   And I don't know what to do with that.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.160]   It ties up with like dieting and so on.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.560]   When I was on stricter diets,
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.120]   especially competing and cutting weight and stuff,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.980]   it felt like I was almost like losing opportunity
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.920]   to connect with friends and family.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.220]   It's interesting.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.080]   It almost like cultures,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.480]   we cannot fully experience love and family
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.640]   without eating.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.200]   And on the flip side of that,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.000]   eating enables us to experience love and family.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.540]   I don't know what to do with that.
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.560]   - It's a tough one 'cause there's lots of layers
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.560]   around kind of gender roles and families changing and things.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.720]   I'd say I agree around the alienation
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.280]   and I've done carnivore diet
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.000]   and I've tried some of these extreme protocols
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.400]   and I too, I suffered from loneliness.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.240]   You know, it was like doing carnivore
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.840]   and not being able to eat what my kids ate
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.600]   and talk about it at the same time.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.320]   Those pieces are real.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.540]   And I wonder with all of these diets,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.320]   if that structure is actually helping
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.280]   or just taking away from people's
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.460]   kind of sensual understanding.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.120]   But I think that there's some rigor around that
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.720]   that helps people discover what's good for them
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.340]   by eliminating and then growing towards more intuitive food
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.180]   is a good evolution from that base.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.880]   I love to cook for people.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.560]   I love to pay attention to their way of being
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.680]   and read what they'd like to eat.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.640]   And it's my purest way of love.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.660]   And that's for everybody in my life.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.080]   I actually love to cook for people I love.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.520]   You know, I don't, I would struggle to be,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.000]   you know, putting out food all the time.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   It's like something for me, it's a real act of caretaking.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.840]   So I definitely have that in my makeup.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.760]   And I definitely notice in times of like,
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.760]   of real stress, that's the piece that drops off, right?
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.960]   And then, and it's like, if I'm unable to care for myself,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.320]   I have a hard time cooking.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.840]   So it's, for me, it's very emotional.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.240]   It's very connected to love.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.320]   - And individualistic.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.060]   So like focused on the particular individual.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.480]   It's almost like a journey of understanding
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.640]   what that person is excited about
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.200]   in the landscape of flavors.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.480]   Like figuring that person out what they like,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.200]   what they love to eat.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.800]   - I see cooking from, I mostly cook for myself.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.560]   So I see that as almost a,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.160]   this is gonna be like the worst term,
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.800]   but like an act of self-love.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.000]   This is gonna be clipped out.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.680]   That like, it's almost an exploration
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.000]   of like what brings me joy.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.800]   And it's surprising 'cause I usually don't share
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.680]   'cause the things that bring me joy
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.160]   are the simplest ingredients.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.420]   Like I'm one of those people,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.120]   I don't know if you can psychoanalyze me
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.860]   'cause you also like basic ingredients.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.640]   I like a single ingredient, two ingredients,
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.520]   'cause I feel like I can deeply appreciate
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.360]   the particular ingredient then.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.460]   I get easily distracted.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.360]   You know, people who are really good at listening to music,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.000]   they can hear a piece of music
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.720]   and in their mind extract the different layers
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.660]   and enjoy different layers at a time.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.560]   Like the bass, the drums,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.040]   the different layering of the piano,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.780]   the beats and all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.880]   That's what it means to truly enjoy music,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.680]   to listen to a piece over and over.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.600]   Like almost like as a scholar.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.840]   In that same way for food,
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.600]   I just can't do more than like three
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.300]   'cause then it's just,
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.880]   I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.600]   But when it's just the basic ingredients,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.920]   like just meat or just the vegetable,
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.320]   like basic grilled without sauces, without any of that,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.280]   that I've discovered is what brings me a lot of joy.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   But that's boring to a lot of people.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.760]   So I usually have to be kind of private about that joy.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.760]   So, but that's mine.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.000]   So yeah, I figured that out.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.560]   And I guess as a chef,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.960]   you have to figure that out
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.860]   about everybody that you care for.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.880]   - Well, also for you,
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.880]   you're very interested in things
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.120]   and interested in things being done well
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   and appreciating them.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.720]   So the single ingredient also allows you to control
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.400]   for perfection and cooking that,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.280]   which is probably really appealing to you.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.760]   And I think sometimes I see people
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.440]   also in the beginning of their journey of culinary
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.260]   trying to do too many things, right?
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.040]   So there's another piece too,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.400]   that you'll notice if you recall last night,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.240]   I grilled us a salad, right?
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.560]   And then I did all those pieces separately.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.240]   And that's something in general to be really attentive of
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.720]   when you're building flavor,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.680]   to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.560]   The idea that you can,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.000]   okay, with a soup or something or a stew,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.560]   there's workarounds,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.320]   but like to make a great dish
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.520]   that's got four or five vegetables in it,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.340]   cook them all separately to their optimal deliciousness
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.660]   and then combine them.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.300]   So that's another way to approach that
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.700]   is that you may also be able to look
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.380]   at the different ingredients separately
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.540]   and still have that sense of like understanding of it.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.300]   But there's too often that we're layering together
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   like four or five things
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.700]   and then cooking them all at once
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.540]   and then surprised that it's not delicious.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.060]   'Cause you can't really optimize on multiple variables
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.740]   at the same time for peak awesomeness.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.860]   And that's actually,
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.700]   the number one way you see this is roasting a whole chicken,
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.780]   which is a really difficult,
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.620]   it's the simplest dish,
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.720]   but it's very difficult
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.900]   because you have the breast meat,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.660]   which is bigger chunks.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.600]   They cook faster.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.440]   You have the thighs and drums,
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.200]   which are smaller and they cook slower.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.120]   To optimize that and pay attention to it
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.960]   and do it all right,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.440]   there you're actually solving for different outcomes.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.040]   So there's one example,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.560]   but oftentimes food is less delicious
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.360]   with multiple ingredients at the start
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.420]   because we're not able to pay attention
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.760]   to how each one needs to end up.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.560]   So there's a way to parse that apart
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.840]   and achieve a better outcome.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.240]   - I don't know if you've seen "Jiro Dreams of Sushi."
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   It's a documentary about, yeah.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.200]   So there's an obsession that that particular,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.600]   first of all, set of humans,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.360]   but also the particular cuisine
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.620]   that focused on the basics of the ingredients.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.600]   What do you think of that kind of trying to achieve mastery
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.160]   through repeating the making of the same meal
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.880]   over and over and over for decades?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.240]   Like, do you find beauty in that journey towards mastery
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.600]   or do you think it should be always an exploration
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.240]   to where you're always trying things,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.620]   you're always kind of injecting new flavors,
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.760]   new experiences, all that kind of stuff?
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.520]   - I think you have to decide on a palette.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.000]   You know, if we're talking about an art,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.640]   it's equivalent to saying, am I a sculptor or a painter?
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.480]   - Yeah.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.600]   - And I think that the sushi lexicon thing,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.920]   that's a very, very narrow, small canvas
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.140]   that you're painting on.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.120]   And that is a beautiful road, right?
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.800]   There's a beauty and a perfection to that.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.720]   It's like, I mean, there's many things culturally
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.480]   around that that you could extrapolate
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.560]   for specifically for Japan.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.440]   But I encourage people on the journey in food
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.520]   to choose like kind of a language
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.320]   that they're working within.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   And if you wanna step out of that occasionally
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.980]   and have one or two dishes,
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.280]   but if you wanna get mastery with food,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   you probably aren't gonna be able to get more than say,
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.600]   20 ingredients that you use regularly
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.420]   that you really understand.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.600]   And so we often see, you know, I see the American pantry,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.720]   it's got tons of sauces and tons of spices
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.560]   and tons of spice blends.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.880]   And then really people only use just a couple of things.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.600]   And the idea that you can sort of splash out
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.760]   and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night,
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.680]   you can absolutely, but to get in a regular cadence
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.640]   of specific ingredients,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.880]   you're probably gonna get more mastery with that sooner.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.380]   And I think as much as you can do to get an understanding
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.840]   of the basics around salt and acid
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.880]   and understand your palate,
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.540]   like for me, it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right?
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.880]   So that's my acid palate.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.180]   And my fat palates, you know, suet and butter, olive oil.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.780]   So you can sort of choose your language,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.340]   what you're painting with,
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.380]   but I wouldn't splash out and say, do I use sesame oil?
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.560]   Yeah, every once in a while,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.480]   but that's not part of my base palate, right?
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.840]   - Can you say again what your fat palate is?
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.720]   - It'd be butter, suet and olive oil.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.680]   - And olive oil, so not, why olive oil?
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.320]   Is it your routine?
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.840]   - I like the flavor for finish
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   because of the bitterness that it adds.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.760]   So I like the bitter and acid contrast on meat
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   and vegetables, which is mostly what I eat.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.040]   And so I love that way that the bitterness
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.840]   and astringency complements
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.320]   and allows the flavors to come out.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.240]   - What do you think about coconut oil?
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.760]   I recently discovered that there's a, I don't know,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.920]   there's a sweetness or there's something to it
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   that I really enjoy, maybe because it's new.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.480]   It's good with heat.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.040]   I really love it for some reason.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.720]   As a chef, do you ever try it?
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.560]   What do you think about it?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.640]   - I like it in coffee.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.960]   Like I like it as a, like a treat a little bit.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.400]   I find the flavor a little bit challenging in foods.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.160]   I also find that it's difficult
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   on the quality of that ingredient.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.280]   So I've found often that I buy a high quality coconut oil
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.120]   and there's rancidity in it.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.160]   And I don't totally know why.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.480]   I think it's just the cold chain
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.280]   and how that product's packaged.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.080]   So I've had some issues with product quality in that.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.120]   But for me, it's a little bit too much sweetness
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.520]   in my foods.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.080]   But then again, I don't cook in like a Southeast Asian palate.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.000]   I try to not have much sweetness in my foods in general.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.080]   So I, just because of the palate that I like to cook with.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.120]   So for me, coconut's got a little bit too much
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.960]   of those high notes and earthiness,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   which is a nice combination, but it's more like a treat.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.680]   - Yeah, it is almost like a treat.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.600]   It has a flavor of its own that almost stands on its own.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.080]   Like I could probably just eat coconut.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.360]   (laughs)
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.520]   That's probably the only oil I could enjoy by itself.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.440]   It sounds weird to say, but it feels like fat
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.560]   is often a thing that enriches the flavor of something else.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.400]   Coconut can almost stand on its own.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.040]   - You might also be responding to that
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.480]   it's a complex flavor.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.320]   - Right.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.440]   - So there's also, there's an analogous,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.600]   you know, if you look at butter, for example,
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.440]   a lot of the butter that we eat in the US
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.320]   is just sweet cream butter.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.440]   It's not cultured.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.480]   If you explore like a cultured fermented butter,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.200]   maybe a grass milk, grass fed and finished butter,
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.560]   you're gonna get a ton more complexity.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.800]   And so you may also just be responding
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.080]   to having fats with more flavor,
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.160]   which is the journey in the US
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.840]   has been towards refined foods that are very neutral.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.720]   And then you have to combine more of them
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.440]   to make things taste like things.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   And so if you're coming from a background
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   of using mostly just generic butter,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.680]   or let's say canola oil to cook with,
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.340]   those are very neutral oils.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.760]   So you can also take some of your favorite fats
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.100]   and look for versions of them that are more flavorful.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.400]   I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.240]   - Really?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.480]   - Like a good California extra virgin olive oil.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.320]   I'll just like have it as,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.840]   I'll eat a piece of butter as a treat.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.680]   - Yeah.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.040]   - That's like, or butter with salt on it.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.200]   Like good fats can, all of them can be,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.560]   if they're minimally processed and they're fabulous,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.800]   and it's so delicious, right?
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.040]   But there are things that you have to like look for
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.160]   a version of them that's got that full palette of flavor.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.000]   - Well, for me also,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.720]   the flavors are inextricably tied to the memories
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.760]   I've had with those flavors.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.000]   So for better or worse,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.240]   back when I used to eat a lot of ice cream,
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.080]   I, for some reason,
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.480]   had a lot of pleasant experience with coconut ice cream.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.280]   So that particular flavor just permeates throughout my life.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.840]   Now, like I'm stuck with it for better or worse
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.480]   as a flavor that brings up pleasant memories.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.640]   And as I have a few such flavors,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.600]   I have such relationship with all kinds of meat too.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.160]   Like it's just so many pleasant memories and that's it.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.360]   Like you're almost tasting the memories.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.200]   - Yeah.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   - And that there's no way to separate the flavor
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.600]   from the memories, I suppose.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.960]   And that's a powerful thing.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.660]   What's your favorite meal to cook?
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.480]   - I'll roast a couple of chickens
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.800]   and then I'll poach them, like I'll boil them
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.640]   and let it cool down.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.360]   It's a complicated one.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.840]   I'll let them cool down.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.800]   I'll pull all the meat off,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.760]   put the bones back into the pot
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.000]   and then cook that for like three or four hours
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.200]   and then add in like shiitake mushrooms
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.840]   and all the chicken meat.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.280]   And I'll throw in a bottle of white wine
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.680]   into the stock as well, a bunch of thyme and garlic.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   And I love it because it's the way the house smells.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.000]   It's very laborious.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.040]   It's soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.940]   and chopping things up.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.680]   There's like a lot of manuality around it.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.400]   So I'd say from a personal, like, I mean,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.080]   I love grilling a steak and doing those things as well,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.600]   but there's something about making a stock from scratch
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.800]   and the way it smells, the way I feel,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   the time it takes, the kind of checking in on it
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.400]   that I really, really love.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.260]   There's many things that I love to make
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.440]   that I don't even love to eat.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.200]   I think you see this a lot in like baking and bakers,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.920]   people who bake a ton and they love the process of it,
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.680]   even if they don't eat that many baked goods.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.440]   So anything for me that's really like enjoyable
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.280]   is typically things like making cinnamon buns.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.640]   I don't eat very many cinnamon buns,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.120]   but I love making them because it takes all the sort
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.200]   of like futzing around and taking your time
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.080]   and watching it and the way it smells,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.920]   the way the house smells, all of that stuff is like,
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.400]   it's like almost like a meditative exercise for me.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.500]   - Is there a science, is there an art to cooking meat well
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.000]   and the different kinds of meats?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.300]   Is there something you can convert into words
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:14.520]   in to say ideas, how to bring out the best of it
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.460]   out of what particular meat,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.500]   whatever steak we're talking about,
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.400]   whatever beef we're talking about,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.840]   is there something that can be said?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.480]   - The basic approach to cooking any type of meat
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.540]   beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.180]   and it's what type of muscle is it in the animal
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.340]   and what's the surface area to volume ratio?
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.780]   Okay, so let's look at those two questions.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.120]   So the first piece is what's the type of muscle
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.340]   in the animal, what's the functionality?
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.200]   You don't necessarily need to know that to evaluate it,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.560]   but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   that's not used very frequently in the animal
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.240]   or is it a big load bearing muscle
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.380]   that gets a lot of action like the cheek, right?
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   Or the shin or those pieces.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.200]   The muscles like those along the spinal cord
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.560]   that make up rib eyes and New York steaks and things,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.200]   those aren't very exercised.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.160]   They're right next to the spinal cord.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.700]   Spinal cord's doing most of the work there.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.720]   They're kind of like stabilizing muscles
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.440]   around this big functional piece
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.400]   of skeletal structure in the animal.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.680]   Other muscles like the ones around the diaphragm
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.600]   those are really functional muscles
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.320]   that are doing a ton and moving.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.240]   And if they're moving a lot,
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.360]   what happens?
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.060]   Well, functionally, they've got lots of muscle sheaths
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.980]   because muscles that move frequently
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.320]   have to do a lot of like complex contraction.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.980]   That's why there's, in the cheek, for example,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.980]   there's tons of visible fiber
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.280]   of like collagenous connective tissue.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:53.380]   That connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.700]   because connective tissue doesn't respond to high heat
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.240]   with becoming more tender.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.220]   Muscles do, right?
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   They can get a sear on them.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.340]   You can cut them and eat them.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.740]   The collagenous tissue will glom up and get really tough.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.360]   So you either have to liquefy it
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.860]   with really low, slow heat with moisture, right?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.660]   Or you have to barely cook it.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.060]   And so that's the major piece.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.880]   So that's the question of like,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.220]   why wouldn't you just throw a brisket on the grill?
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.420]   Okay, it's not about the fat.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.460]   You can cut the fat out.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.300]   The reason you're not gonna throw a brisket on the grill
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.140]   and cook it hot and fast
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.820]   is it's got too much collagenous connective tissue in it.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.740]   Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.060]   and these fibers and tendons in them effectively.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.260]   So you're never gonna be able to just cook that up hot fast.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.980]   So that's the first piece.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.700]   It's like, where's this muscle
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.480]   in the architecture of the animal?
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.180]   And then what does that mean
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.860]   for what's going on in the muscle?
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.580]   And that's actually more important than fat content.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.780]   We get really kind of,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.460]   we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.620]   You can make a steak tender
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.940]   if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.980]   It actually has more to do
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.760]   if there's collagenous and connective tissue in it.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.700]   That's fascinating.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.620]   I never even thought about that.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.900]   I just, I thought it kind of universe,
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.660]   I mean, adds to the texture of the meat,
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.380]   the chewiness of the meat.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.300]   But you're saying it's also adds to how heat,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.320]   how it reacts to heat,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.820]   how the entirety of the meat reacts to heat.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.060]   And the fat is not as important to that
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.180]   as the collagen.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.420]   The fat will make the flavor more delicious, right?
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.700]   Like it'll add unctuousness and mouthfeel
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.540]   and things like that.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.200]   But all the connective tissue in meat,
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.220]   and in some of the cuts,
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.800]   like that we ate a skirt steak last night,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.460]   you could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.860]   On a rib eye, that same collagen sheath is this big.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.340]   There's only one that goes around the outside.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.820]   Okay, 'cause that's just that muscle,
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.880]   there's one large muscle fiber.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.580]   So that specific, it's a myelin sheath, right?
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.860]   That material needs moisture
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.520]   and low and slow heat to become tender.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.820]   The other side of that is that
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.980]   when it becomes tender, it liquefies
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.540]   and it adds all this beautiful gelatinous consistency.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.660]   That's what bone broth is.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.980]   That's why like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.780]   It's not that it's full of all that fat.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.620]   That fat's also great,
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.560]   but a lot of that mouthfeel comes from that really
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.580]   beautiful dissolved collagen.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.420]   So when you're looking at like,
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.660]   how do I understand how I'm gonna cook a piece of meat?
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.580]   That first fork in the road is
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.180]   how is this gonna respond to heat?
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.300]   And what's the appropriate cooking technique?
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.360]   Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.560]   And that's important because the heat is gonna impact
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.960]   the meat through the surfaces of the meat
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.680]   that are in contact with the heat.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:40.780]   So if I have a steak that's three inches thick,
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.660]   I'm gonna cook it extremely differently
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.740]   from a steak that's a half inch thick
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.340]   or three quarters of an inch thick.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.260]   And that's the major, and that's the truth.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.900]   If I have a piece of pork shoulder that's cut into cubes
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.900]   versus having a whole pork shoulder,
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.500]   that's surface area to volume ratio.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.140]   That's gonna totally change how I cook it.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.720]   And same things like pot roast and a beef stew
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.700]   would be the same cut of meat, right?
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.480]   But how I cook them is gonna change
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.780]   based on the surface area to volume.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.660]   'Cause you've gotta let moisture and heat work its way
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.060]   into the center of the meat.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.520]   And that's gonna be determined by the amount of surface
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.380]   of the meat that's in contact with whatever
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.120]   cooking liquid or heat you've got.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.700]   - Is there different sources of heat to play with?
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.000]   Like a big flame versus a small,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.780]   or maybe even like almost no flame,
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.340]   like over coals, all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.840]   Is there some science to the source of heat
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.720]   in how it plays with the meat?
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.000]   - Well, there's indirect heat and direct heat.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And that really is mostly about temperature
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.800]   in more than actual, I mean,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.360]   smoke is important as well that can permeate,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.160]   but really the smoke doesn't go into the center
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.280]   of most cuts that you barbecue.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.840]   It'll come in like a smoke ring.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.720]   It's maximum like half an inch on the outside,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.120]   maybe a little bit deeper on a really long, slow cook.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.800]   So, but the smoke that does create a ton of flavor
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.360]   on the surface of the meat.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.840]   But that's so the indirect allows you to have
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.640]   smoke contacting it and then a very,
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.240]   very low and slow heat.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.680]   And what that does is indirect heat
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.520]   will be low and slow enough that the center of the meat
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.560]   will get warm at the same time as the exterior of the meat.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.300]   And it'll all cook equally and all get equally tender.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.440]   If you go very hot and fast,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.560]   you risk the interior of the meat, not getting, right?
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.840]   You kind of create a shell on it
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   and you slow down the interior of the meat,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.880]   which you actually want to do with something like a steak
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.360]   where you want to keep it rare on the inside.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   So it's really indirect versus direct.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.400]   Then once you get into direct heat, right?
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.780]   Look at in that category, there's wood, charcoal, gas,
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.920]   right? That's about it.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.400]   And those are meaningfully different.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.680]   They're meaningfully different.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.760]   Charcoal and wood, that's more of,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.360]   there's more poetry in wood.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.280]   There's a little bit more flavor,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.080]   not functionally very different,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.220]   but gas versus charcoal wood is very different.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.200]   And that's because of the actual scent of the cook, right?
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.520]   The scent of the flavor.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.260]   And then there's, I think, an evenness of heat distribution
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.960]   that comes off of charcoal that's different from gas,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.780]   because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.340]   you do have hotter and cooler spots.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.980]   So gas grills are typically,
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.420]   you can kind of control for that
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.580]   if you just are going really hot and fast,
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.940]   which is why gas grills are fine
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.460]   if you're just like throwing that steak on,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.620]   get a hard sear on it, those burgers, put a crust on it.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.740]   Gas is fabulous for that.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.740]   It's perfect.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.740]   When you're doing things that do better
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.220]   with a low and slow cook,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.540]   like let's say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.980]   that's going to be a little bit less elegant on gas
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.540]   than on charcoal versus wood.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.960]   So when you have more kind of nuance in the low, slow cook
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.600]   over the natural fuels.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.960]   - Talking about like smoke and flame
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.700]   and charcoal versus gas,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.720]   it also adds to the experience and the smell
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.040]   and the whole thing of the cooking
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   versus just like the taste it creates.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.680]   There's a certain experience to like
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.160]   when there's a bit of smoke,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.680]   maybe, I don't know what the chemistry of it is,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.960]   but I feel like with smoke,
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.000]   the smell is distributed more effectively.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.840]   I don't know if that's true,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.840]   but there's a smell and a visual aspect to the experience
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.040]   that's almost enriched with a bit of smoke
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   or like an open flame.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   Like if you can see the flame, there's magic to that.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.400]   And it goes to the experience piece
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.320]   that we were talking about.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.040]   - We were talking exactly about that,
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.560]   like the nuance and the beauty of like that long, slow cook
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.280]   and your house smelling like something.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.320]   Why do people freak out about barbecue?
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.280]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.120]   - Why?
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.520]   'Cause you go in and it smells bomb.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.200]   It smells so good.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.720]   It smells like heaven, right?
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.960]   It smells fatty and delicious and the smells everywhere
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.600]   and everyone's smelling the same smell.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.920]   So there's like this collective experience.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.040]   It's incredible.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   That's, I mean, I think that's why barbecue
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.160]   is so sticky for people.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.760]   - Yeah. - It's like so yummy
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.640]   and you get this huge like anticipatory thing about it.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.760]   It's like, 'cause it smells incredible.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.840]   - What was that incredible grill that we used yesterday?
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.680]   What is that about?
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.280]   - That's called a Sea Island Forge.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.680]   It's a wood fire grill that's inspired
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.720]   by like a South American style of cooking.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.840]   So it's like, it's big.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.520]   It has also the things with the crank
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   that allows you to control the distance from the flame.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.840]   It's awesome.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.880]   - That's really key with the wood fire.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.400]   So when we evolved from cooking over wood to charcoal,
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.000]   right, when that became more popular,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.320]   the reason that we did that is that allowed us
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.680]   to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal, right?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.960]   So when you're cooking over wood,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.120]   all you're doing is making your own charcoal.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.880]   You don't ever cook over wood with the red fire.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.760]   Like we don't like throw a steak on
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.560]   when the flames are orange and leaping up
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.160]   because you're just gonna get, you know,
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.480]   carbons like char all over your meat.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.000]   So when you're cooking over wood,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.520]   you first cook down the wood,
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.240]   you create the coal base, the natural coal base,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.400]   and then you cook over that.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.960]   So you saw yesterday, I built my fire,
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.680]   I let it burn down, added some fresh wood
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.120]   but then I was actually cooking over the embers.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.920]   You shorten that cycle with charcoal.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.360]   It's more efficient.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.400]   But what you lose is that whole cycle of, you know,
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.520]   that really beautiful experience of smelling.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.080]   Now, if you're cooking on a Traeger,
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.480]   you're gonna get awesome smoke smell.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.800]   You know, like there's plenty of ways to do this.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.000]   It doesn't always have to be wood fire.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.800]   And I love all the different ways, right?
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.480]   But I really like the experience of the campfire.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.280]   And I love that kind of just like sitting by it,
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.760]   building it, having to take the time,
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.600]   I like building the fire, going inside,
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.160]   preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.080]   That whole experience start to finish
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.160]   is really just like something that it's my favorite.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.640]   It's my favorite way to spend time, you know?
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.080]   So I think, and why is that?
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.720]   Is the food that different than cooking it
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.480]   in a more conventional grill?
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.000]   Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.880]   but I think the actual experience is super memorable
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.320]   because you are outside, you are slowing your roll,
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.640]   you're enjoying this, you know, you're just taking in,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.680]   you're watching, you're anticipating.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.720]   I love that whole experience.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.600]   - Does the origin of the meat itself make a difference?
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   So we're here at Balcampo Farms,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.200]   and maybe you could talk about what your vision,
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.560]   your dream is in terms of like food,
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.800]   in terms of where food comes from,
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.120]   where meat comes from, but food broadly,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.320]   and how that affects the entirety of the culinary journey.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.360]   - On the question of where does it come from
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.800]   and does that matter, I'd say the way that meat is raised
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.560]   is massively important for flavor and for how it cooks.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:41.440]   I think most cooks who try cooking grass-fed
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.480]   versus corn-fed, that's the first moment
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.880]   where they realize that, right?
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.920]   Where corn-fed meat cooks much more slowly,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.040]   it's got bigger veins of fat that slow the heat transfer
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.000]   throughout the muscle of the animal,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.560]   compared to grass-fed, which is leaner,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.280]   heat moves through it more quickly,
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.240]   those steaks will cook much, much faster.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.920]   So there's very kind of technical reasons
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:07.240]   why how meat is raised that we're aware of.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.600]   And there's other things that I've noticed,
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   like that slower growing poultry
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.760]   has a very, very different musculature and fiber to it
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.960]   than fast growing poultry, that's confinement animals.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.800]   It's just, it has to do with the way
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   that the muscles are built.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.040]   They tend to be finer and thinner and more tender,
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.000]   and a little bit more susceptible to heat.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.240]   So the character of the meat's radically different.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.000]   It's also much more flavorful
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.680]   when it's grown more naturally.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.240]   And I think some of the reliance in the US
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.200]   on like sugary sauces and lots of salts
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.840]   and flavors and things, like that's actually based
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.000]   on having the broadly available meat out there
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.640]   is pretty low on flavor.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.400]   And so we're adding in a lot to compensate for that.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.880]   So to your point of like enjoying things very simply
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.600]   and with like salt and nothing else,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   like the more flavorful that product is,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.560]   I think the more people will find that enjoyable.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.280]   - Let's paint a vision.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.440]   I mean, you're a visionary.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   You have a vision to have basically meat in every store
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.160]   that comes from a farm like Belcampo
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.320]   that's basically doing regenerative farming.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.160]   How do we get there?
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.400]   - It's about a network of smaller producers
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.200]   working together with shared values.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   And it's true that there's a limit on regenerative farming
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.920]   in that it requires more human knowledge.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.440]   So regenerative farming is more difficult to scale
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.960]   in a single operation.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.880]   It'd be really challenging to have a regenerative farm
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.960]   that was like 200,000 acres
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.200]   because of the amount of manpower needed to pay attention.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.240]   - Can you first, and I apologize to interrupt,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.520]   but can you say what is regenerative farming?
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.560]   - Sure.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   So if you're looking at scaling regenerative farming,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:09.240]   it's a traditional system of agriculture.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.440]   Regenerative farming is how we used to farm.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.360]   We used to farm with an eye towards the longterm.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.680]   You might be on the Friedman farm
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.360]   thinking about your heirs five generations from now
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.200]   farming that same land.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.640]   Are you gonna leave that land nutritionally empty?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.240]   - No, it's a longterm thinking.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.480]   - Also in traditional ag,
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.200]   you don't have inputs that are very convenient.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.080]   You can put some chicken manure on,
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.320]   but you can't spray or dump something
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.800]   that massively increases the growing potential of the land.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.720]   That was not available until the past 60 years.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   So regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.840]   where you're increasing soil fertility through your farming.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.080]   You increase soil fertility by feeding the soil.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.520]   You feed the soil through carbon.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.280]   That's why regenerative farming
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.360]   is better for the environment.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.560]   It sequesters carbon and puts carbon into the soil.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.200]   Now it's interesting.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.120]   Plants need carbon and put it into the soil
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.880]   when they're going through growth.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.120]   So if you have a beautiful field of grass
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.600]   that's just waving in the wind,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.720]   that's not sequestering as much carbon
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.600]   as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.440]   Plants that have been damaged and are regrowing
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.360]   are repairing and they're doing that by drawing down carbon
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.120]   as one of the nutrients that feeds them.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.320]   To damage the plants effectively,
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.840]   that's what we're doing with regenerative grazing.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.680]   So the cows or lambs or whatever out there,
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.560]   they're eating and taking the grass down
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.680]   and that then cause a regrowth cycle that sequesters carbon.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.600]   There's a limit to it.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.440]   There's an edge.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.800]   'Cause if those plants are so damaged
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.600]   that they can't regrow, then it turns into a dirt patch
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.200]   and that doesn't sequester any carbon.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   So it's a balance.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.280]   How do you find that balance?
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.400]   That has to do with the frequency and the scale
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.960]   of the grazing, essentially?
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   Exactly.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.840]   And so you have to find the right balance
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.320]   and that connects to both the grass.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.080]   I mean, is the ultimately, the focus here
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   is on the life cycle of whatever is grazing,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.760]   whether it's cows or lambs or so on?
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.520]   That's why the scalability question.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.240]   So all that stuff that I just talked about,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.760]   like think about all the actions that that requires.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.520]   Somebody's out there looking and paying attention
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.560]   and understanding how far the grass is,
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.000]   remembering what happened in that field last year.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.400]   There's a huge human intelligence need
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   and human kind of availability of attention.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.840]   Now, industrial farming has done a great job
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.860]   at de-skilling agriculture.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.040]   Industrial farming has taken agriculture
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.420]   from being art science to being entry-level employment.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.720]   So that's the limiting factor on regen
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.560]   and that's why I think--
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.880]   It's a human intelligence piece.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.800]   Exactly.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.680]   I gotta ask, I don't know if you think
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.540]   about this kind of stuff.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.200]   I mentioned to you offline that I spent a bit of time
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.120]   with some robots and Boston Dynamics.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.720]   Do you think there's a way to use artificial intelligence
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.120]   to help the data collection?
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.840]   So automating some of the things that makes humans special,
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.760]   make some of that decision, some of that memory
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.680]   that's then utilized, converted into knowledge
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.000]   to make decisions about the crops and so on.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.560]   Is there a way AI can help, do you think?
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.520]   Totally.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.840]   I mean, that would be incredible.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.680]   That's one of the ingredients that could help
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.520]   with the regenerative farming.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.940]   There's a number of discrete decision points
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.720]   that could completely be automated as well
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.700]   in order to supplement and work with somebody,
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.680]   like a farmer in managing it,
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.280]   about the performance on land.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.640]   And a bit of that's being done right now
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.800]   with some aerial mapping,
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.920]   but that type of AI would be huge in this.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.800]   I mean, there's estimates that if the damaged
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.120]   and underutilized rangeland in the world
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.880]   was converted to regenerative agriculture
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.320]   at somewhere between like 20 and 40% of the world's carbon
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.680]   could be sequestered.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.520]   So there's a huge potential.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.860]   The problem is cultural.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.700]   We've like lost the generational thread of knowledge
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.760]   about how to do this.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.920]   It's kind of been two generations
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.160]   that haven't farmed this way.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.040]   Also, the science around it is limited
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.480]   by the scale and longevity.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.100]   So the data collection around regenerative farming
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.000]   is also limited by the fact that it's kind of piecemeal.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.080]   There's small operations that are doing it.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.200]   They're learning and developing as they go,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.680]   and they haven't been documenting it
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.500]   and doing it for too long.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.840]   Is the ethical treatment of animals
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.800]   a part of regenerative farming?
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.640]   So in the way you do things at Balcampo,
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.680]   that's a huge part.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.720]   Is that necessarily part of the life cycle?
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.120]   So like the things that you're trying to measure
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   is like the way, like not damaging the land too much,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.160]   make sure that the land is constantly healthy
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.400]   and is producing, and then the grazing process,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.360]   and also the carbon piece,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.840]   the fact that it's like carbon neutral
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.800]   or something like that.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   I mean, are all of those pieces of the regenerative farming,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.520]   or is this an extra part to your vision
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.360]   that you're thinking about?
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.160]   I think all implicit and regenerative.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.440]   I call it out separately because we are certified humane,
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.880]   which is another layer of welfare
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.600]   that has to do with density and a couple other things.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.080]   But regenerative, I mean, think about it.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.020]   If you're a cow and you're in a regenerative operation
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.120]   where the whole life cycle of the pasture
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.520]   means that you only eat the top six inches of the grass,
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.480]   and then when there's whatever, a couple inches left,
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.360]   then that field is left dormant.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.040]   That's a better experience, right?
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.120]   So just think about it kind of functionally that way.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.400]   Well, grazing period is a better experience, right?
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.560]   And that's not what's done in,
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.160]   I mean, that's the grass-fed piece, right?
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.560]   That's the other piece with,
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.320]   certified organic's amazing.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.440]   There's plenty of certifications that,
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.520]   grass-fed and finished is also great,
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.200]   but there are workarounds for those.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.360]   You can have certified organic feedlots.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.800]   You can have grass-fed and finished,
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.920]   which is an animal-fed grass seed pellet.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.040]   Those aren't things that we do here, right?
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.840]   And regenerative captures that,
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.720]   because if you're, it's like anything,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.600]   you're isolating these very specific certifications,
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.640]   it doesn't have a holistic approach.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.260]   Regenerative though, unfortunately, isn't certified yet.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.800]   We've gotten USDA approval to use that word
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.160]   based on our carbon sequestration data,
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.820]   but it's not a regulated term.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.580]   So that's kind of the mix right now
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.680]   is to figure out how to document it.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.800]   And it's not totally clear what it means
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.740]   like for pigs and chickens, which are omnivores.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.200]   It's very clear for ruminants,
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.080]   which are animals that have a rumen that eat grass.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.560]   For omnivores, which is like what we are,
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.000]   they eat primarily grain in farming operations,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.760]   and that's a little bit more complex.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.400]   So it's kind of a moving landscape,
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.840]   but regenerative as a word is the better definition
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.360]   of the whole lifecycle approach
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.120]   of letting animals and nature work together.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.920]   - Is it true that it's possible to have a farm
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:25.320]   that doesn't produce, sort of is carbon neutral?
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.560]   - We have been third party verified
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.120]   to be carbon impact negative.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.380]   So Belcampo's 25,000 acres and the animals here,
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.680]   all of the carbon, including from our shipping
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.940]   on our mail order, is all offset
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.360]   by the amount of grazing that's happening.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.160]   Also that encompasses our partner farms.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   We buy a number of live animals in from other partner farms.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   That's their impacts also incorporated in that.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.960]   - I mean, first of all, that's incredible.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.160]   And second of all, is that possible to scale?
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.520]   - I don't see why it isn't.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.640]   I mean, it's complex to scale,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.600]   but I mean, we're putting people on the moon
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.840]   and you have a robotic dog.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.680]   I mean-
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.640]   - But that's less about scale,
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.960]   that's more about innovation.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.680]   So like in many ways, what Belcampo has done
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.480]   is innovative at a small scale.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   The question is whether that innovation could be scaled.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.520]   - That's where I feel like we in the industry
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.120]   need more help.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.160]   You know, the AI piece, the intelligence,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.560]   the thinking about ways to do things differently
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.240]   is where we need more support.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.520]   And I think it's been a, you know,
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:36.520]   kind of a swing in the past couple years
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.640]   where it's like, meat's a mess, it's terrible.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.200]   So let's ditch meat and opt for these hyper-processed,
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.600]   you know, plant-based solutions.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.560]   And I am saying there's a way to make meat
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.480]   a part of the solution.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.600]   And it's gonna mean eating less of it,
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.160]   it's gonna mean paying more for it,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.480]   it's gonna mean that the farming systems
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.040]   are more complicated.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.600]   It's not the easiest path,
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.240]   but I think in the longterm, it's the better path.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.400]   And it's also better for human health.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.880]   - Can you comment on the certified humane piece?
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.280]   So how do you run a farm?
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.040]   Like, what does it mean to raise an animal
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.080]   from the beginning of its life to the end of its life
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.040]   in a way that's ethical, that's humane?
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.640]   - I think the first piece you need to just be comfortable
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.080]   with is that making an animal into meat, you know,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.680]   is something that you're comfortable with.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.880]   'Cause I think that's the biggest question, right?
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.360]   And so certified humane actually goes all the way
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.440]   through the death of the animal,
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.600]   how it's killed and handled at processing.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.640]   So I put that out there just to say,
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.480]   well, that's, you know,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.760]   this is all about producing an animal to die for meat.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.360]   And that's not necessarily,
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.400]   that's something people struggle with with the word humane.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.240]   And I understand that.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.840]   Like I have space and empathy for that.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.800]   It's a complicated decision.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.720]   And when you have to be comfortable with at the outset
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.280]   to say, this is an animal that's gonna die to feed me.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.120]   - Yeah, so we should pause on that.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.920]   'Cause I actually just two days ago read a paper
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.960]   that argued that, you know,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.640]   the killing of an animal period cannot be humane.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.840]   So it's impossible.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.400]   And so, and that's an argument,
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.920]   just like you're saying we could make.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   But if we now on the table kind of take as a starting point,
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.840]   the idea that it's possible to kill an animal for food
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.800]   in an ethical way, if we take that as a starting point.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.400]   So we won't argue about that.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.520]   It is worth arguing about it elsewhere.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.760]   And it probably will.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.240]   I will probably talk to a few vegan folks
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   and we'll talk about the vegan diet.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.640]   I'm fascinated by it as well.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   So I'm torn in the whole thing.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.120]   But if we just take that as a starting point,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:45.360]   what then is an ethical humane way to treat an animal?
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.280]   - I look at ethical humane animal treatment
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.400]   as the major phases of life.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   So conception, birth and mothering, diet.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.040]   Those are kind of the major touch points of life.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.040]   So what we're looking at is evolutionary approach,
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.520]   which means is the animal eating
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   what it evolved to eat primarily?
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.520]   Is the animal primarily outdoors,
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.160]   which is how all animals evolved,
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.200]   given when the climate's appropriate for it.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.560]   There are certain times when you can't have animals
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.400]   fully outdoors, like here on our ranch,
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.360]   we have had issues with cold weather and things.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.920]   But so if you have appropriate weather conditions,
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.680]   is the animal outdoors?
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.160]   Is the animal able to nurture and engage with its young?
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.760]   Those are the kind of key touch points,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.640]   but it's really the birth of it.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.640]   Let me start this one from the scratch.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.600]   - Sure.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.400]   - Okay, so when I'm looking at,
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.160]   or when I consider what's humane,
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.920]   setting aside the death part,
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.500]   I look at the evolutionary diet,
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.160]   access to the outdoors,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:59.520]   and ideally spending the majority of its life outdoors.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.300]   Low density, so animals spread out,
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:07.320]   and engagement with young, social interactions.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.160]   And that's all kind of--
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.600]   - Social interaction is the cool one.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   I mean, I also read an article that like,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.840]   there's like cows, for example, have social,
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.560]   like they have friends.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.800]   - That's fascinating.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.640]   I mean, that piece with the young,
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.680]   social interaction with young,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.600]   social interaction with each other,
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.400]   that at a basic level,
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.080]   I'm sure that interaction is not as rich as humans,
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.680]   but that piece seems to be part of the humane picture.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.280]   And you said also just a quick comment,
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.800]   evolutionary diet,
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:40.120]   meaning the diet that they were evolved to have.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.720]   - And that's pretty simple.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.960]   You can look at the physiology of the animal
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.160]   and figure that out.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.680]   So ruminant species are lamb, goats, and beef,
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.960]   and they have five stomachs.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:55.160]   They evolved eating really low calorie, high fiber foods.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.680]   That's why they've got all the stomachs.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.960]   They need a lot of processing.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.840]   You or I were to eat grass, we'd die in a week, right?
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.540]   Our physiology can't handle it.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.320]   Cows were built and evolved
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.720]   to eat this very low calorie, very high fiber,
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.760]   very low density food.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.720]   And they walk around slowly,
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.460]   they're moving constantly, and they're eating it.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.720]   When we put them on a corn fed diet,
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.800]   that's the opposite of their evolutionary diet
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.840]   and their systems really struggle with it.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.220]   Now, pigs and chickens are different.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.680]   Pigs and chickens are omnivores.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.680]   And pigs will happily eat chickens, for example.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.500]   Our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.340]   and eat them.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:39.400]   - And they enjoy all of it.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.640]   - They're omnivores.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.680]   So you often see, and I've seen people try to raise
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.880]   like a grass fed chicken that doesn't exist.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.000]   I mean, they need a higher, omnivores eat everything.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.400]   They're what's called monogastric.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.060]   They got one stomach.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.300]   And that one stomach needs higher density nutrients.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.640]   So in the case of chicken, if you were to do,
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.480]   look back in American history in the 1950s,
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.900]   commercial chickens took like 54 weeks
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.660]   to come to full weight.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.500]   Now it's two and a half weeks in confinement farming.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.140]   In our systems, it's like eight, 10 weeks typically.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:17.660]   So you have to give them some amount of nutrient density,
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.580]   but there's the idea that no grain,
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.740]   'cause that's a misinformation.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.700]   For any type of commercial operation, free range,
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.460]   regenerative, pastured, everything,
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.420]   you're gonna have to have a grain feed to get any type of,
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.300]   it's actually, I think for the case of chickens,
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.440]   unless you're in a place with like tons of natural seeds
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.640]   and grubs and worms and stuff to eat,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.420]   really challenging for the chicken.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.040]   So you gotta give them some high density,
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.680]   high calorie food different from that.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.600]   That's the evolutionary diet is a really key thing.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.680]   That's the fundamental thing for health.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.040]   And it's also interesting 'cause that,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.120]   the evolutionary diet ties to human health.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.080]   I've looked at the nutritional analysis
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.840]   on all of our products and it's,
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.520]   the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.880]   and lamb gets their omega three to six ratios
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.160]   the same as wild game.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.640]   So it's not like beef is really radically different
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.500]   from elk, a ruminant species, right?
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.540]   If you feed beef an evolutionary diet,
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.680]   their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat,
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.160]   has a wild ruminant.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.360]   - I got a chance to witness Neuralink,
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.880]   I don't know if you're familiar with that company,
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.160]   the brain, brain computer interfaces.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.320]   And they have, I got a chance to see it in person,
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.720]   just a bunch of pigs who had Neuralink chips implanted
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.760]   and taken out.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.000]   Those pigs are so happy with life.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.400]   I don't know, I've never seen a happier animal.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.880]   (laughs)
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.320]   I mean, 'cause they get to eat,
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.800]   'cause you were mentioning sort of diets and stuff.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.640]   They basically, pigs seem to love a lot of stuff.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.360]   They're easily made to be happy.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.680]   I don't know if you can comment on your thoughts
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   of exploring the capacity of the pig mind
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.480]   through some of this testing with Neuralink,
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.800]   whether that's exciting to you,
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.120]   whether maybe on the humane side,
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.560]   it's a little bit concerning,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.120]   if there's something to be said on sort of like,
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.360]   yeah, I don't know if it's even the ethical side,
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.840]   but just because of your connection to meat
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.120]   and to nature and understanding these living beings.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.840]   - Well, pigs are incredibly intelligent,
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.480]   so I'm not surprised that they're a subject matter
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.920]   for Neuralink.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.840]   They're smarter than dogs
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.640]   and they're empathetic and emotional.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.000]   And we'll go look at our pigs afterwards and see,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.160]   but they're kind of like joyful and exuberant
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.840]   when they're in good health.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.040]   And so that makes sense.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.640]   I'm interested and open.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   I feel that the kind of bleeding edge agriculture movement
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.240]   that I'm on the edge of in some ways,
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.240]   we're a larger operator,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.720]   but we as a movement have to,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.240]   we have to get into the game.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.920]   We have to move forward in a way that allows us to scale
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.680]   if we wanna be viable.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   So I think there has to be openness to how that can happen.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.440]   And I also think there needs to be more thoughtful
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:13.760]   and noisy data about how regenerative ranching
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.400]   can sequester carbon.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.600]   I mean, thousands of American ranches
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.640]   are selling carbon credits right now.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.760]   The data is that valid.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.080]   And they're not selling carbon credits
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:26.240]   from like grassland that just got a fence around it.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.040]   They're selling carbon credits for verified data
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.480]   from animals assisting in carbon sequestration.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.720]   So there's got to be a way to get the tech community
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.400]   involved in ways to help regenerative agriculture scale.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.760]   - In different creative ways.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.160]   And actually, that'd be interesting
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.480]   if Neuralink somehow has,
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.160]   especially 'cause Elon Musk is involved
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.080]   and Kimball Musk has his whole effort
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.040]   and appreciation of regenerative agriculture,
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.920]   that I wonder if Neuralink has a role to play.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:59.680]   Like exploring the neurobiology of the animal,
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.600]   if that somehow will create innovations
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   that lead to improved scaling of regenerative agriculture.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.160]   That'd be interesting.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.200]   But you're saying you should be open
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.040]   to all those possibilities.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.920]   - I don't know the landscape to know what.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.040]   But my sense is that it's very hard.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.840]   It's very hard.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.960]   And our farming operation to scale
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.280]   has been incredibly complex and challenging.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.400]   We now work with partner firms.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.560]   I see their operations.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.440]   They're incredibly complex.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.960]   It just seems like there's gotta be a way
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.400]   to make some of these things simpler
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.040]   and easier to share information.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.240]   I don't know what that answer is.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.760]   - What would be cool is if we can understand deeper ways
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.920]   to measure the happiness of an animal.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.600]   'Cause then we can optimize,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.240]   like certified humane could be literally
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   an optimization problem.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.520]   Just make sure, as opposed to kind of using our,
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.600]   projecting our own human values,
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.200]   actually measuring what the animal's happy doing.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.760]   That could be, so understanding the pig brain
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.920]   might help us understand pig happiness
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.560]   and reframe what it means for a happy animal.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.120]   And then maybe it's a lot easier to make a happy animal,
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.920]   to make the animal happy than we think.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.160]   And it might have to do with a variety of delicious food
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.760]   in the case of the pig.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.440]   Is there something you could say about grass-fed meat?
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.960]   Is it all, just out of my own sort of curiosity,
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.680]   whenever people say,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.320]   so grass-fed meat is better for you,
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.920]   are all grass-fed meat made the same?
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.400]   Is there a different, like, it's like the word organic.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.640]   Is there a lot of variety within that?
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.160]   Like the way Belcampo does it, others do it.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.360]   Just more color, if you could add to this whole word
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.200]   and what it means.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.160]   - Grass-fed beef has been on grass its entire life.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.320]   And you wanna look for the words 100% grass-fed
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   or grass-fed and finished.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.320]   Now, the challenge with feeding beef grass its whole life
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.980]   is that it gains weight more slowly.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.840]   Although beef didn't evolve eating corn and things,
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.880]   it can eat them.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.280]   And in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.920]   and has like a version of like an inflammatory response.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.520]   If you actually look inside the rumen
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.960]   of the animal inside the stomach,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.580]   it's like black and shiny inside
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.760]   compared to grass-fed animals,
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.600]   like green, smells like compost.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.560]   So the animals themselves,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.800]   their whole physiology is damaged by that food,
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.760]   but they also gain weight really quickly.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.940]   And they put on a lot of fats.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.700]   Like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.440]   compared to eating a bunch of greens,
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.280]   it's the same impact.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.960]   You're gonna blow up.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.440]   So the problem for grass-fed
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.120]   is getting the animals to gain weight.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.800]   They're getting a ton of exercise.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.760]   They're eating really clean, right?
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.600]   And they're super chill.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.840]   So that's different from the animals that are kept still,
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.640]   eating really nutrient dense foods
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.900]   and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.700]   So are all grass-fed meats created the same?
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.120]   The diet, yeah, nutritional profile broadly,
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.000]   but the length of time that the animal lives
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.220]   is extremely important for the flavor of the meat.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.040]   We're taking our beef to 24 to 26 months.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.880]   Conventional is around 18 months.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.600]   So I'm always looking,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.200]   if you're evaluating grass-fed animals,
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.480]   you wanna get animals
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.880]   that are typically allowed to live for longer
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.120]   'cause their flavor's gonna be better.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.780]   There's gonna be a bit more fat.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   And their omega ratios also vary very differently.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.320]   And I've seen omega ratios,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.800]   on our farm, everywhere from one to three to one to one,
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.920]   ideal is one to one game is typically one to one
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.200]   or one to two omega three to sixes.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.560]   But in operations where you don't have year round grass,
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.400]   it's more complicated.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.240]   You're feeding hay
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.160]   and you don't get that three to six ratio.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.040]   Omega threes come from green grass.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.160]   They're the fat in greens.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.220]   And so they're scarce and costly, right?
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.800]   So you can have grass-fed and finished animals
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.960]   that don't have that perfect ratio
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.120]   'cause maybe they're in a climate
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.500]   or for whatever reasons, we've had to do it too,
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.040]   during the droughts, do hay finishing.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.680]   It's not optimal, it changes the ratio,
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.600]   but so there's a little bit of variance within it.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.760]   I'd say though, the variance within grass-fed
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.240]   is still small compared to the variance
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.920]   between conventional and grass-fed, right?
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.600]   So there's definitely things to look for within it,
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.840]   but the real difference is between those two.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.840]   Also thing to notice is that it's not a verified word, okay?
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.360]   So grass-fed means animals that have been on grass
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.720]   at some point in their life.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.980]   - The way the cattle industry is in the US,
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.320]   there's segmentation.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.400]   So there's cow-calf operations.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.120]   Then those calves get sold to stocker operations,
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.360]   which raised animals in their teens basically,
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.780]   and then those get sold to feed lots.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.840]   And so those three phases,
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.520]   that first phase of the cow-calf is always on grass.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.720]   It's mother cows and mom cows are amazing.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.620]   They can thrive on anything
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.460]   and still put all their nutrients into their baby
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.760]   and their babies will be healthy.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.160]   So you never are putting mother cows
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.760]   on really premium pasture.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.160]   So it's usually just kind of like okay pasture,
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.920]   dirty, if you ever see kind of like scrubby lots
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.360]   with lots of cows and calves on,
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.760]   that's a cow-calf operation.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.040]   So there's also a loophole, unfortunately,
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.320]   where people use the term grass-fed
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.720]   and they're actually referring to animals
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.200]   that at some point in their life had grass,
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.480]   but that might be pretty far in the rear view mirror.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.760]   - So you need to look at that grass-fed and finished
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.680]   or grass-fed 100%.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.500]   - That ratio of omega-3s to 6s,
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.660]   it changes in like a week on grain.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.500]   - Wow.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.320]   - So it's radically different.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.980]   Unfortunately, it's the same thing for you and me.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.340]   You could eat clean for a month,
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.060]   you eat junk for three days, you're garbage, right?
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.220]   It's not like you can just like coast on that, right?
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.060]   We know what that's like.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.740]   Same thing for animals, our physiology changes.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.260]   Food's the number one way we interact with our environment
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.220]   and our body changes really rapidly and dramatically.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.540]   - So we know Belcampo and just the way
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.540]   sort of this regenerative farming approach of Belcampo
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.620]   and the certified humane is good for the land,
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.820]   is good for the animal.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.920]   Can you comment on ways it's good
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.240]   for the human that eats the meat?
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.720]   Is this meat better for you?
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.160]   - Yes.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.400]   And this is where, you know, the kind of focus on the joy
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.440]   and animals doing yoga and all this sort of like
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.800]   cynical stuff about this type of agriculture.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.880]   Say just like, set that aside.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.800]   You know, it really is better for your health.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.280]   It's got a better fat ratio.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.720]   It's less inflammatory.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.000]   It's got higher protein.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.500]   It's just better product.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.040]   In the case of beef, it's lower in fat
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.420]   and that fat is a better quality and it's higher
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.300]   in poultry and pork is also higher in protein.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.040]   So all the nutritionals are better.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.540]   It's got higher density of vitamins,
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.320]   got higher density of minerals.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.180]   And none of this stuff is radically different than,
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.220]   you know, it's not like it's the product is black and white,
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.660]   but every metric meaningfully is better
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.060]   in the right direction across the board.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.900]   So why wouldn't you?
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.980]   - I hesitate to take anecdotal evidence
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.420]   as like final scientific conclusions, but it does seem,
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.660]   I've eaten quite a bit of belcampo meat, for example,
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.620]   and it just, my body seems to respond,
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.500]   like is less bothered by it.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.860]   Meaning like less inflamed, I just feel better
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.300]   'cause I mostly eat a meat diet.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.860]   And it does seem to be a little bit of a difference
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.100]   what kind of meat I eat, where it comes from.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.300]   I don't know if that's my own psychology also.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.220]   I mean, there is an aspect to like,
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.100]   when you know that the meat came from a good place
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.160]   and all the ways we've defined good,
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.900]   you feel better about it.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.520]   And that has an effect, like decreased stress.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.900]   So I'm a huge believer in that,
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.260]   like outside of just nutrition,
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.780]   how you feel about the whole experience is a huge impact,
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.760]   but it does feel like the meat itself
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.340]   is actually just leading to less inflammation for me
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.940]   or like less, like the bloated feeling
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.580]   and all those negative effects that could come with me
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.500]   versus like certain other ground beef that I eat,
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:15.380]   like store-bought chicken breast or steak,
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.460]   all those kinds of things.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.220]   My body's a little bit more,
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.140]   works a little bit harder to process that food,
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:21.980]   it feels like.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.040]   I don't know if there's science to that,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.380]   but sort of anecdotally, that seems to be the case.
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.980]   - Omega-6s are a big part of that,
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:27.820]   for in the case of the beef.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.640]   You eat a lot of beef.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.860]   - Yes. - You love beef.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:33.020]   And so in a conventional beef product,
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.700]   it's a one to 30 ratio of omega-3s to sixes,
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.500]   and it can sometimes one to 20, one to 30,
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.420]   but that's the wrong direction.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:45.340]   In our beef, it's as low as one to one.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.740]   So that and the omega-6s are what's part of inflammation.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.500]   Now, the magic in animals
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.040]   is that they're incredibly efficient processors, right?
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   And in the same way that the body can protect us from,
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.540]   can process and take out tons of things
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.860]   that are toxic out of the environment,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.660]   I mean, animals' bodies can do that too.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.900]   So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.620]   Things like Roundup and stuff don't end up in the meat.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.820]   When we have antibiotics in our meat,
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.900]   we're not worried about getting like tetracycline
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.460]   from the chicken breast.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.100]   What we're worried about is
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.660]   the workers getting tetracycline,
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.300]   the chicken growing faster than it should,
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.340]   the meat being chewier and not as high quality.
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.140]   But the actual antibiotics don't,
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.300]   the animals are great at filtering that, right?
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.140]   They get that out.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.740]   So you have to think about meat not as like contamination
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.340]   of like, oh, there's gonna be some of that garbage
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.620]   they used in the farming in my meat,
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.120]   but it's the more subtle things.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.740]   It's the fat ratio, it's the protein density.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:48.700]   And there's also just, I think in my experience,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.620]   there's just more complex flavor
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.540]   and things that taste more complex.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:54.980]   This is, science backs this up.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.860]   They fill you up faster.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:01.220]   So if you're looking to limit, to eat for fullness
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.460]   but not eat as many calories,
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.420]   more complex foods are the way to do that.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.940]   And that hit, you hit your satiety,
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.180]   help you hit that satiety.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:13.640]   So things like, I mean, all the key amino acids
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.460]   that help you feel full, mostly from meat, right?
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.820]   So those are, that's part of it,
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.100]   but all meats have those.
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.820]   Then there's other kind of micronutrients
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.980]   and things around that complex flavor
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.520]   that help you feel full faster.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.580]   - Forgive me for this question,
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.140]   but it is kind of an interesting one
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.060]   that people are curious about.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.740]   What does it feel like to be a,
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.140]   or what does it take to be a woman CEO of a meat company?
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.020]   I mean, you're no longer CEO of Belcampo,
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.860]   but you did, you ran, you co-founded Belcampo,
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.500]   you ran it for many, many years.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.740]   Is there something that you could say
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.260]   in terms of challenges associated with that?
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:54.340]   And how did you personally overcome it?
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:58.300]   - So to be a female running a meat and livestock operation,
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:04.500]   I felt very alone a lot, you know, for a long time.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.700]   I felt very, like everybody waiting for me to fail
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.540]   or watching and assuming that I was like,
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.660]   just good at marketing or whatever else.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:21.660]   And so it's taken me a while to not internalize that.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:31.180]   I think the only reason I'm here
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.900]   is we have our own supply chain in Slaughterhouse.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.340]   And I think had I really been playing
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:37.300]   in the broader meat industry,
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.780]   it would have been a shorter journey.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.140]   You know, it would have been very hard to make it
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.440]   even get to this phase.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:49.660]   But I do, you know, I think the mission is my life's work.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:59.540]   The mission of cleaner ingredients that taste so amazing.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.340]   You don't need to do too much to them.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.700]   You know, I like creating food
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.700]   that's in support of good health.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.620]   - Yeah.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.060]   - And then secondary to that, it's the environment,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.580]   but I like a want healthy food to be a joy to eat, right?
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.580]   And that's, you know, creating innovation.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:23.980]   The space for this company has been about building a brand
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.260]   that people understand and is transparent
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.940]   and that people believe in,
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.780]   in an industry that's broadly perceived as pretty corrupt.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.540]   So those are the things I feel enormously proud of.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:37.300]   - So you focused on the mission and the pushback,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.900]   all the mess of the industry.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.140]   You try not to internalize it,
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:44.220]   try not to let it affect you and focus on the mission.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.220]   - You know, and it's in the joy of it.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.300]   And the part where it's gotten fun for me
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.740]   has been returning to what I love about it.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.100]   And I've only had the privilege
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.860]   of doing that pretty recently.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:59.060]   So I think for me personally, you know, starting,
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.900]   I host this, these events on the farm called meat camps,
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.980]   where I cook and teach people to cook and, you know,
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.100]   taste and talk about flavor and all the like
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.300]   sensual aspects of it that are my fire.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.060]   Like, thank goodness I did that stuff
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.500]   because otherwise it was just such a beating, you know,
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.140]   so there were parts of it where I got to feed my fire.
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.580]   And then now in the, you know, the past year,
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.740]   since resigning, I've been,
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.540]   I do all the recipe development, I shoot all the content.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.980]   I, you know, taste product,
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.780]   I'm developing all of our new products.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780]   I launched our meatballs.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.620]   I'm just about to launch our chicken meatballs,
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.460]   doing a high protein bone broth.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.060]   Like those are, that's what,
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:36.660]   why I did this was to be able to build this great product
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.940]   that I could build on.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.140]   So I'm kind of at that place now,
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.340]   but it's taken a lot longer.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.180]   And I think, you know,
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.860]   looking at the landscape of what to do in food,
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.060]   this is definitely,
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.920]   we tackled the most complicated problem.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.700]   - Well, so-
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.540]   - That I can imagine, you know,
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.020]   I did it like in the most old fashioned way.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.860]   - Yeah.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.500]   - Right, so it's been super complex.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.860]   And then I also look at it and I'm like, yeah,
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.700]   and it's been messy and it's gonna continue to be hard,
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.140]   but I'm proud of having tackled the hard problems.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.260]   - So the hard problem here
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.580]   is not in the space of technologies.
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.380]   It's in the space of bringing something that we've done
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.420]   for a long, long time in our human history
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.180]   and scaling it in the face
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.180]   of all the other economic pressures,
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.020]   like doing so successfully,
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.780]   also communicating to the rest of the world
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.640]   that this is a powerful solution.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.380]   So inspiring the rest of the world that regenerative farming,
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.980]   like running a company in this kind of way
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.180]   that's humane for animals, good for the land,
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.140]   good for people, even if it costs,
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.100]   like if there's an increased cost to the meat,
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.140]   even if you have a broader vision
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.980]   that means eating less meat overall,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.260]   that is like inspiring the world
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.820]   that this is a future we want.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.560]   And just taking that on and getting that done.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.020]   Got a chance to eat a little bit of cheese,
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.700]   which is a good opportunity
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.460]   to talk about your experience in Italy.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.740]   You spent some time, or in the South of Europe,
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.940]   I'm not sure if it was Italy.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.460]   Yeah, I lived in Italy, but.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.780]   And there's cheese involved, right?
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:18.900]   Like what did you take away from that experience,
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.620]   both as a chef and as a human being?
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.580]   I moved to Europe right after my early 20s
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.580]   and I worked as a cheese maker.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:33.900]   And I lived in really small rural farms in the countryside
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:39.460]   and I got up early and milked animals, made cheese.
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   And I got to live in a traditional agricultural society
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.420]   and learn how they ate.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.540]   So it shaped me as a cook
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.540]   because it was a chance to have incredible ingredients,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.460]   learn how to cook very simple food.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.020]   I had been immersed and thought
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.220]   that I wanted to be like a chefy chef, right?
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.580]   Because I love food and I love cooking
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.260]   and I was just drawn to that world.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.300]   But I don't like the experience
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.740]   of that sort of like fancy food experience
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.860]   is not what is exciting for me about it.
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.300]   So I loved working in that environment
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.300]   because I got to eat lunches and dinners
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.460]   and everything with the farm that I lived on
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:31.100]   and just very traditional, simple way to eat.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.060]   The other piece of it is,
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.820]   I went to high school in the 90s,
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:37.780]   child of like the low fat generation, right?
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.540]   And it was just really liberating and amazing
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.980]   to eat tons of super fatty foods
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.740]   and olive oil all over the place
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.820]   and bleak slabs of bread and salami
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.620]   and being this like vibrant health,
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.620]   like be leaner, happy, no skin stuff,
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.740]   stop getting split ends.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.380]   Like I stopped having flaky nails,
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.260]   like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life,
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.460]   including like just moodiness.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.020]   And that all just changed.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.580]   And granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.540]   and getting up with the sunlight.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:14.500]   And like there were lots of great aspects of my life as well
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.660]   that happened in that time.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.340]   But I was just immersed in this diet
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.580]   that I realized like, man, this is so simple.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.300]   And I also loved that I had like,
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.780]   you know, you'd have dinner
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.540]   and it was just like some ricotta cheese
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.900]   with some olive oil, some bread
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.980]   and like a bowl of fava beans.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.420]   I was like, that's dinner.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.620]   And it kind of broke down my assumptions too
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.940]   about like dinner always has to be this,
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.260]   you know, a protein and a vegetable
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.740]   and, you know, being more fluid and more seasonal
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.380]   was exciting for me.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.100]   So I just learned kind of a lot about
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.620]   paying attention to food, simple preparation,
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.620]   and the vibrancy of health that I personally experienced,
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.780]   kind of made me double down on that.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.340]   - Our mutual friend, Andrew Huberman,
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.860]   mentioned something offline to me
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.940]   about something involving the mob.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.260]   - Oh yeah.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.580]   - Is there something you could share
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.780]   or are people going to hurt if you share this?
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.580]   - It's far enough in the rear view mirror.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:18.580]   I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on,
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:23.700]   and this is, you know, I was all of like 21 years old
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.100]   and to get a permit to work there,
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.020]   you have to show that you have a competency
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.100]   that nobody else in Italy has.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.100]   And that competency for Anya Fernald
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.860]   at the time was cheese expert.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:36.340]   So it was like this stupid American girl
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:37.900]   being like going to the consulate.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:38.940]   So I already knew that it was like
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.060]   there was something wobbly about this organization,
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.780]   but I went to work for them.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.780]   And my boss from that time did end up in federal prison
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.780]   for corruption many years later, embezzlement primarily.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.060]   But so I was definitely in an environment
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.460]   that was answering to multiple masters.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.300]   (laughing)
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.120]   And--
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:01.960]   - It's a nice way to put it.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.780]   - It was, I couldn't have asked for a better way
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.100]   to kind of get with life
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.860]   and understand how things happen in the world though.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.540]   You know, of learning as somebody
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.660]   who tends to be super direct and not very subtle.
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.180]   It was amazing to be in this world
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   where like everybody communicates in multiple levels.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:24.980]   Like my, we're going to lunch with my boss
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.620]   with somebody we're going to do a business deal with.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:30.500]   And by the, they ordered a glass of wine
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.780]   and with that order communicated like disappointment.
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:35.620]   - Yeah.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:38.020]   - Because that the father, the person who had made that wine
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.540]   had offended that other guys.
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:40.380]   - Yeah.
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.220]   - I like that level of stuff,
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.420]   like nothing happened directly.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.500]   I'm like, what are we talking about afterwards?
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.460]   I'm like, what happened at lunch?
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.700]   It's like, oh, I just, you know,
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.820]   I told him this by ordering that, whatever,
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:48.660]   you know, that kind of thing.
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.220]   And so understanding that there's different ways
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:53.740]   of communicating, but it was also, you know,
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:56.940]   it was interesting to see.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.740]   And I think I, you know, it's kind of the struggle
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.100]   that I've lived again and again in my life.
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.540]   Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation was
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.980]   there's a very traditional cheese
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.780]   called the Ragusa cheese in Southeastern Sicily
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.780]   where I lived Ragusa.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.140]   And it was about scaling that operation.
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.220]   So it was European union money that my boss was also
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.100]   unfortunately using for other things, but fundamentally
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.540]   it was to take that, this type of very small scale cheese,
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.900]   get them exported, help them scale.
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.820]   And we did it and it was really challenging.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.180]   And I learned a lot about the safety issues
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.820]   and collaboration issues and creating groups
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.300]   of farmers for scale.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.740]   So it's kind of been doing the same thing again and again.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.300]   But Sicily, it, you know, it was also just the first place
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:44.300]   where I would regularly forage for food.
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.340]   - Yeah.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.380]   - You know, like there I'd go to friends' houses
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:50.500]   and we'd like go out and pick nettles
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.140]   or go out and pick wild asparagus.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.180]   Every season there was stuff that you would be gathering
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.900]   and that was just part of how you lived.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.500]   And it was part of your health.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.380]   So that was, I just learned a ton in that time
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   about like simple eating and really that healthy food,
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:11.340]   the simpler it is, the better, right?
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.220]   Like this sort of sense that healthy food
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.020]   isn't in a tiny package, granola bar,
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.300]   lots of labels, lots of powders.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.700]   It's like the more simple essential,
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.060]   closer to the land can actually lead to optimal health.
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.580]   - You've learned to appreciate the simplicity of food.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.020]   The beauty within the simplicity.
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.060]   - I think it's 'cause it was the first time
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:31.580]   that I had amazing food quality.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.380]   Okay, 'cause in the, where I grew up,
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.620]   there wasn't that food quality.
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.700]   Like I had some stuff from my garden
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.740]   and things that were great,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.780]   but that's the kind of place where when artichokes in season
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.700]   all of a sudden there's guys selling artichokes
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.540]   on their bicycles in the street
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.980]   and they're just fresh picked and you'd get that one thing
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:48.580]   or the torpedo onions or the,
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.700]   like, so there's a seasonality and celebration of things
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.900]   in their peak moment and you would just have that one thing.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.780]   And that was the first time I'd ever eaten in that way.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:00.380]   - You were a judge several times on Iron Chef.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.820]   How do you judge a good meal?
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:06.580]   Like what your own, other people's,
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.900]   like what rating system is good?
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.420]   - I mean, I go on experience and think about
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.940]   how many of your like most memorable fantastic meals
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.340]   are like three-star Michelin meals.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:17.940]   It's more about the experience, right?
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.620]   It's more about that slow down, who are you with?
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:23.660]   And some of our best meals are like the most simple things.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.140]   So Iron Chef, you know, those were fun experiences.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.580]   It's a lot of sous vide though.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.220]   It's a lot of sauces.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.620]   It's a lot of powders.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.300]   I mean, it's kind of like magic food.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.620]   So that's not, I mean, it's incredible to watch it
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.500]   as science, but I don't know
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.460]   if those are my most memorable meals.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:44.180]   - So the experience is how you judge a good meal
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.100]   for you personally.
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.540]   If you were a judge of the entirety of the human experience
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.700]   in terms of the culinary journey,
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.180]   that would be like the people you're eating with,
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.580]   the environment, like how you feel,
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:58.980]   the journey, the building up to that meal,
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.700]   like the whole thing, you can't separate it out.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:05.700]   - When I was learning as an apprentice cheesemaker in Greece,
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.180]   one of the best meals of my life
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.860]   is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.060]   with like a crust of cold fat on top.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.780]   So like the way that these fatty,
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:17.500]   the sheep milk can have double the percentage of fat
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.420]   than cow milk.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.380]   So like there's the yogurt and then there's this crust
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.540]   of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.580]   and you just eat like this bowl of yogurt,
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.340]   probably top five meals of my life.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:31.100]   Right, I mean, that's the simplicity,
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:31.940]   it's just the best thing.
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.500]   And it was the fact that it's in terracotta
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.820]   and I'd had this amazing day
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.780]   and all of these things come together,
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.980]   but I still remember that feeling.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.780]   And I think most of us have those like really great
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.660]   sensual memories of food
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.460]   and they're not about necessarily
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:49.380]   that one fancy over the top restaurant or something,
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.660]   it's really about the whole context of enjoyment.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.460]   - Maybe you can help me with something.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:58.400]   So I think offline said that we're both introverts a bit,
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   but I certainly find joy in repetition.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.020]   So I kind of hide away as an introvert
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.780]   and eat the same thing over and over and over again.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.860]   But at the same time,
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.980]   I had this conversation with Tyler Cohen,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.940]   who's an economist, but he's also a food critic.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:19.540]   He writes these incredible posts about different foods.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.260]   And we had this conversation
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.900]   about what his last meal would be.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.740]   If he had to choose,
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.940]   like what is the best meal he's ever eaten
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.700]   that he would want to eat?
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.140]   And he had a good answer about it,
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.780]   it had to do with experience, I think.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.340]   If for him it was a particular Mexican restaurant
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.660]   and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients,
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.940]   because of the experience,
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.660]   because of the work it took to get there
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.100]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.380]   But also made me realize,
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.900]   like when I was going home after that conversation,
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.820]   that I couldn't answer that question myself,
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.580]   like what is the best meal I've ever eaten?
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.660]   Because I really haven't experienced much.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.980]   And so it almost was like a challenge to myself.
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.860]   Like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.640]   in this life and try stuff.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.580]   And to try to see like,
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.100]   what is the best meal for me in the world?
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.420]   Like both the experience and the taste, right?
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.100]   So I was kind of wondering first,
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.180]   I'd love to ask you like what your last meal would be
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.900]   or what is the greatest meal you've ever eaten?
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.460]   But also, and you're still very young,
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.000]   and so there's still more experiences to be had, right?
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.820]   And for me, like how do you go about
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.840]   finding the best meal in the world?
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.500]   Is there a device you could give essentially?
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.340]   - There's that sense of anticipation, right?
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.940]   So if it's the best meal, I'd say for you,
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.700]   it would need to be on the heels of something
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.240]   where you'd pushed yourself with a fast
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.020]   or with an athletic event, right?
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.460]   Or something like you would be coming into it
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.220]   with a sense of anticipation because of deprivation.
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.580]   You would be hungry for it in a bigger sense of the word,
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.620]   like hungry for deep nutrition on your soul level
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.460]   and as well as your belly.
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.900]   So I'd say that you'd have to think about it
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:09.980]   as a phase of things, like multiple things.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.260]   And then I also think, you love meat, you love cheese,
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.780]   you have to have some things that come together, right?
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.200]   Like there's gotta be some specific elements
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.740]   of just your favorite flavors in that.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:23.540]   - But there could be flavors yet to be discovered.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.020]   That's a whole other thing because I just
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:29.700]   emotionally and physically feel good on meat,
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.660]   but that doesn't mean like maybe like a rice-based dish,
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.780]   like sushi or something like that.
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.420]   Or Indian cuisine where it's like sauces
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.900]   and the breads and whatever.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:42.180]   I love that stuff too.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.780]   So we're not talking about like,
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:49.700]   a meal is an experience that could be like a one night stand
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.440]   but with a piece of food, right?
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.900]   It could be a totally different
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.100]   than what actually makes you feel good
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.420]   when you eat it every day.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.560]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.460]   Completely, completely analogous.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.300]   I get that.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.220]   I mean, you also though, there's elements of comfort
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.440]   and love and those different pieces for you.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.780]   But I think you gotta look at like,
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.700]   where would you go somewhere?
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.060]   Like, would you go to a place where you could,
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.500]   you know, hike in Japan and then end up in a little place
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.740]   where you'd eat something?
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.200]   That's where I would think you are gonna have
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.460]   that magic moment.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.160]   You know, maybe someplace you go to Mongolia
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.540]   and you're in a really extreme environment
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.220]   for three or four days and then you come back
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:27.080]   and you're in a farm and you get something on the table
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.300]   that's a surprise and you're hungry.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.220]   Like that's gonna be the moment where you're
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.980]   it gonna explode in the instance of like the culinary level.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.580]   For Alex, it levels up, right?
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.620]   That's the journey for you.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.940]   It has to be, I think from understanding you,
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:43.100]   like a combination of that pushing yourself,
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.700]   anticipation and something about the--
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:46.620]   - Approvation of some sorts.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.940]   - Exactly, and the environment.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.740]   - Well, I definitely, definitely like some fasting
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.400]   is part of a great meal for me.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.640]   So like 24 hours is like the minimum.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.980]   You're more sensitive to the richness of any experience
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:04.260]   for me when I fast 24 hours.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.220]   And so that's a requirement for a good meal
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:09.020]   is 24 hour fast, I think.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.680]   It's just like, you're able to taste,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.160]   I don't know, maybe psychological,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.640]   but you're able to disassemble the various flavors
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.340]   in a meal as simple as like even a chicken breast.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.140]   There's all kinds of flavors going on
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.340]   because like when you cook a chicken breast,
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:26.940]   there's like the outside, the inside.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:29.380]   I mean, the volume of the meat tastes different
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.700]   as you eat like the different fibers.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:33.620]   And you can like tell all those differences
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.940]   as you're eating when you're fasted
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.500]   and you can appreciate that.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.760]   And of course, you're right,
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.620]   part of the journey is important.
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.860]   It makes me think like whether restaurants
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:45.820]   is the right place to explore or--
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.980]   - I'm envisioning it on a farm for you.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.300]   I'm envisioning it in a place
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.900]   that's like really into ag and food.
[01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:54.020]   You know, like even a place like Romania,
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.300]   you know, like there's incredible farms, right?
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.860]   Where it's not gonna get any like fancy restaurants there,
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.780]   but you're probably gonna have
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:03.340]   some amazing little cheeses and cured meats.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.780]   And you might go to some, you know,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.340]   have some experience and end up in a place
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.540]   with like four things on the plate
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.100]   and each of them blows your mind.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.980]   You know, like or Japan is another place like that.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:13.820]   I think Vietnam, Laos, like, I mean,
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.980]   those are countries where there's like
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.540]   these incredible niche ingredients
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.940]   and this essentialism around food.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.780]   - That's fascinating.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.780]   Or maybe it's in Russia with Putin.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.620]   That might be the best meal in the world.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.900]   - Go with him on the farm.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.620]   - Yeah, that'd be, it's hard to reproduce that.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:28.940]   If that is in fact a good meal,
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:32.420]   it'd be, you know, it's hard to get them out to the farm,
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.780]   but maybe one time, maybe the best meal.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.780]   What about you?
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.980]   - For me, like it's the ingredients
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:41.100]   that I associate with like indulgence,
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.060]   like be fresh bread with like my favorite culture butter
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.380]   on it, be food of my childhood.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.380]   I grew up in Oregon.
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:50.480]   We always had salmon and smoked salmon or salmon eggs,
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.780]   like really good salmon eggs.
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:52.620]   I love cheese.
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.460]   I love goat cheese.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.420]   I love all kinds of cheese.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.480]   There'd be cheese.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.580]   I love meat, obviously.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.060]   I'm imagining it's sort of like an abundance
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.220]   of like 10 things I love.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:02.100]   It's not a dish, you know, it's like all the yummy things.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:04.900]   - All of your indulgences on the same plate, yeah.
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:05.820]   - And there isn't like, for me,
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.100]   there's not like a big cake or something super like that.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:10.920]   It's like really yummy things that I love,
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.580]   like really fresh, crusty, delicious bread that's warm.
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:14.820]   And it's got a bunch of butter on it.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.340]   And I can put some salt on it and eat a big slab of that.
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.340]   That's just, that's where I'm at.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:20.180]   - That's funny.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:24.500]   And so meat to you is not like one of those indulgences.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.340]   - Oh, definitely.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:26.420]   That'd definitely be steak there too.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.460]   I'm just imagining not like there isn't a specific dish.
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:30.500]   It's like eight or 10 things, right?
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.020]   It's the fresh bread.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.020]   It's something like fishy, yummy.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.940]   It'd probably be really good fresh berries too.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.980]   There'd be a steak or a pork chop or something like meaty
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.500]   and delicious and savory.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.660]   There'd be some cheese,
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:46.220]   just a bunch of different things that I love to eat
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.060]   that like all kind of check boxes for me
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:49.700]   is probably what would make me happiest.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.700]   - I'm afraid of variety.
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.660]   I like the focus when you can just,
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.500]   this is all you have,
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:57.660]   the scarcity of just this is the one ingredient
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.780]   and really appreciating it.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:04.020]   Or maybe one thing, like one full complex flavor,
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:06.100]   whatever the heck that is.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.140]   It's like the distraction,
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:11.580]   the serial dating nature of having a bunch of things
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:15.020]   in a plate is, yeah.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.900]   For some reason that prevents me
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.300]   from fully enjoying any one of them.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.860]   I don't know why that is.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.940]   The more healthy way to do it is the variety.
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.860]   Your way is the healthier way to do it.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.660]   Is alcohol involved?
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:29.180]   - I don't drink very much.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.820]   I like red wine, but I just don't really,
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:35.420]   I love red wine with good food.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:40.580]   And I also co-founded a rum business.
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.820]   That's an organic rum, so I love that product.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.220]   But that's not, for me,
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:49.220]   it's like I'm more interested in the food, I'd say.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.580]   - Is there some connection
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:54.580]   between your chef life, cooking, and music?
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.260]   Does this music have a role in the experience?
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.460]   - I love artistic expression.
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:02.180]   And that's always had a role in my life
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.540]   in the same way I love to paint and draw
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.940]   and all the different things.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.100]   I was a professional musician when I lived in Sicily,
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:10.660]   by definition, technicality,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.620]   'cause I played in the municipal band.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:19.460]   So I would march around the town with all the funerals.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.380]   I get 50 euro every time I'd march in a funeral
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.220]   playing my oboe.
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:25.740]   So it's given me, I like that because I like to,
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.260]   like you were talking about going to farms,
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:30.820]   what I quested for was experience and connection
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.660]   in places where I could learn things.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.700]   That's been the through line of my learning journey.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.900]   I've learned things and sought knowledge
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:40.020]   that I can't get in any conventional learning environment.
[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.100]   And so what are the tools that let me do that?
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.620]   It was like being adaptable and comfortable
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.460]   in different cultures,
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.420]   but also having common ground points
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.300]   that allow you to connect with people.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.740]   So music's one of those things.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:56.420]   So I love music, but I also,
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:57.820]   there's any number of different, enjoy a food,
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.020]   being able to pitch in, help in the kitchen,
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.540]   play cards, like those are when you're dealing
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.740]   with getting into farming communities and stuff,
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.380]   that stuff really helps.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.420]   So I basically have cultivated tools
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.460]   that let me drop into places where I can learn.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.180]   And so those are all kind of a piece.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.980]   - Those are just tools to get in there.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.340]   That said, we did listen to some Justin Bieber earlier today.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.300]   I need to get more into him.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:23.580]   I need to understand the full complexity of the Biebs.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.580]   You're trying to achieve what hunting stands for,
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.500]   but at a much larger scale,
[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.580]   which is what kind of Bo Campo stands for.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:32.500]   But what are your thoughts on hunting as a source of meat?
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.980]   - Amazing, 100% pro hunting.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.100]   I think the reason that hunting flips the switch
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.060]   for so many people is because it's the first time
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.960]   they've had clean meat in their lives.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.780]   Okay, so I think that the hunter's journey,
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:51.180]   when people get so turned on by hunting,
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.860]   they're just like, "Oh my God, I'm never going back."
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.220]   I'm saying that's great if you've got access to that,
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.780]   or if you know the guy who'll give you the backstrap,
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:02.620]   awesome, but that's not achievable for most of us.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:04.980]   And I do think that talking to hunters
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:07.140]   about their experiences, what they love about it,
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:09.140]   many of them are just outdoorsmen.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.100]   I say that 'cause most of them are men,
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.780]   but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.140]   and being out in the wild.
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:15.900]   But a lot of them, it's 'cause of how they feel
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.220]   when they eat the meat.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:18.460]   And it's because they're eating,
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:22.100]   I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.780]   And it's in a way that is pretty inflammatory,
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.120]   not incredibly delicious.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.180]   And when you're on that extreme,
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.060]   and then you toggle to having this totally different
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:36.140]   style of product, it feels radically different in your body.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:38.380]   So of course you're like, "I'll never go back."
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.620]   So when I talk about us being on that spectrum,
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:43.020]   it's like, well, hunting, I mean,
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.740]   I can never on any commercial operation
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:49.500]   create the variety of the biodiversity of species
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.100]   that an elk gets when it's wandering around of his own.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.300]   I mean, there's no way you can do that on a farm.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.700]   So there's always gonna be that extra five or 10%
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:00.820]   that those wild animals are gonna have.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.660]   And those wild animals also fast for longer.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.340]   So they go through periods of starvation
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.740]   and that creates an even slower growth for musculature
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.780]   that's gonna create even more unique flavor
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:11.980]   and characteristics.
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:15.380]   And so that's why there's that extra in the hunted meat,
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:18.040]   but you can come a lot closer
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.700]   with regenerative traditional farming to that flavor
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.980]   and health than with any other type of farming I know.
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.540]   So that's where I see it on the spectrum.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.660]   I love that people are getting excited about game
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.660]   because it's better for your health.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.900]   It's got all the same characteristics
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.420]   as regenerative farm meat,
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.420]   and it gets people turned on to like simple, delicious food.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:46.220]   You shouldn't have to cover food with sauce
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.540]   that's got corn syrup and soy,
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:51.220]   bunch of junk in it to make it palatable.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.540]   If you gotta put sauce on your food,
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.660]   you need to look at your ingredients.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:56.980]   You need to revisit what you're starting from.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:59.700]   Because if you have to put a bunch of things
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.820]   to mask flavor onto anything you're eating,
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.820]   you're trying to basically fool your palate
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.180]   into doing what's not best for your body.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.780]   We're trying to tell our palates,
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.100]   like just make it through this plate
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.020]   so you can get the calories in,
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:13.340]   and we're masking the fact
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:15.620]   that we don't actually find it very appetizing.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.340]   So we're kind of teaching ourselves
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.340]   to overcome our instinct with food.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:24.220]   We're saying, here's this kind of bland base substrate,
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.260]   not very interesting, I'm not like sparking to it.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:29.380]   Awesome, put sugar and salt on it.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:31.460]   This up the hyper-processed flavor profile.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:32.620]   Great, done.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.380]   And then you're sparked to it.
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:35.940]   That's a very short road,
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.660]   and that's I think a lot of the health problems we have now
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.220]   is because we're masking flavors
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.100]   and basically trying to get ourselves
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.980]   to move down this path of the same way we behave
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:46.900]   around all hyper-processed foods.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:49.220]   And that gets us into a mess with our health.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.420]   So if we can get things like game
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.740]   where people love the flavor out of the gate,
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.700]   but it's natural, simple, minimally processed,
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:56.540]   that's a win.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:01.420]   It reverses that hyper-processing trend
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.940]   that we're on as a human species.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:07.060]   And that's the promise of regenerative farming,
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   that's the promise of hunting.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.740]   Obviously, the former can be scaled,
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.060]   the hunting, I think, cannot be scaled.
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.700]   But in many ways, the hunting inspires the world
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.500]   that this is the right way to eat.
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.340]   Yes.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:27.020]   And that naturally leads to then the humane farming,
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.700]   regenerative farming idea,
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:31.820]   which is this idea that hunting represents.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:32.980]   How do you scale that?
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.540]   Well, if you look at like,
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.140]   we're talking about people use
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.260]   the sort of marketing language of like happy cows
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.620]   or that kind of thing.
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.820]   If you're talking about the happiest animals,
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.140]   it's wild animals.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.380]   So if you wonder why these practices are good,
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:46.420]   talk to hunters.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.300]   You're talking about animals
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.100]   that have lived in their evolutionary capacity,
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.460]   who have played their role in the ecosystem,
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.340]   who've lived their meaning of life.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.460]   And that's a very powerfully different kind of role
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.620]   than livestock production.
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:02.940]   So I think if we can make our livestock production
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.420]   as similar to wild as possible,
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.500]   then we're a lot of steps closer.
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.420]   So you said the animals are happiest in the wild
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.500]   and that's where they find meaning.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.940]   What about us, the human animal?
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.900]   What's the meaning for us, do you think?
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:21.900]   You've monitored the life cycle of a lot of living beings.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.900]   You ever look in the mirror and think like,
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.500]   why the hell are we humans here?
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:32.140]   I mean, thriving, reducing suffering, creating goodness.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.220]   I mean, those are the things I see in animals' behavior.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.860]   They're mostly interested in reducing suffering
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.940]   and nurturing, right?
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.380]   Those are the things that I think evolutionarily.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.740]   And we humans are just clever
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.700]   and we wanna be able to try to do that
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.180]   at a bigger and bigger scale.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:55.260]   As much as possible, reduce the suffering in the world.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:58.580]   And somehow that alleviates us of our own suffering.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:59.740]   That's the Russian thing.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.020]   Life is suffering.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.940]   And somehow helping others alleviates it.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:07.420]   And come up with creative solutions to do that.
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:08.740]   That's really interesting.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:16.100]   It's almost consciousness is the thing that led to suffering
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:19.900]   but it also led to the desire to alleviate the suffering.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.060]   It's a feedback loop.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:25.460]   Consciousness creates suffering and the desire
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.380]   to alleviate it.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:30.260]   Is there yet a pretty non-linear life?
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:32.020]   Your parents were professors.
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:36.620]   You have done a lot of sort of incredible things
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:38.740]   that many would say kinda like,
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.620]   "How the hell are you gonna get this done?"
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:44.180]   Is there advice you can give to young people today?
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:45.940]   Like high school, college,
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:51.340]   about how to live a similarly non-linear crazy life
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:54.460]   and accomplish, be as successful as you have been?
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:59.300]   About whether it's just their career or life in general.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:04.020]   The greatest gifts I've been given
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:06.900]   have come from pursuing curiosity.
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:13.300]   Just trying to understand the thing you're curious about
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.940]   and allowing yourself to be curious about it
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.460]   and just going with it.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:21.460]   And also pursuing things that are like deeply joyful for me.
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:25.580]   Not what society wants but you just personally.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:27.020]   Just on your own, you're happy that you did it.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.580]   And that's something that in the times
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.100]   when I've strayed from that, my life has been harder.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:37.700]   So it's fundamentally what are we on earth to do?
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.180]   To live and thrive.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:44.180]   And so pursuing things that are curious
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:47.900]   and satisfying and interesting and joyful
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.380]   and allow me to grow.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:55.380]   So I made a number of choices to do things
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.980]   that were more complicated
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.820]   and kind of not considered cool at the time.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:05.420]   Although now it's cool to work on farms.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.460]   It wasn't when I started my career in animal agriculture.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.940]   And it was like, but just deeply interesting to me.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.260]   And I felt like there was just lots to learn.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:17.300]   And so that's been the path for me
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.900]   is like going for something that's like curious and hard
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.620]   and kind of sticking with it and being open to it.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:27.620]   And growing elements that give me joy through that.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:33.780]   So I also, for people who are starting out in their careers
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.860]   and wanna do something different too,
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.540]   it's like get out of your comfort.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:39.380]   Go to a place that you've got something to learn from
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.340]   and let it teach you that.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.380]   And you'll get beat up.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.300]   Like I got beat up by that experience.
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:46.140]   Like it was really hard.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:50.500]   I laugh about now working for, insistently for T's and M's.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.860]   I mean, like, and the funny experiences I had there,
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:53.700]   but it was hard.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.140]   I was lonely and I cried a lot.
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:55.980]   It was stressful.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.100]   It was like, it was hard.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:57.940]   It was really hard.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:58.760]   - When you're inside of it,
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:41:59.940]   you didn't know how it's gonna turn out.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:00.780]   You didn't know it was gonna turn out well.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:02.820]   - And I'm like, why didn't I get a job
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:04.820]   doing something that all my friends are doing?
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.660]   And I didn't speak the language.
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.340]   I had to learn foreign language and learn how to function.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:12.060]   And it like, it was very lonely and very challenging,
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:15.580]   but then that's where my resilience started to grow.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.180]   So the things I learned there
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:19.020]   ended up just being about resilience
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:23.380]   and understanding the language of subtlety in meaning.
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.360]   So that's something that's carried me through my life.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.340]   But it was a curiosity about cheese making
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:29.620]   and about like just living in a village that was there.
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:30.460]   I'm like, wouldn't it be amazing
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.220]   just to live in a really rural village?
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:33.060]   - And then you just went with it.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.500]   - And I just like, this seems incredible
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.740]   and have a place where you can, you know,
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:39.820]   and there's like, the people seem interesting,
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.660]   the food seems good.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.660]   And let's just like try this and see what I can learn.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.140]   And that, like putting yourself out of your comfort zone
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.900]   in a place where you have a chance to learn and grow
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:54.900]   is the secret because it's, you grow through discomfort.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.420]   You know, people think that you grow
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.340]   when you get into this environment
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:00.700]   where everything's like kind of sailing along,
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:03.660]   but like growth actually comes through pain.
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:05.340]   You know, it's like, you know,
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.180]   growth comes from being cut down and beat down
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:10.140]   and having to re regrow and double down.
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:13.860]   And so that kind of opportunity, you have to seek it out.
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:16.140]   You have to put yourself in the line of fire a bit.
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:18.260]   If the situation sucks,
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:21.180]   it's a sign that you might be doing something right
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.940]   in the sense that you're on the path
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:26.100]   at the end of which you'll be a better person
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.820]   if you allow yourself to grow in that way,
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:29.500]   like as opposed to resisting it,
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.420]   just going along with the journey and persevering.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:37.020]   And that ended us up in this incredible place.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.420]   This whole conversation, I'll probably overlay a video.
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:43.180]   I'm looking at a gorgeous mountain
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.420]   and it's an incredible farm.
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.260]   Thank you so much for a meal yesterday.
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260]   That was incredible.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.340]   The cheese, the fish eggs,
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.700]   just everything about this place.
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:56.180]   Looking up, you can see the stars.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.100]   The stars at night are beautiful
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.100]   and there's a peacefulness to it.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.900]   I had a pretty hard week actually,
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:05.540]   just emotionally in many ways.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.460]   And just coming here,
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.300]   it's immediately so much of it is lifted.
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.380]   So I really deeply appreciate Anya
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.980]   that you would invite me here
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.300]   and that you would have this conversation.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.220]   This was really awesome.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.420]   So thank you so much.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:18.260]   - Thank you.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:21.140]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:22.300]   with Anya Fernald.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:24.420]   And thank you to Gala Games,

[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.860]   And now let me leave you with some words
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.220]   from the ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:41.140]   "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.180]   Thank you for listening.
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.220]   I hope to see you next time.

[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:50.420]   (upbeat music)
