[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   It's great to be here with you.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.280]   I'm excited with this whole idea, I don't know about you, but in the scientific community,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.880]   in the academic community, in the professional community, that segment that works in technology
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.120]   and whatnot, you know, by the greater public, we are considered the elite, right?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.540]   That's the word we like to apply to others, but the public would apply it to many of us
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.920]   in the room.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.240]   It's important to realize that because there's an authority there that the public largely
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   can't engage with.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.720]   The whole world, the world of science, the name science, the name scientist or the word
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.540]   scientist has an authority that the public can't engage with, and we know what the implications
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.840]   of that have been throughout the world.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   So this kind of thing, to get together to actually engage in these issues, these questions,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.400]   is very important, I think, to then later get out to the public and try to find a way
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.140]   to get a voice, because those of us that are believers in Jesus Christ, our biggest challenge
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.960]   is getting a voice that is heard out there.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.120]   I'll say, before I get into my presentation, that over the last several years, with the
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.000]   whole issues of the COVID and the world shutting down and the vaccines and all of that, put
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.200]   a chink in the armor of the authority of science and scientists.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.360]   It's a great opportunity for us to then step in and clarify.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.460]   So see that as an opportunity in your own walks, in your own circles of life.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.960]   Look for those opportunities to take advantage of that.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.280]   I mean, even that is in the providence of God.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   Now, I've been given kind of a broad assignment.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   I've been asked to talk about space flight, I've been asked to relate to that a little
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.680]   bit, I've been asked to talk about scripture in a biblical worldview, I've been asked to
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.600]   talk about science, I'm going to try to put it a little bit into a historical perspective,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.900]   and then I've also been asked to give more of a personal testimony of what the Lord has
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.280]   done in my life, particularly in the last two or three decades or so.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.400]   So it's a broad assignment.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.440]   I've never done it exactly this way before, so we'll see how it goes.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.620]   I'm hoping to leave a little bit of room for questions.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.100]   I've entitled this presentation Delighting in the Studied Works of Yahweh, or of the
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.020]   Lord, if you're still in the ESV or a version similar to that.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:05.540]   I, of course, being here at TMU, I had to use Yahweh, and many of you know why that
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.540]   is.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.180]   Those of you that don't understand that little humor, you can seek it out, seek out the answer
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.820]   here in the next couple of days.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.380]   Who's familiar with Psalm 111 in a way that you recall?
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.380]   Very good.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.660]   I don't see a hand in the room.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.360]   One of my fears is, you guys all have, many of you have advanced degrees beyond what I
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.300]   have in specialty areas, so it's a little bit intimidating speaking to an audience like
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.740]   that in that way.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.660]   But Psalm 111 is kind of the theme of my presentation, and specifically verse 2, I'll read verse
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.780]   1 and verse 2.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.420]   Verse 1 says, "Praise the Lord, I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart in
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.140]   the company of the upright."
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.380]   So right there, there's a praising God in the context of the congregation.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.300]   So in the context of believers.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.900]   And then verse 2 says, "Great are the works of the Lord," or of Yahweh, "studied by all
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.420]   who delight in them."
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:29.980]   Now my assumption is that we're all in business of studying God's works, whether we know it
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.580]   or not, His works of creation, His works of provisioning His creation.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:44.060]   We would expand that to His works of providential governing of His creation.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.380]   And I would say that we, those of us that are believers in Jesus Christ, see and understand
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.980]   and grow to understand all of those works of God through the lens of being a recipient
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.460]   of His work of redemption.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.380]   And that's important for us to realize.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.060]   We see and we seek to grow in our understanding of the works of God, His works of creation,
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.980]   His works of provisioning, His creation, His works of providence in our life, and of course
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.980]   that transcends to our calling in life, which I'll get into a little bit more in the personal
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.460]   remarks at the end, through our understanding of His work of redemption in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.460]   Very important.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.300]   Very important.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.340]   That's why I want to springboard off Psalm 111 verse 2.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.980]   If you go back and read it again, it doesn't command us to study.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.740]   It doesn't command us to delight in the works of the Lord.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.600]   Those are adjectives.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.180]   Those are participles.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.180]   They're modifying.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.980]   They are saying these are studied works among delighting believers.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.700]   So in our work, if we see it through the lens of redemption, we are inclined to be continually
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.260]   studying the works of God, as Ty Dene introduced, you know, to seeing mathematics and seeing
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.260]   just the wondrous truth that is in math that discloses the work of God and His ordering
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.460]   of creation.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.060]   They become studied works, and we are delighting believers in that study.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.060]   So that's the reason.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.560]   I wanted to preface that with, that's why I put Psalm 111 verse 2 up there.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.060]   It was known historically, and I'll get into the science in a few minutes, as the scientists'
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.140]   psalm.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.700]   So I'm going to give you lots of homework challenges here.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.700]   That's one of them.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.700]   Go research that.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.780]   The scientists' psalm, Psalm 111 verse 2, and we obviously won't have time to go through
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   the whole thing.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.660]   Now, I said I'm also going to relate it to space flight and relate it to technology.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:03.300]   My experience in NASA was, took four flights to space, four opportunities to space.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.700]   The first one was in May of 2000.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.260]   It was on the space shuttle Atlantis.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.020]   And anybody here see a space shuttle launch?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.100]   Yes, yeah?
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.660]   If you ever saw a launch, it was amazing to see.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.340]   The closest you could get was three miles away.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:28.540]   So you saw the initial ignition of the solid rocket boosters six seconds after the ignition
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.060]   of the three main engines, and then you saw it lift off.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:38.820]   You saw the flash of bright light, and then, of course, 15 seconds after the initial ignition,
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.780]   that's when the sound hit you, and it shook your whole body.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.340]   I remember that your chest just shook and vibrated with the energy coming out of that.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:54.460]   Think about the technology that was involved in all of the pieces, all of the science,
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.900]   all of the components of science that was involved in putting that together.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   From the chemistry of the solid rocket motor, to the structural engineering, to the life
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:11.860]   support system keeping the crew alive once they left the habitable Earth, to the orbital
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:18.100]   mechanics to go precisely into an orbit, and then it took less than nine minutes to
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.180]   get into orbit, and then being in an orbit that was predicted well ahead of time to then
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.020]   rendezvous later with something else already in orbit.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.500]   Just think about all of that, all of the science involved in that, which is a clear demonstration
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.300]   in countless ways of God's ordering of His creative work.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:44.140]   When we lifted off, it was about four and a half million pounds of mass pushed off the
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:09:01.400]   launch pad with seven million pounds of thrust.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.100]   Most of that mass on the liftoff, as you might imagine, was fuel because it took that much
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:13.740]   energy just to get out of the gravitational well of Earth, as we like to call it.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:19.060]   First two minutes on the solid rocket booster, and the rest of the time on the three main
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.100]   engines.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.540]   But very impressive, and when you think about it in the context of what we're talking about
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:29.860]   here, it's an amazing achievement of mankind to develop something like that to get into
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.380]   orbit.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.380]   By the way, one other theme I'll try to weave into the talks is the implications of bearing
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.980]   the image of God.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.120]   Because we have the provisioned creation, as I introduced, but we also have our ability
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.780]   to extract from that creation.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.680]   And that's a big thing for us to understand, too.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.520]   You all bearing the image of God are in the business of subduing God's creation, whether
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.420]   you realize it in that context or not.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:10.260]   I want to read a quote here that kind of illustrates one example of bearing the image of God.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:17.460]   "From the rocket we shall see the huge sphere of the planet Earth, like phases of the moon.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.860]   We shall see how the sphere rotates, and how within a few hours it shows all its sides
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.860]   successively.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.920]   By the way, we orbit the Earth every 90 minutes, so 16 times a day.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.660]   And we shall observe various points on the surface of the Earth for several minutes,
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.340]   and from different sides very closely.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:41.700]   This picture is so attractive, majestic, attractive, and infinitely varied, that I wish with all
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.780]   my soul that you and I could see it."
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:55.740]   That quote was written in 1911 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who was a physicist in Russia,
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.860]   later Soviet Union.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.820]   He's considered the father of the Soviet space program.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.800]   He was a theorist, a mathematician.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.500]   So he calculated theoretically what we were then decades later able to do, which is a
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.180]   clear testimony of bearing the image of God and the capacity that we're given with that
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:23.200]   image in God's creative work, even in us, even in mankind.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.160]   Another one you may be more familiar with, "Using material ferried up by rockets, it
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.800]   would be possible to construct a space station in orbit.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.000]   The station could be provided with living quarters, laboratories, and everything needed
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.320]   for the comfort of its crew, who would be relieved and provisioned by a regular rocket
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.640]   service."
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.760]   Arthur C. Clark, a familiar name, wrote that in 1945.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:55.760]   My first flight was in 2000, and I returned to space three additional times, in 2006,
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   in 2009, in the fall into the spring of '10, and then most recently in 2016.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.960]   Each of those times, it was what we call a long-duration expeditionary flight to the
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.120]   International Space Station.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:19.440]   Sorry, we have a little construction going on in the back of the room.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.700]   Each of those flights lasted about six months.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:30.300]   Each of those flights was dedicated to a different phase of building the International Space
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   Station.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.460]   My first visit in 2000 on the space shuttle was before Expedition 1 launched.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.720]   It was two modules.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.800]   Each of them were about 40 feet in length, and we didn't have the life support systems
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.480]   on board, so it was before the permanent presence.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.880]   Then months after that, in the fall of 2000, we launched Expedition 1, and that started
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.800]   the permanent presence on board the International Space Station.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.760]   And then in 2006, I went back, launching on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.040]   Again, as I mentioned, for a duration of six months.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   We were about halfway through building the space station.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.720]   And then in 2009, I returned in the spring of '10.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.520]   We completed the assembly of the International Space Station.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.640]   Again, that was a launch on a Russian rocket, and a duration of about six months.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.800]   And then 2016, now the space station's in its full operational mode.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.360]   Another six-month stay, again launching and returning to Earth from and to Kazakhstan.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.760]   I'll come to that in a minute.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.740]   But all those experiences, we ferried material up by rockets.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.820]   We constructed a space station in orbit.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.840]   Every time we launched a crew or launched a supply ship, we returned to the space station,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.600]   as I described earlier, launching from someplace on Earth at a very precise time, pointing
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.800]   the rocket in a very precise direction, firing the engine at a very precise time, getting
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.920]   into a very precise orbit.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   And within 48 hours, 46 hours, and recently is less than six hours, rendezvousing and
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   docking with the space station, going 17,500 miles an hour, docking at 0.1 feet per second,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.960]   plus or minus about an inch.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.680]   That's a demonstration of the mathematical order in God's creation and man's ability
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.320]   to predict it and to subdue it, if you will.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.640]   We, in the course of those years, built the space station piece by piece.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.120]   It's provided with living quarters.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.560]   I had my own little phone boot size crew quarters.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.240]   And then we had a couple of galleys.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.560]   We had laboratory modules.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   We had almost everything needed for the comfort of its crew.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.160]   We couldn't get the family up there, and I couldn't beam home on the weekend.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.560]   That was one of the things I would take out of science fiction.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.900]   And we were relieved and provisioned by a regular rocket service.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:16.080]   Every few weeks or so, we would have a supply ship show up with everything we needed, to
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.280]   include things like fresh fruit, which had a few days of shelf life, but it was a special
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280]   treat.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.840]   But that's what the space station looks like today.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.600]   That's what it's looked like since 2010 or so.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.720]   Amazing achievement.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.420]   I think it's the most significant technological achievement in history.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.720]   That's my opinion.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.440]   When you consider that it was built, the first element launched in 1998, finished in 2010,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.520]   it continues to fly.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.200]   We've had 20, going on 23 years of continuous human presence in space.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.540]   It's made of components that were manufactured in different parts of the Earth.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.200]   Different countries.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:08.760]   Many of them, of course, in the US, spread around parts from at least 48 states.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.280]   You recognize you have to have political support to accomplish something like this, so you
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.480]   need something in every district, almost, to get Congress to pass it.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:25.040]   But not only that, there are major components built in Russia, and Ukraine, by the way,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:31.400]   that never had the opportunity to be integrated and tested on the ground before launch.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:38.320]   It was done with simulators, simulating interfaces, and lots of work in this international engineering
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.380]   team developing that capability, and then launching these elements from either Kazakhstan
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.200]   or the Cape in Florida, or Japan.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.320]   Japan contributed some major components.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.000]   Canada contributed a robotic arm, which was critical to assembling this thing piece by
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.460]   piece.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.840]   And the European Space Agency also provided a laboratory.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.720]   And it went together largely successfully.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.480]   We had a few hiccups along the way we had to work through, but it's been an amazing
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.720]   achievement in that regard.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:19.440]   I pray it never will become a Tower of Babel, and I don't think it has been.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:26.780]   Nonetheless, it doesn't take away from the achievement made by this international team,
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.740]   this international partnership.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:35.420]   Each person bearing the image of God, given the capacity to do it.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.860]   One reason I don't think it's a Tower of Babel is there's a lot of humility involved in something
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.260]   like this when you have people on board.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:50.140]   And historically, you've lost lives trying to achieve the goal.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:56.280]   We lost the crew of Columbia in the middle of this.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.100]   When I went back in 2006 for that first long flight, the space shuttle was still grounded,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:08.220]   and we had a crew of two on board, one Russian and me.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.500]   And our primary mission, we did a lot.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.820]   We did continue to-- we did some science even.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.180]   It is an orbiting laboratory.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.940]   But the primary mission was to keep the space station alive until we got the shuttle flying
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.180]   again.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.980]   So it brings humility to the entire team here.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.180]   We know lives are at stake.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:33.340]   We know families are at home waiting on those lives that we're trying to manage the risk
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.660]   so that the crews come back safely.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:44.860]   So anyway, amazing orbital laboratory, orbital outpost, now doing lots of science.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.620]   And I'm not going to cover any of the science.
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:52.820]   You can go online and get into that bottomless pit of a website searching all the science.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.700]   But it covers all of your areas and much more.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.900]   We're technicians up there.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.380]   We're really not-- I wouldn't call myself a scientist.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.620]   We're more like technicians in a laboratory executing the experiments and getting the
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.340]   data back in the ground.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.780]   As I said, it orbits the Earth every 90 minutes.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.100]   We're inclined to the equator at 51.6 degrees.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:17.580]   So that means we cross the equator, go up to 51.6 north latitude, cross equator 51.6
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.540]   south latitude, which means we cover most of the populated Earth.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.560]   To give you an idea on the map, we go just above the border into Canada.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.900]   We don't go quite as north as Moscow.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.940]   Moscow's above that in latitude.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:38.500]   Although you can see Moscow, you can see the Alaskan Range at an oblique angle.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:46.500]   For example, as we're crossing British Columbia, we can look north and see all the way up into
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.500]   the Alaskan Range.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.960]   And I've captured pictures from that distance.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:56.940]   You can see parts of Antarctica when you're flying over Chile, for example.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:04.280]   The orbit period is 90 minutes, as I said.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.980]   You can imagine orbital mechanics.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.420]   Every orbit, every 90 minutes, the Earth is rotating once every 24 hours.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   So every time you cross the equator, you cross about 1,500 miles, roughly, to the west of
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.380]   the previous crossing.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:24.680]   So the phasing of day-night cycles allows then, over weeks and months, to pass over
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.120]   the greater portion of the Earth in different lighting conditions, high sun angles, low
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.580]   sun angles, day, night, etc.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.880]   You watch seasons go by.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:40.180]   So it's a great vantage point to study the Earth from that place, and especially looking
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.300]   through the lens of scripture.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.720]   And just to give you a couple examples, here's a nighttime view out the window.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.340]   See the structure of the space station.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   You see the star field.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.220]   You can see the Earth down below with some city lights showing there.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:21:01.140]   And then the yellow arc is the atmosphere backlit by the sun on the other side.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.520]   Or a daytime view, the globe of the Earth.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.840]   It's absolutely incredible.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.040]   We have great photography equipment on board.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:18.000]   We've maintained the state-of-the-art Nikon professional cameras and lenses that go from
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.920]   8mm fisheye to now a 1200mm big lens, which is hard to manage on the ground but very easy
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   to manage up there.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.520]   And inertially it stabilizes it very well.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.560]   So they say I've taken almost a half a million pictures up there, and my primary motivation
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:41.340]   was to capture the image, to capture the data, to capture the view, to bring it back to the
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:47.920]   ground and to share with those on the ground.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.720]   From a professional, personal point of view, the highlight of the entire experience I would
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.400]   say is doing a spacewalk.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.560]   And by the way, don't get on your phones now to live stream it, but there's a spacewalk
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.920]   going on right now.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.840]   They're out there about two and a half hours into what will likely be a six and a half
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   or seven hour EVA, we call it extravehicular activity spacewalk.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.520]   There have been, I've lost track of the number, but on the order of 250 or more spacewalks
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.000]   that have been done in the history of the space station, assembling the space station
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.880]   piece by piece.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.460]   And now today their primary task is to upgrade the solar arrays, which of course captures
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.960]   the sun's energy to provide, to charge batteries and provide electrical power to all the systems
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   on board the space station.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.680]   But we, on a spacewalk, we go outside, planned six and a half hours, and it ends up being
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.920]   plus or minus that every time.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.080]   So it's a long day, takes about six hours just to go out the door, to get the suits
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   ready, to get yourself ready, to get the tools ready, to get in everything, to do a pre-breathe,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.520]   to wash the nitrogen out of your blood, to go down to the lower pressure.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   We're at one atmosphere inside the space station, so 14.7 PSI, we go down to 4.3 PSI, 100% oxygen
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.280]   for a spacewalk.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.120]   You can imagine inside a pressurized suit, the more pressure you have, the harder it
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.520]   is to just move your arms and your hands.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.700]   But it is definitely the highlight of the entire experience, the most challenging thing
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.920]   we do physically and mentally, because every minute is choreographed for that six and a
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   half hours.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:33.040]   And we're talking continually to mission control, and they're keeping us on the checklist and
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.560]   we're confirming the steps as we go.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.480]   But it's one thing to be inside the space station or a spacecraft and look out the window
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.560]   and have this view.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:49.160]   It's another thing to be outside, hanging on with just a fingertip control and moving
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   yourself around.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.200]   And it's hard to imagine, I know, but no gravitational force.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.040]   It's only inertial force.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.600]   So you stabilize yourself, so you learn to move slow, so you can stop as you go.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.720]   You're tethered 100% of the time, for obvious reasons.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.560]   Every tool, every piece of equipment, every bag, everything you have is tethered 100%
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:20.080]   of the time, because you don't want to lose style points and lose something out there.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:28.980]   Occasionally we've lost a wrench or something, but anyway, that's a personal, on the professional
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.040]   side, highlight.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:39.720]   As I said before, we, as believers, should grow in our appreciation and appropriation
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.800]   of these truths that we're talking about through the lens of Scripture.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.920]   So with that in mind, it was a highlight of every day if I was in the window at the time
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.280]   crossing over this part of the world.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.200]   And you recognize it, of course, as the Middle East, and in the center of the picture is
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.640]   Israel.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.160]   That's the Dead Sea right in the dead center there, with the Jordan River Valley and the
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.040]   Sea of Galilee going up and to the right.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   You got the Sinai Peninsula.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.680]   You got the Nile River Delta way up in the upper left-hand corner.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.040]   So in that one view from this orbital outpost, from our vantage point here, you can see the
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.720]   entire life of Christ, our Lord.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.840]   Of course, we understand that through the Scriptures, and I'll say it out loud just
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:35.240]   to impress it on our minds right now, He, that is, Christ, is the image of the invisible
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.480]   God, the firstborn of all creation, for by Him all things were created in heaven, on
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:47.440]   earth, visible and invisible, as recorded in Genesis 1.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.360]   Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.680]   Him and, by the way, for Him.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.880]   In our endeavors, we work for Him.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.200]   He is before all things, that is, He is eternal, and in Him all things hold together.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.920]   Now, in this audience, I can throw out right now, we know there are four fundamental forces,
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.340]   right, in our observation of the universe.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.240]   One of them is gravity.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.660]   Everybody knows about gravity.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.820]   Everybody bears the consequences if you ignore gravity, right?
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:32.960]   The second one is electromagnetic force, which is obvious in life too, I think, in many ways.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.920]   The third and the fourth one are less obvious to the general public.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:42.360]   That's the weak force and the strong force at the atomic level.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   Anybody here understand any of those forces?
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.400]   I mean, you understand them, right?
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:54.300]   You understand how they work, you understand by observation the implications of those forces.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:00.880]   We can identify them, but does anybody understand, really, why they exist?
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.560]   I would say no, right?
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.500]   Well, there's a clue, I think, right here.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:13.040]   In Him all things hold together, which gives evidence of His continual involvement, continual
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.160]   power applied to His creation.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.200]   And when I get into a little bit of the history as to why we are where we are in terms of
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:29.220]   science and the public perception of it, it has a lot to do with the history of, if you're
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.840]   familiar with theological history, the history of the philosophy of, say, deism.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   What was deism?
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.520]   In fact, many of our founding fathers were deist or maybe not actively practicing, but
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.480]   they were influenced by that philosophy.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:50.200]   Basically, in a nutshell, it's, okay, I acknowledge that God created all things, but then He kind
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.640]   of wound it up like a clock and let it go on its own.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.920]   So He backed off, He's transcendent, but He's not involved in it at all.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:05.900]   So then I have to explain everything by natural processes only, right?
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.960]   But that denies the scripture.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   He is actively involved continually with every detail.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:17.540]   I think it was R.C. Sproul that said not a single molecule is out of the control of God
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.840]   at any time.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.240]   And it's right there, but in Him all things hold together, and that is the Son of God.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:31.460]   It's trinitarian, of course, but it puts an emphasis here on Jesus Christ.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.460]   It's a humbling thing.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.720]   Psalm 8 brings humility.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.040]   When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you've
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.860]   set in place, who am I?
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.880]   What is man that you are mindful of him and the Son of man that you care for him?
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:53.080]   It's important for us in our day-to-day work to look through this lens and to recalibrate
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:01.880]   ourselves through this lens as we delight in the studied works of God.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:08.600]   We go around the earth every 90 minutes, sunset, sunrise, one of the more spectacular sights
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.080]   that we see continually over and over again.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.280]   Everyone is unique because you're seeing it with different weather patterns that are being
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.240]   silhouetted by the sun.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.920]   It happens very fast.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.760]   By the way, I'm just throwing in a few examples of pictures.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.740]   Tydene asked me to show pictures, so that's what I'm doing.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:36.680]   If you look historically at science and what we know as the age of science or the scientific
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:43.200]   revolution, there were three presuppositions, if you could summarize them.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.120]   Of course, I'm simplifying things, but three presuppositions that I'd like to highlight
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.020]   for us this weekend.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.980]   One was it presupposed a rational ordering and creation.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.680]   We've already talked about that.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.440]   There's a definite order in creation that is predictable.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:13.680]   The laws are discovered and developed, if you will, and established based on the fact
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.880]   that there's a predictable order.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   Oh, by the way, the second one there, the order is precise.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.800]   I've come to believe that the precision in God's ordering of his universe is infinite.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.520]   It's infinitely precise.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.280]   We're only limited by our ability to measure that precision.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:37.200]   Of course, we oftentimes look at things and we say, "Well, that's not very precise because
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.920]   we see all the noise around it."
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:49.200]   In that noise, each component that is producing what we perceive as noise is ordered dynamics
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.720]   that are infinitely precise.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.680]   I'm convinced of that.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.040]   We get a little bit of a taste of that.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.360]   We can predict what we need to do to develop a rocket, to launch, to rendezvous, and dock
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.500]   with the space station, as I described earlier.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.320]   We do it with a little bit of variation, of course, and a little bit of uncertainty.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.760]   We manage the risk that way.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.960]   In the final analysis, the precision that we're presented with is, I believe, infinite
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.800]   in its ordering.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   The third presupposition is there's a contingency in creation.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.840]   What do we mean by that?
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.480]   Well, some of you probably know better than I do, but basically, you can describe it as
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:43.040]   the laws that govern the universe, the creative work of God, those laws are not intrinsic.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.860]   In other words, they're not written in the fine print when we make observation.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.760]   They're not obvious to us.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.280]   They have to be searched out.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.440]   They have to be developed.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.440]   They have to be discovered.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.960]   They have to be established.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.800]   They have to be shown by experimentation.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.080]   If we think of it in that way, then it makes sense because the creative work was done by
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.880]   a lawgiver, and we see him in the context of his moral law very clearly.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.080]   We can read the Old Testament.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.940]   We see the civil laws given to the nation of Israel.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.960]   We see the moral law in the Ten Commandments.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:30.200]   We understand morality because our conscience, bearing the image of God, tells us right and
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.900]   wrong and all that, so we understand those laws, but the laws of nature are also given
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.160]   by the lawgiver.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:45.520]   So that was a presupposition in the age of science and the scientific revolution that
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:53.620]   creation was contingent, and we had to search it out to discover that contingency, and that
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:33:01.240]   resulted in what we call nature's laws, and I'll touch on that a little bit more.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.680]   In Jesus Christ, all things hold together, we already talked about.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.240]   He upholds the universe by the word of his powers, another example we can draw from Scripture
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.160]   from Hebrews chapter 1.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:19.280]   I love that Greek word upholds, and I won't go into it in detail, but the commentaries
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:29.640]   will tell us that word also has an aspect in its meaning that the upholding has a progress
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.680]   forward toward a goal, and that's pretty amazing.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   That's an amazing aspect.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:43.360]   Not only is it just sustained now, but it's sustained, it's upheld with a purpose, with
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.600]   a purpose that's still in the future, which I believe will culminate in the return of
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.820]   Jesus Christ, the establishment of the kingdom, and the eternal state.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.300]   That's the purpose of creation, and that's part of the lens that we look through when
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:08.980]   we consider our place in our little vapor, our little short period of time as we go through
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:15.060]   this life on this side of eternity, we are part of that purpose, each of us a little
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.980]   piece in God's overall purpose.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:26.700]   "Bearing his image, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   dominion."
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.800]   It's probably clear in this room that each of us are involved in the subduing of God's
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.100]   creation, as I've already talked about.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:45.680]   Let's see.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.980]   Another example of our vantage point here, just incredible beauty.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:56.860]   Many of you have seen the northern lights, they exist in the south as well, but just
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:03.940]   incredible beauty, which actually when you think about it, there's that second force
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.940]   of nature, right?
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:12.420]   At least in part, there's chemistry involved, there's other science involved, there's interactions
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.940]   that we can describe scientifically, but we also look at this and what comes to mind,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:26.380]   beauty, harmony, symmetry, all those artsy words, which are also very evident, I think,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:34.820]   in scientific world, the scientific world, a reflection of the glory of God in his creative
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.060]   work.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.380]   Another example, here's a low sun angle with the sun's reflection on an ocean and then
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.100]   varying layers of clouds.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.620]   You can think of that in terms of art, the beauty, the awesomeness, by the way, whenever
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:36:02.700]   we say awesome, we have to attribute God as the source of that concept of wondrous, awesome.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.740]   It is the creative work.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:10.380]   But we can also look and we can academically imagine the science involved here too, right?
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:18.600]   With density and humidity levels and air flows and the weather systems.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.540]   Here's another example.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:26.380]   This was just a fascinating view for me and I got to see it maybe a half a dozen times
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.060]   over the different flights.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:34.300]   They're called noctilucent clouds and they're seen over the poles periodically and I don't
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.180]   know if they exist all the time, but the lighting conditions were required to be able to get
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.700]   a view like this.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.860]   And those lighting conditions were provided in the summertime in the North Pole and in
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.460]   the wintertime in the South Pole.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:55.200]   So this one was in the summer of 2016, so it was over the North Pole, I think it was
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.460]   December or so, I'm sorry, no, no, no.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.600]   It was July of 2016.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.020]   And it's when the atmosphere over the North Pole is backlit by the sun, we're just on
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.380]   the night side of the earth.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:20.060]   And then looking up through the atmosphere, you see this phenomena, which is the research
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:27.420]   I've, if you research this on the internet, you can find a little bit of data.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.740]   It's on the order of 80 kilometers and above, so it's above the weather systems that we
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.680]   typically see.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.660]   It's also in an area of the atmosphere that we don't spend much time on, airplanes don't
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.900]   go that high, spacecraft don't go that low.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.020]   We just pass through it on a rocket.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.060]   So there's not a whole lot of direct data, but the theory is that they're ice crystals
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.620]   carried up into those altitudes.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   But not only is this just, it brings our curiosity, and it's wondrous in its own state, but it's
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.300]   a clear demonstration of that mathematical order, right.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.580]   And just in the currents of the upper atmosphere carrying these things that reflect the light
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:18.660]   the way they do, or shine the backlit the way that they do, it's a mathematical order
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.860]   in its own right.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:29.700]   A wider angle view with its own array of science, this is the island of Cuba in the foreground,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.420]   the turquoise or coral reefs.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:40.460]   Right left of center coming down from above from the horizon is the Florida Peninsula,
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.860]   which you should recognize, and you got the Florida Keys going off to the left, and all
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.020]   the turquoise to the right are the Bahamas.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.180]   Just incredibly beautiful.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:57.940]   A close-up view at my favorite coral reef in the Bahamas is right here.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:03.460]   And it's a jagged edge there because this is about, I don't know, five or six frames
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:09.180]   taken just a second apart, overlapping by 50 percent, and then stitched together just
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.700]   to get the detail.
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.540]   But it's incredibly beautiful, and we see a clear ordering of things, even at that scale,
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:25.500]   even underwater, from a vantage point we don't often see.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.020]   Sand dunes, another example.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.380]   This one's in either the Sahara or the Saudi Peninsula, I can't remember.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:38.340]   But we see an ordering there, and we know that's caused by the interaction of the wind
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.040]   and the sand on the ground.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.980]   This is my favorite picture of sand dunes in this topic.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.620]   That's what it is.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.700]   But it's a very clear illustration of mathematical order.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:00.660]   We see the near-orthogonal lines, we see large-scale and small-scale repeating patterns.
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:06.300]   You mathematicians, you're thinking you're second-order differential equations and multiple
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   of them as we sit here, I know you are.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.700]   You're thinking calculus.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:19.780]   But a clear representation of the ordering of God's creation.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:25.580]   Science, by the way, means what?
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.940]   Anybody know?
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.940]   Remember?
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.940]   Knowledge.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:36.260]   It just means knowledge.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.820]   Proverbs 1:7, you know it?
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.940]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.140]   It goes on, it says, "But fools despise wisdom and instruction."
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.260]   It's simply knowledge.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:59.780]   And the Lord has given us a capacity to seek it out and to grow in it because we bear his
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.000]   image.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.980]   Talked about the scientific revolution, the age of science.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:14.380]   Some examples you can pull, of course, Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.180]   Robert Boyle, any scuba divers in here?
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.620]   PV equals NRT, right?
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:28.760]   And you study that just to get scuba qualified so you don't, you can avoid the bends.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.020]   More known for chemistry, but we have Boyle's laws.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   We talked about it.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.260]   Isaac Newton, F equals MA.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.340]   Michael Faraday, electromagnetics.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.860]   Pasteur, we all have pasteurized milk in our refrigerator at home.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:49.140]   James Clerk Maxwell, Maxwell's equations, we've been exposed to those.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.620]   But in the textbooks as you went through school, I bet none of those textbooks acknowledged
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.620]   that they were all believers.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.580]   In fact, they were all theologians first.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.500]   And they were deeply committed to answering the call and stewarding what the Lord had
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.860]   given them.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.160]   That was what drove them.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.740]   And I believe that's what drove, in God's providence, what we call the scientific revolution.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.060]   Because they saw it through the lens of scripture.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:25.260]   We broadly speaking need to recapture that perspective.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:33.340]   We are endeavoring in our callings in life because of what the Lord has done for us and
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:40.740]   where he has put us to drive us, to give us something that we need to steward and make
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.980]   a contribution in subduing the earth.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.580]   Like these guys and others.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.740]   They were driven by their faith and their sense of moral obligation to answer their
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.940]   call to scientific endeavor.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:43:01.540]   And as I touched on earlier, they presupposed and ordered a coherent and intelligible universe
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:08.020]   that could be investigated and the laws could be discovered, those contingent laws.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:14.120]   And it was their duty to study it and subdue it.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:22.260]   To give you a little bit of a glimpse of some of these guys, Kepler in a letter to his friend,
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.700]   Michael, there in 1595, he's reflecting on his past and he said, "I wanted to become
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.300]   a theologian."
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.020]   So this is earlier in life.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.820]   "For a long time I was unhappy."
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:41.500]   And implied there is prior to him actually dedicating his time to theology.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:48.300]   He says, "Now behold, God is praised by my work, even in astronomy."
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:54.360]   That's a powerful quote, a personal quote, because it's from a personal letter.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:44:00.100]   Later there was a found prayer, "If I have been enticed into brashness by the wonderful
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:06.580]   beauty of thy works, or if I have loved my own glory among men, while advancing in work
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.940]   destined for your glory, gently and mercifully pardon me."
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.100]   This is a confession of sin, right?
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:20.220]   And finally, "Deign graciously to cause that these demonstrations may lead to thy glory
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:26.920]   and to the salvation of souls, and nowhere be an obstacle to that, amen."
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.780]   That's a very powerful prayer.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.900]   It gives us a very valuable insight into his perspective.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:42.560]   And this is Kepler, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which we're all familiar with, driven
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.460]   by his faith.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.780]   Or another one, and Maxwell's my favorite.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:54.020]   He was very young when he was charged with the design and construction of the Cavendish
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:58.020]   Laboratory at Cambridge.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   And so that was done and had big wooden entrance doors, and over those doors he had carved
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:13.620]   in Latin, Psalm 111 verse 2, "Great are the works of the Lord, studied by all who delight
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.020]   in them."
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.320]   This written prayer was found after his death, "Almighty God, who created man in thine own
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:27.780]   image and made him a living soul that he might seek after thee and have dominion over thy
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:33.500]   creatures, teach us to study the works of thy hands, that we may subdue the earth to
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:40.220]   our use and strengthen the reason for thy service, and so to receive thy blessed word
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:46.420]   that we may believe on him who thou hast sent to give us the knowledge of salvation and
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:53.580]   the remission of sins, all of which we ask in the name of the same Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:46:00.020]   Oh, that we would capture such a vision in our work, in our work in academia, in our
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.860]   work in science, in our work in industry.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   Another picture.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:11.700]   This one, I'll pause here.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:18.980]   We call that the Terminator, which is the line that separates the lit part of the earth
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.460]   from the night part of the earth.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:25.620]   The technical term, as I said, is Terminator.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.620]   This is a view out the window.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:33.420]   I was always trying to capture a good picture of the Terminator, and this is one of the
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.420]   better ones.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:42.300]   I'm going to pause here because this gives a great demonstration of the authority of
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   scripture.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:51.940]   In Job 26, which is considered the oldest book in the Bible, written before the Pentateuch.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.580]   Nobody knows exactly, but it's very old.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:00.060]   In Job 26, I'll just read verse 10, "He," that is God, and it's talking about the wondrous
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:06.660]   works of God, "He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.380]   light and darkness."
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.540]   Describing this picture.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:18.780]   Describing the view we see from the vantage point that's off the planet.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.940]   You know, anybody on the planet would not have described it that way.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:29.780]   That gives testimony to the author of scripture.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.260]   All of this brings the obvious question.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.500]   Why is this perceived conflict between science and scripture?
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.220]   Does anybody here ever get the question from somebody in the public, "How can you be a
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.140]   believer and work in the field that you work in?"
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.620]   You get that?
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.620]   We're all very familiar with this perception that's out there.
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.760]   Why the hostility?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.780]   And the hostility comes from the scientific community, right?
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:03.020]   The biggest public voices out there in science will direct much of their energy against Christianity
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.900]   specifically.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   The church.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   Theology.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.900]   The Bible.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.700]   Where did it come from?
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.580]   How did we get here?
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:19.620]   Well, let me, and I, there's a lot of words on this picture coming up here.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.260]   To me, and some of this may be a refresher on you, but we're all familiar with Charles
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.260]   Darwin.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   Charles Darwin right there in the middle.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.300]   So look at the underlines here where you see some names.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:34.480]   And I just threw out some few words on each one of them because this gives us a little
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.980]   bit of a glimpse into historic timeline, which I think is very helpful.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:45.740]   The bottom line is this was a very successful propaganda campaign in the late 1800s and
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.820]   into the 1900s.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.820]   I think it's the most significant propaganda campaign, successful propaganda campaign in
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:53.820]   modern history.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:58.420]   There's a guy by the name of James Hutton in the 1700s is when he lived.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:03.380]   He was, I put in there, largely immoral because he never got married.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.900]   He was very active with women.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.740]   He was very active with alcohol.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:16.540]   Deist, as I mentioned earlier, Deist in those days was a developing theology that said,
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.740]   okay, God created everything, but then he just backed off and let it unwind itself.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.740]   He thought religion is contrived.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.900]   He wasn't very public in it because in those days you drew a lot of attention to yourself
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.860]   if you actively spoke against Christianity or the Bible.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.100]   Remember the clergy had a big power in civil life in those days.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:43.140]   So it wasn't just the Bible itself, but it was the authority of the church.
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.600]   In large cases, the state church.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.660]   This was in Great Britain, by the way.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.180]   He promoted the idea that the earth was millions of years old.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.900]   He also suggested continuous evolution.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:01.660]   He was friends with evolutionist Erasmus Darwin, who was Charles Darwin's grandfather, who
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:10.420]   did actually a lot of work in his own lifetime as a precursor to his grandson, Charles.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:18.320]   Charles Lyell came around a generation or more later, geologist, also an antagonist
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.640]   with religion, greatly influenced by James Hutton, and he's the one that is credited
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:33.760]   with popularizing the theory of uniformitarianism, which undermines primarily the flood account
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.840]   in the Bible and says that everything happened over millions of years, hundreds of millions
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   of years.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:47.040]   And if you notice, historically, the evolution of evolution, pun intended, the timescales
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:52.680]   get longer and longer and longer because the more science that's disclosed, that's developed,
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.560]   that's discovered, it refutes the age.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:04.560]   So okay, well, let's just add more years to the timescale because then maybe it increases
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:10.280]   the probability that the evolution could actually have happened or the change in structure could
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.440]   actually happen.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.560]   Lyell's goal was not science.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.800]   It was to undermine the Bible, specifically the first 11 chapters, and he didn't do it
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   actively.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:27.360]   He did it passively or he did it indirectly, did not do it directly, just by introducing
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:33.720]   these theories of science, and science at this time was gaining an authority in the
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.960]   public side.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:43.240]   So Lyell has a big place in this historical story here.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:50.400]   Lyell was a friend of Darwin, and he actually pushed Darwin to publish the origins of the
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.400]   species.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:57.280]   Darwin, it turns out, was a little bit timid to go public, a little bit timid to even publish,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.920]   but so he was pushed in part by his friend Lyell.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:08.280]   Thomas Huxley, you've probably heard, a philosopher, greatly also influenced by Hutton.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:15.340]   He was dubbed the nickname "Darwin's Bulldog" and "Evolution's High Priest."
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.360]   He was very active publicly, very much out there.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.800]   He's kind of like some of our public figures we see if you watch the news.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.760]   They're on the news all the time.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.600]   You know, whenever they have a microphone in front of them, they're talking to us.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.360]   Darwin was kind of the same way.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.900]   He was very aggressive.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:39.000]   He didn't really buy into Darwin's theories, but it was a convenient tool to use to propagate
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.740]   his philosophy, that is, to get religion and specifically get the authority of the clergy
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:49.140]   out of the public square.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.440]   He portrayed theology and the clergy as enemies of science.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.880]   So you can see this is being developed, and it's not based on science.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.080]   It's not based on a contradiction.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:04.440]   It's based on a philosophical presupposition.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:09.020]   His major accomplishment, one of them, was getting "evolution" as a word to be classified
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:15.920]   as science, even though it had no clear, relevant scientific evidence and still doesn't.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   John Dewey, I just threw in here, I didn't have him in there originally, but I threw
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.480]   him in there because he also was a follower of Huxley, greatly influenced by all of these
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   things.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   He was a Darwinist.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:35.560]   And of course, he's known as what, the founder of the modern American educational system.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:41.880]   So he applied all of these things to that, and he was successful in that development
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   of his, what's referred to as the vision for a progressive welfare state and the secularization
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.360]   of America.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.800]   So this is kind of key to our understanding, and it's probably mostly familiar to many
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.020]   of you.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:03.000]   There's another part of that thread of history, though, that I wasn't aware of up until a
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.760]   few years ago, and this is very interesting.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   There's two guys, and you can find, you can easily research this history.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:18.280]   John William Draper, born in America, so American at birth.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.960]   Andrew Dixon White, if I recall, was born in the UK and then immigrated early in life,
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.920]   so considered also an American.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:33.040]   They were American scientists, educators, highly influenced by Huxley.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:39.400]   And others in this close circle that had its center in Oxford, Cambridge, that area, the
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:48.680]   academia world in the UK, circle of British atheists, or agnostic, as Huxley coined that
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.320]   word.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:57.360]   Draper published a book in 1874 entitled A History of the Conflict Between Religion and
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.880]   Science.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:07.320]   And in that, he posited the progressive power of science juxtaposed against the repressive
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.400]   and regressive power of religion.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.920]   Have you ever heard somebody tell you that?
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.200]   Well, Christianity is regressive.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.040]   This is where it came from, in part, anyway.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.680]   That was 1874.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:29.240]   About a decade later or more, I guess it was two decades later, White published a book,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.680]   and I'll jump back up in the middle there.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.960]   He was the founding president of Cornell University.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.880]   Cornell, if you go back, it's one of the Ivy League schools, right?
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.160]   Nobody here's from Cornell.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:48.280]   It was all of the other Ivy League schools, in general, anyway, were founded as Christian
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   academies.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.120]   And most of us are aware of that.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.200]   And then they gradually threw out the Bible, and now they're very much at the other end
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.480]   of the spectrum.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:05.120]   Cornell was founded with the mission to be, as White described, an asylum for science.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.920]   In other words, it was going to be separated from the influence of religion, Christianity
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   specific.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:15.180]   It was not going to be stretched or cut exactly to fit revealed religion.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:21.720]   Let's set it aside, and let's establish it based on these presuppositions that were evolving
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:28.640]   from Darwin and the others before him, and Thomas Huxley specifically.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:36.000]   And in 1896, he published this 800, more than 800 pages, tome entitled "A History of the
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.440]   Warfare Between Science with Theology in Christendom," with that thesis, that Christianity had always
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.960]   been at war with science, always been regressive, always held it back.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.520]   That's, by the way, where you get the term "the dark ages," which, it turns out, were
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.500]   not really dark.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:58.960]   There was advances made during that period of time, driven, again, by a biblical worldview,
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:06.140]   but has largely been kind of slipped into the shadows by the greater history world.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:11.960]   The problem with both these things, and they were published as works of history, as documented
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:18.340]   works of history, and they're well documented, if you look at the bibliography, it's extensive.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:27.500]   But then later, the history community, the academic community, examining these works
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:32.640]   a little bit closer, found out that it was all fabricated or distorted.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:41.260]   In other words, the history was made up, and it was made up to propagate this goal to get
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:51.220]   religion out of the picture, and to present it in the public's eye as antagonistic, so
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.180]   juxtaposed against science.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:01.180]   Fabricated works of history, widely rejected, especially most recently in the 1980s.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.500]   There's been some work done to re-examine it.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:11.660]   And that's the conclusion, rejected, not works of history, fallacies.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:18.180]   But that war image, as we all have witnessed in life, continues to be prevalent in the
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.320]   public eye.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.900]   So it goes back to my earlier comment.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:27.220]   This is an opportunity, since there's a chink in the armor of the authority of science,
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.300]   this is our opportunity to speak into it.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:35.460]   And it takes courage and discernment and wisdom in doing that.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:49.340]   But it's a great historic opportunity, ultimately for the gospel.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   We know this.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.820]   "Men who, by their unrighteousness, suppress the truth," Romans 1, I encourage you to go
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.060]   back and read the whole chapter.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.500]   "Scoffers will come in the last days," from 2 Peter, "with scoffing, following their own
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.500]   sinful desires.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.660]   They will say, 'Where is the promise of his coming?'
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.700]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.200]   beginning of creation."
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.560]   Scripture predicts all of this, right?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.720]   Paul writes to Timothy, "Avoid the irreverent babble and contradiction of what is falsely
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.620]   called knowledge."
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.980]   Knowledge means science.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:29.140]   I think it's the King James that says what is falsely called science.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.860]   Scripture addresses these things.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.540]   The theory of evolution became the fact of evolution.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.580]   When I was a child, it was still called a theory, still acknowledged.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.020]   But I don't think the word is used in the greater public eye anymore.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:46.380]   The church was not equipped to answer this assumed authority.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.460]   I don't have time to go into that history.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.180]   But the church was ill-equipped.
[00:59:53.180 --> 01:00:00.620]   We in the scientific community should be equipping ourselves to be driven by the theology that's
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:08.180]   in God's word, to be able to address these things as we're given opportunity.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:12.220]   Talked about John Dewey, the Bible was pushed out of education, public square, pushed out
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:19.420]   of civic discourse, pushed out of science, the Bible's authorities eclipsed by the authority
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.540]   of human reason.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.580]   The church weakened in its power to be salt and light, and the Christian faith lost its
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:32.140]   public commitment and began to retreat to private individual belief.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.340]   And we know that history.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.120]   But where shall wisdom be found?
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:46.140]   And I don't have time to go into it today and too much, but this is a profound question.
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.380]   Where's the place of understanding?
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:54.980]   One that we should review in our own minds devotionally every day, to reground us back
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:03.940]   into the Scriptures, to reestablish the reason that we see our life as a calling, given a
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.980]   mission.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.660]   It's a stewardship of opportunity of what God has given.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.140]   Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:20.420]   By the way, Psalm 111 concludes with the same idea.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.140]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:30.220]   Just as a refresher, if you follow the theme of wisdom, you see wisdom personified in Proverbs
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:40.860]   chapter 8 as beside God in the delighting in the works of God.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:48.380]   Some attribute Proverbs 8 to be a glimpse into the person of Christ.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.300]   It's a personified wisdom, but it certainly gives us insight into Christ and his work
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:01.500]   with the Father in the Trinitarian work of provisioning his creation and in the works
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.020]   of providence as well.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.640]   And then you go to 1 Corinthians chapter 1, and you see that Christ is the fulfillment
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.260]   of wisdom.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.460]   Or you go to Colossians 2, all wisdom and knowledge are found in Christ.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.300]   So it's all pointing back to Christ.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.900]   It starts with Christ and it points to Christ.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:29.300]   And devotionally, that's where we need to continually reestablish ourselves in our mission
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.860]   with what we've been given in life.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.980]   Stephen Charnock, anybody know that name?
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.660]   He was a 17th century Puritan.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:47.860]   The Existence and Attributes of God is a big, thick book on my shelf at home, which is probably
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.460]   the most well-known work of his.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:56.260]   All things in the world, one way or another, center in the usefulness for man, some to
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:03.260]   feed him, some to clothe him, some to delight him, some to instruct him, some to exercise
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:08.580]   his wit or his intelligence, and others his strength.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.860]   He saw this.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:17.980]   He saw this in a biblical worldview that God's creative work is provisioned for our benefit
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.820]   and for his glory.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:25.740]   And a major component of that provision is the ordering of God's creation.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:32.540]   Okay, now, Titania asked me to get a little bit more personal.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540]   So I'll try to do that.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:39.380]   And if I miss something, she'll have the first question.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:47.220]   In this, I became a believer prior to being accepted or picked by NASA for this job in
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.780]   the late '80s.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:59.180]   And since we're here at Master's University, I'll start by saying I came to faith primarily
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.180]   after several months of studying the Gospel of John and the letter to the Romans.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:11.220]   And it was after my wife came to faith, in a moment, after a witness of the Gospel to
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.980]   her, after over a period of days.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.740]   For me, it took several months.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.420]   Like many of you, I'm more analytical.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.000]   I wanted to understand what this was.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.300]   So it took me several months.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:26.500]   And the Lord in his graciousness brought me to faith through that process, through primarily
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.780]   those two books of the Bible.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.540]   I quickly became, I just wanted to study and learn everything I could.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.340]   So I discovered Christian radio.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:40.540]   I was listening to it continually until I discovered Grace to You.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:45.140]   And then eventually, everything else kind of started falling into lower priority.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.060]   So John really taught me the Bible through the late '80s, through the '90s.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:54.340]   It was our practice to have our young, in those days, young boys in bed by 8.30.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.440]   And Grace to You came on in Houston at 9 o'clock.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.940]   And so we would be in bed with the Bible on the lap, a notebook, and a pencil, and listen
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.020]   to Grace to You.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.780]   So he really taught me the Bible.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:13.900]   So when I was selected by NASA in 1996 for this job, I was fairly well established in
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:21.380]   my faith, and also had a good perspective on, hey, this is a, if I get this opportunity,
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.500]   this is a stewardship that's unique.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:32.160]   And I need to steward what the Lord gives me, whatever it is, that included.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:40.260]   So I went into this job with this perspective, and I could go into more detail.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.820]   There were some disappointments along the way.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.340]   I didn't get selected in the earlier years and whatnot, but I trusted in the providence
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.340]   of God.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:52.820]   One of the books that had a big influence on me was The Mystery of Providence by John
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.180]   Flavel, written also in the late 1600s.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:01.260]   And that just opened my eyes to the awe and wonder of God's providential work for every
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:07.400]   detail in every one of our lives, as is affirmed in the Scripture.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:14.140]   So I trusted in him through disappointments, through opportunities, and also had this growing
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:20.440]   acute sense of the responsibility to steward the opportunities that he gave me.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.200]   So I talked already about the spaceflights and the participation in the assembly and
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.200]   operation of the International Space Station.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.960]   Now I'm involved, although I'm threatening to retire here soon from NASA, I'm involved
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.880]   in the development of the lunar program.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.020]   We're going to go back to the moon.
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:44.600]   But all of that is through the lens of understanding of stewarding what God has given me.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.680]   Now, back story, a little bit of a back story.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.120]   And I saw the unfolding providence of God in this, and I had no idea where it was going
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.120]   to end up.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.160]   And I still don't know where it's going to end up in the future from now.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:04.480]   But I started out, I spent 27 years active in Army, Army aviation.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:12.000]   And our first assignment was in West Germany in the Cold War in the early '80s, '81 to
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   '84.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.640]   So my focus was largely on the Soviet Union as an enemy, as a potential hot war enemy,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.340]   studying all their tactics, their weapon systems, their people.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.200]   We went to Berlin from West Germany a couple of times where you had to go through Soviet
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.460]   checkpoints with official orders and whatnot.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:39.280]   So that was my exposure to Russia.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.620]   Then I get into this job, my first flights to the space station.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.000]   We are partners with Russia.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.200]   So in the late '90s, I got sent to Russia.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.560]   As an active Army colonel with free time on weekends, walking around Moscow with a camera,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.360]   taking pictures.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.040]   Notice the irony there.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.360]   I thought I would fly three or four shuttle flights and maybe go long duration on station.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:13.760]   But after the first flight, long story, but I got pulled off a shuttle flight and said,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.400]   "Hey, I need you to go to Russia to start training for Soyuz."
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.840]   And I thought, "Oh, okay."
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.760]   Just followed orders, saluted, and went on.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:32.480]   I've been to Russia 60 times, roughly, accumulated more than six years of time over those many
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.480]   trips.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:40.400]   Lots of time away from Anna Marie, in addition to being off the planet, as she likes to say.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.680]   I had to learn the language.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.120]   I was a math and science guy.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.040]   I didn't want that foreign language stuff, this humanity stuff, but I was forced to learn
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   the language.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.800]   Кто-то здесь говорит по-русски, или нет?
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800]   Да?
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   Отлично.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.660]   I had to learn, I was forced to learn the language.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.520]   I've been studying it for over 20 years.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:05.040]   I still have a lesson once a week.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.880]   And over the course of time in Moscow in the mid-2000s or late-2000s, I can't remember,
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:18.400]   I got involved with the Russian evangelical community there in Moscow and had some ministry
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.640]   opportunities with them.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.740]   And I was actually in Moscow when the MacArthur Study Bible in Russian was released.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.880]   So I went to the last session, the Q&A session with John and the staff that were over there.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.160]   That was an exciting milestone, and that opened doors there.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:43.680]   And then in about 2014 or so, I discovered through a YouTube channel a ministry in Washington
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:50.600]   State, a Slavic immigrant community up there, a church, a Bible church, Word of Grace Bible
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:59.320]   Church, по-русски, Слово Благодати, pastored by a guy by the name of Alexei Kolomiantsev,
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.120]   who went to TMS, graduated in 2002.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.240]   Turned out, in hindsight, we went back and traced, I was the graduation banquet speaker.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:13.520]   We didn't meet each other, but the Lord crossed our paths from a little distance there.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.480]   In 2014, Anna-Marie and I got invited out here to go to a GMI, a Grace Mission International
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   retreat.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.440]   So all of the missionaries from Grace Community Church were called back from their places
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.720]   in the world.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.560]   We were out in Oxnard at a beach resort there for four or five days.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:39.000]   They had asked me to speak, and for some reason, Alexei still doesn't know, they invited he
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.160]   and his wife down from Washington to join that retreat.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.920]   And I had just discovered the YouTube video of his interview, which was done in Germany,
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   as I recall.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.080]   And I thought, "Wow, I gotta meet this guy."
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:57.080]   Here in America, we got this guy with this, I'll talk a little bit about the ministry
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.780]   reach here in a second.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.360]   So within two or three weeks, we're in Oxnard at this retreat, and I gave my talk, and we
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.280]   still mingled, and we knew some of the missionaries from Italy and elsewhere, and so we were just
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.300]   having a great time of fellowship.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.600]   They asked me to do a book signing, which I agreed to, and so I'm going through people
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.880]   one at a time, visiting with them.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.720]   Alexei and his wife, Tanya, show up in that line, and he introduces himself, and I said,
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.240]   "I know who you are."
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:28.840]   And we had this great conversation, and he said at the end of the conversation, "Would
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.640]   you be willing or interested in coming up and speaking at our church?"
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   I said, "Absolutely."
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.120]   Tanya, previous to that, had said, "Let's invite Jeff to our church, let's invite him
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.560]   to our church."
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.720]   And Alexei said, "No, no, no, he's too big, he's too important, he's too busy."
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.040]   Tanya, his wife, insisted, and of course, I was eager to do that.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.360]   That started a relationship.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.180]   We would go up there average once a year from 2014 on.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:12:00.260]   We took our family up there in 2019, I think, for a family vacation.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:05.860]   And our older son, we have two sons, and his wife and family were so blown away by not
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:12.140]   only the beauty of the environment, but especially the congregational life, that we started talking
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.300]   when we got back to Houston, and we decided as a family, let's move to Washington.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   I was going to retire, we were going to move.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.540]   Then the world shut down with COVID.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.740]   We all learned how to work remotely.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:27.700]   My boss said, "Hey, would you be willing to not retire?
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.940]   Just go to Manhattan, move to Washington, and work from up there."
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:35.460]   I said, "Yeah, then I can qualify for my mortgage."
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.860]   So we did, and now we've been up there going on three years, and it's an amazing place.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:48.580]   Word of Grace Bible Church and the preaching ministry of Alexei Kolomiotsev is exactly
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:55.980]   the same mold, if you will, and parallel to Grace Community Church and Grace to You in
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.820]   the Russian-speaking world.
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.100]   I call them the John MacArthur of the Russian-speaking world.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:07.740]   We get about two million downloads a month via the internet, mostly YouTube, but other
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.860]   platforms as well.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.500]   So the Lord is doing amazing things there.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:24.180]   I could go into more detail, but I wanted to say that, based on your request, as a testimony
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:31.860]   to what I've been talking about, that in the providence of God, we are called to our stations
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:39.580]   of life, and we are to steward what we're given in those stations, however it is, however
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.660]   significant or insignificant we consider it to be.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.660]   It's a stewardship.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.660]   My story is amazing in and of itself, but it's really amazing in its illustration, and
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660]   it can impact any of us.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.660]   It should impact all of us who trust and believe in Jesus Christ.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:46.660]   Hallelujah.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:57.660]   [Applause]
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:07.660]   [Applause]
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:17.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
