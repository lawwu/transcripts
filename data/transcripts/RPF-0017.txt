[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.920]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 17.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:53.700]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.640]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.620]   For today, Thursday, July 10, 2021,
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.020]   2014.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.460]   Today's show is going to be fun.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.040]   Today, we're going to talk again about taxes.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.800]   Only unlike last week or earlier this week or whenever it was that we were talking about avoiding taxes.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.660]   Today, we're going to talk about just simply not paying them.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.320]   Should be fun.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:25.700]   Yes, you heard it right.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600]   Today, we're going to talk not about tax avoidance,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.380]   we are going to talk about tax evasion.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.100]   We're going to cross over the line.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.940]   And today's show is going to be an interview with a man named David Gross,
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.880]   who runs a site and has written a book.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.480]   He runs a site called The Picket Line.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.700]   And this is about the war tax protest movement.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   I first ran across this a year or two ago,
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560]   and I just was fascinated by some of the things that he was writing and some of the information that he had to share.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.300]   And, you know,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.860]   it's going to be kind of a
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.000]   properly radical subject.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.660]   It's going to be a properly,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.500]   I guess, edgy subject.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.520]   It's very comfortable a lot of times for us to talk about choosing not to pay the taxes through legal means.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.800]   But then you get to the point of saying,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.540]   when do you say enough is enough?
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.980]   And I'm going to choose not to pay them because of moral reasons.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.480]   And that's what this episode is going to be about.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.220]   Before we get started, just to be clear,
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520]   I find this subject really interesting.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.760]   But since I'm clearly on the record here,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.700]   I'm not a war tax protester,
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.020]   although I'm sympathetic to his position.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.920]   That's not me.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.540]   And at this point in time,
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.700]   choose to pay every dollar that I owe,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.760]   not a penny more,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.700]   choose to pay every dollar that I owe.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.860]   What you do with the information is up to you.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.440]   I do think David makes some good points.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.100]   I think you'll enjoy some of the information.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.700]   And I think that even if you are sympathetic to paying high taxes,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.360]   then I think there's still some things that are worth listening to and some tactics and tools that could be
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.120]   used to be applied to other financial situations.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.300]   This is really, in essence, kind of what I want the show to be about is,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.520]   what could you learn from those radical elements of society?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.340]   What can you learn from somebody who's taking a very non-mainstream approach to their personal finance?
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220]   I believe there's a lot that we can learn.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.640]   So stick with us for the interview.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.980]   I thank you for listening.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.800]   Tomorrow's show is going to be a Q&A.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.320]   I've put some information out on Twitter.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.120]   So tomorrow's show is going to be a Q&A.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.260]   If you are interested in asking me a question,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.200]   shoot me a tweet.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.220]   Our Twitter address is at RadicalPF or send me an email,
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.860]   Joshua at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.480]   Thank you for those of you.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Thanks so much to those of you who are listening and sharing the show.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.580]   I appreciate every single one of you.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.680]   And now let's go to the interview.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.480]   Mr. David Gross, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.060]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.160]   So I'm pretty interested in our conversation today.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.360]   And I'll set a little bit of a background for the audience that we've never spoken prior to about
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.060]   three minutes ago when I just started the recorder.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.280]   We chatted for a moment before I fired up the recorder.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.980]   But I first found your website, which is sniggle.net.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.180]   I first, and I guess you call it the picket line website.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.360]   I first found your website, I think about a year or two ago.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.140]   And I was researching some things on taxes.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.600]   And I stumbled across your site.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.060]   And it opened up a world to me that I didn't know about.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.560]   But I never, frankly, I never knew existed.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.120]   I knew it existed kind of intellectually, anecdotally.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.360]   But I never knew it existed, the world of tax resistance.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.500]   I never knew that it existed in reality with people coming together and working together
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.220]   and actively avoiding and evading and resisting taxes based upon their moral quandary.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.900]   So what I thought maybe we could start with is would you be willing to take a few minutes
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.700]   and kind of just share your story and share some of the things that have happened in your life over the years
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.900]   that have led.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.360]   That have led you through your own moral decisions to take some of the steps that you've taken.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.280]   Share that with us.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.600]   Sure.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.820]   In 2003, when the Iraq War or the American invasion of Iraq was about to start,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.260]   I was feeling really torn up about it in that I was convinced that what we were about to do as a nation
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.300]   was really reprehensible.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.580]   And yet I felt like I was not really opposed to it in a meaningful way.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.860]   I was opposed to it in a way a lot of people were.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:34.660]   Rhetorically, I was out on the street with signs and writing letters to the editor and angry blog posts and emails and the like.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.920]   So I felt like as a sort of mood, I was very much opposed to it.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.720]   But when I looked at the way I was living my life, I was going to work every day
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.680]   and a certain amount of my income was being taken away and given to the government to allow this war to happen.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.500]   I felt like if somebody were to look at me objectively, they would say that really I'm a war supporter
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.700]   because of the financial support.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.440]   The practical support that I was giving to the U.S. military.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.940]   And I decided I couldn't live with that anymore.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.800]   And it was reading Henry David Thoreau's essay on civil disobedience that finally put me over the line
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   and said I really have to put my money where my mouth is and make a practical effort to live the way my values demand.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.780]   And so what this meant for me was tax resistance.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.940]   I had to stop paying for the war that I hated.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.860]   I didn't know much about tax resistance at the time.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.540]   I was familiar.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.240]   I was familiar in a vague sort of way that there might be a movement of people out there who were doing this sort of thing.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.060]   But I hadn't been in contact with them.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.680]   I was just sort of responding to a moral imperative.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   So I went into my employer and asked if there was a way to perhaps lower my income or lower my hours in such a way that I would get below the tax line.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.660]   I didn't know where this tax line was.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.480]   I assumed it was probably somewhere around the poverty line.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.100]   So I was imagining that I was going to be engaging in a really radical change in my lifestyle, a lot of sacrifice,
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.020]   a lot of trouble.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.300]   My employer, as it turns out, was not willing to do that.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.320]   They thought it would look really suspicious to their accountants or to their tax attorney or what have you.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:15.200]   So instead, I ended up quitting my job and turning into a contractor and doing consulting work for the same company I'd been working for as an employee before.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.780]   That enabled me to regulate my income.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.620]   The next task was to figure out where this darn tax line was.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.200]   And it turns out there isn't one.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.220]   There is a tax line for.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.680]   Everybody, depending on their own circumstances.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.640]   So depending on what you do with your money, depending on how old you are, depending on whether you have kids or not, depending on whether you own a home or not.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.940]   There are all these different variables that go into figuring out where your tax line was.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:47.120]   So I had to learn a lot about the tax law and try to figure out with spreadsheets and the like what my personal tax line was.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.040]   And I was very happy to find out that it wasn't going to be the poverty line, that I was going to be able to live a fairly comfortable life.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.740]   I was going to have to be a little bit more frugal than I had been.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.380]   But it wasn't going to plunge me into some sort of desperate straits.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.480]   At the same time, I was also finding out that there was a community of people who were doing war tax resistance.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.560]   And so I could draw on a lot of the experience and traditions of this group.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.040]   And in fact, war tax resistance in the United States or in America actually goes predates the United States.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.800]   There were Quakers doing war tax resistance to Queen Anne's War back in the 16th century.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   So there was a long tradition and lineage of war tax.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.400]   And I was able to draw on that and I was able to draw on the resistance that I was walking into.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   And I could take advantage of that collected experience.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Did this come from like a religious background or just kind of a strong political repulsion of the idea behind the Iraq War?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   Or was it some kind of overarching religious background?
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   Or what was your background as far as what prompted it?
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   For me, it was not a religious thing.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:55.740]   It was I just don't like the idea of causing suffering and suffering.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.740]   And killing and the like.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.740]   And I saw the Iraq War as being something that was going to be a whole lot of that.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.740]   And not very much positive results from it.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.740]   People were claiming that there were going to be all sorts of wonderful things that were going to come out of it.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.740]   And those wonderful things seemed very speculative to me.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   And the suffering that we were going to cause seemed very concrete and obvious.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   And as history has turned out, I think that's turned out to be a good hunch.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.580]   The speculative good results of the Iraq War.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.580]   Have not really come to pass.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.580]   And the suffering certainly has.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   You know, I definitely am sympathetic towards that.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.580]   I wish I could say that I had joined you at that time.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.580]   I'm 29 years old.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   So when the Iraq War was declared, let's see, 2003, I was just graduating from high school.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:47.580]   And at that point in time, I think I was much more caught up with the political.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.580]   At the time, I didn't see through the political rhetoric.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   And I was very much, I had just become eligible to vote.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.420]   And I voted for George Bush.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.420]   And I was very excited about the mission on Iraq, as it were.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.420]   But I tell you, over the last 11 years, there's been some dramatic changes.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.420]   And I didn't quite have the prescience that you evidently had.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   But now, looking back at it, I can't even imagine how I didn't see through it.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.420]   And when you look at just the lives that are lost.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   And somehow, that's where, these days, I certainly prefer to reject a lot of the political affiliations.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.260]   Because it seems like if it's an R or a D,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   and that was my problem at that time.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260]   For me, I'm thinking, oh, okay, it's a Republican thing.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.260]   So the Republicans are good.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260]   And I'm not a Democrat.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.260]   And so then you jump on board the bandwagon.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.260]   But as the time goes forward, and it flips around, and then you have a Democrat in the White House.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   Well, then you look at something like, well, should we go to war in Syria?
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.260]   And you say, no, of course not.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260]   And since then, I've learned a lot.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.260]   I've changed a lot.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260]   And I am right there with you.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.260]   I don't see any good at all that's come out of it.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260]   I get pretty embarrassed at the fact that I didn't see it earlier.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.260]   I mean, hopefully, I get a little bit of a, not a pass, but a little bit of understanding due to my age.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260]   And hopefully, I won't repeat the same mistakes.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.260]   But I respect you for that.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.260]   I think partisanship also is, it puts a lot of blinders on people.
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260]   I certainly notice that in folks.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.260]   That they don't see the world quite as clearly if they have a strong identification,
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260]   either with the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260]   They tend to see things through a filter.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260]   And leaving that behind is a great thing.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260]   Leaving that behind is a great way of kind of opening your eyes, seeing the world in a better way.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.260]   It really is.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:35.260]   Because, I mean, these days, I feel like I'm kind of out on, I mean, I don't empathize well with either of the parties.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.260]   I have some things more in common with communists.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.260]   And I have some things more in common with anarchists.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260]   And I have some things in common with people across the way.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.260]   And to me, I found that really freeing to give up all of the politics of like the political,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260]   ideology of one side.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260]   Because then it allows you to kind of look at each issue.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260]   And you still can have a philosophy that guides you on it.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.260]   That guides you, but without just adhering to, well, this is what the party says.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260]   So this is right.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.260]   Yeah, you certainly learn a lot more about the issues if you approach them with an attitude.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.260]   If I have to decide for myself rather than what does my party think is the right thing on here.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.260]   And I'll just adhere to that.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   So then, so you started off.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]   We'll get off of the politics and back to the topic.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.260]   And I'll just go back to the politics and back to the taxes, which I guess it's inextricably tied together.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   But I'm not scared to talk about politics.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:33.260]   I've always rejected that old saying, two things you're not supposed to talk about, money and politics.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.260]   And I say, what matters more in life every day except money and politics?
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260]   We should be able to talk about those things.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260]   Not talking causes problems.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.260]   So you started by trying to get your income below the line.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.260]   And you started researching the behemoth that is the US economy.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.260]   What was the behemoth that is the US tax code?
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260]   And where did things go from there?
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:00.260]   Well, I learned that I could get under the income tax line anyway fairly easily.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260]   And that a lot of people do.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.260]   It's become kind of notorious now.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.260]   But at the time, it was just sort of an emerging fact that a lot of Americans are living under the tax line right now.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   I think currently it's around 40% of households do not pay any income tax.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.260]   So I realized I wasn't going to have to go live in a cave.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260]   I wasn't going to have to eat grubs and berries.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.260]   I was just going to have to join this large group of Americans who are already not paying income tax.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260]   So I just needed to figure out how.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   So in my case, I don't have any children.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260]   I don't own a home.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.260]   So things like mortgage interest deductions are out for me.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.260]   Child tax credit, earned income tax credit are kind of lost to me.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.260]   But I could do things like put money into a health savings account and use that as a tax deduction.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260]   Put money into an IRA and use that as a tax deduction.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260]   Spend money on tuition.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260]   And some of these things have tax credits associated with them too.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:14:06.260]   And so I set up a spreadsheet and started running some numbers to try to figure out what I could do with my money in such a way that I could earn enough money to live comfortably and yet not have to pay any of it in income tax.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:12.260]   And by jiggling the numbers around and figuring out what that value was, I could then try to hit that target.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.260]   And some years I'm more successful than others depending on which contracts I can bring in.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.260]   There have been years that have been really thin when the economic crisis hit.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.260]   I had a hard time finding any clients.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.260]   And so that year I didn't come near my number.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   But I had enough savings that I could glide through that year.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:41.260]   So by hitting this number pretty consistently from year after year since 2003, I haven't had to pay any federal income tax at all legally and by the book.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   Now, there's another tax that self-employed people are hit with.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260]   And that's the Self-Employed Contributions Act.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.260]   That's the self-employment version of FICA or the Medicare Social Security Tax.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:01.260]   And because that applies to pretty much the very first dollar you earn, there's no line you can get under for that.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.260]   So the government still is hitting me with the self-employment tax.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.260]   And so I resist that by simply not writing the check.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   So I have a sort of hybrid way of doing tax resistance.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.260]   I get below the line so I don't owe any income tax.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.260]   And I don't write the check as a way of not paying the self-employment tax.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:27.260]   So the obvious question then comes, aren't you a little bit concerned about the fact that you're on a publicly released podcast and it's going to go online and you're simply saying, "I'm choosing not to pay the tax"?
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.260]   Aren't you a little bit concerned about the consequences?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:37.260]   Well, I think the consequences are more or less the same whether I'm out here making a lot of noise on a podcast or not.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.260]   I file my returns every year so the IRS knows how much they'd like to get from me.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.260]   And they know that I don't write them the check.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:52.260]   And they write me letters with increasing amounts of bold-faced type and exclamation marks on them saying, "Could you please pay up now?"
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260]   So I'm not trying to hide from them.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:16:00.260]   And that's one of the things I kind of like about this form of activism is that it is honest and it's out in the open.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260]   I'm not being secretive about it.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260]   I don't feel like I'm living a double life.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260]   I'm simply telling them, "No, I don't want to pay for your awards.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   I don't want to pay for the actions of the government.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.260]   I've got better things I can do with my money."
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.260]   If you feel like you need to come after me, come after me.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.260]   But I'm not going to volunteer.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.260]   I'm not going to participate in what you're doing.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   So that would be kind of where I'm interested in you just talking about some of that difference a little bit.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:42.260]   Because I think where I came from in my background and probably a lot of listeners would also come from is I would trumpet loudly from the rooftops as a financial planner.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   That there's a major difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.260]   With tax avoidance just being simply doing, lowering your income below the line.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:57.260]   And tax evasion, illegally choosing not to pay those Social Security and Medicare taxes.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.260]   Choosing not to pay the self-employment taxes.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.260]   And so the tax avoidance is entirely legal.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.260]   I did an entire show on that.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260]   I believe it was earlier this week.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.260]   And talked about all of the details of it.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260]   I included a statistic.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.260]   Which, by the way, I'm not going to go into too much detail.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260]   I'm sure you haven't listened to it.
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260]   But if you're interested, there's some statistics.
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260]   I'm really fascinated by tax planning.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.260]   And there's a statistic that I read on the show from a book called "How to Pay Zero Taxes."
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260]   I'm not sure if you've read it.
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260]   It's kind of a CPA book type of thing.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.260]   I don't think so.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.260]   So if you go in the financial planning community, I'm fascinated.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260]   There's a lot of good books.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.260]   And one of the things that I want to do with the show is disseminate a lot of really good information on the topic.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.260]   But there's a book called "How to Pay Zero Taxes."
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:52.260]   And in the preface to the book, the author relates the history of people who -- relates the history of various incomes and the number of people that owed no federal income taxes.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   And off the top of my head, in 2009 were the last numbers that he cited.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:09.260]   And in 2009, there were almost -- either almost or over -- just about 20,000 people in the United States of America who made over $200,000 of income.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   And paid zero federal income taxes.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.260]   And there were -- I believe it was almost or just about 2,000 people who -- in the United States of America who made over $1 million and paid zero federal income taxes.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.260]   And there are various advanced techniques that can be put together.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.260]   And the author is a tax attorney.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.260]   He went on to write a 500-page book on it.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.260]   And it's really, really interesting.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.260]   But that's all what turns -- if you want to make a financial plan, you have to make a financial plan.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.260]   And that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.260]   I'm trying to make a financial plan.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.260]   And I'm trying to make a financial plan.

[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.260]   And I'm trying to make a financial plan.
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.260]   And I'm trying to make a financial plan.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.260]   And I'm trying to make a financial plan.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:26.260]   Well, I guess the way around, what I would say is the way around the dilemma is if you
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.820]   were really concerned with it, the only way that I can think of a way around the dilemma
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:36.860]   is that the self-employment tax is imposed on profits from your business.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:42.320]   Just like Medicare and Social Security taxes, the FICA taxes are imposed on wages that you
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   earn.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.980]   So the only way to avoid it is not to earn wages.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.260]   And so there probably are some ways.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.260]   I have to think this through.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.260]   I'm kind of just doing this on the spot.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.880]   So for example, if you did something like I build houses and you somehow could figure
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.200]   out how to build houses that you owned and those houses then you just simply then rent
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.020]   them out and you have a housing business but you're not taking any wages from your business
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.620]   and you're profiting based upon the capital appreciation, then there would be no taxes
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:17.500]   due on--no Social Security taxes, no self-employment taxes if you could avoid those.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.020]   And so theoretically, I would say that's the way I would think about it.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.640]   Theoretically, I think--theoretically, you could do something like that but you really
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:28.140]   got to really think it through and figure out what skills you would have that would
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.140]   even make that happen.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:35.140]   If I could live off capital gains, which would be nice, then that would be a wonderful way
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.380]   of doing this but I'm not in that sort of position.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.380]   Nobody left you no trust fund?
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:47.260]   I know some people have done--have converted their self-employment jobs into S-corps and
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.260]   managed to get out of some of their self-employment tax that way.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.840]   But that's only a partial solution and it's--I don't know.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.380]   It doesn't seem to have enough return on investment for me to go that route.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.380]   No, no, it wouldn't.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:06.100]   And because the reality is that the rules on S-corporation is that you have to pay a
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.580]   reasonable salary.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.180]   So you can't just--the thing you see, I think this is probably the most abused--I'm not
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.420]   an IRS agent but I just have read.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.020]   I think this is probably the most abused.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.140]   I think this is probably the most abused line in the tax code is that the rules are
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.140]   very clear.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.340]   You have to pay yourself an appropriate salary.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.360]   And so if you're going to follow the rules and you're going to make sure that you want
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:32.180]   to have a good base under you, you need to research what's an appropriate salary for
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.180]   your industry.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:39.780]   And if you're making $100,000 from profit from your business or $100,000 net profit
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:45.360]   from your business and the average salary in your business is $70,000, it is absolutely
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.780]   100% against the rules.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:52.820]   So you have to pay yourself $5,000 of wages and $95,000 of dividend profit.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.100]   So people play that game and they play it all the time but I think it's probably the
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.180]   most abused line in the tax code.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.300]   I'd have to ask an accountant to see what the IRS actually--what did they actually come
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.460]   after but it's not as simple as just setting up an S-corp is what I was trying to say.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.900]   I hear people talk about it all the time and so I had to research it and see what it was.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   I didn't see any percentage in it.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.780]   It didn't seem like it was going to work.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:18.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.780]   What would you say--and I apologize.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.460]   I cut you off earlier when you were talking about tactics.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.860]   So you've lowered your income and you went through your income.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.820]   Then what have you had to learn beyond that?
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.740]   I mean how on earth do you live in California on $18,000 a year?
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.180]   It's not very hard.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.260]   Partly as I said earlier, I don't have kids.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:41.020]   I don't have dependents that require me to have a steady income that's going to be able
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.620]   to support them through crises and things like that.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.480]   So I'm fairly self-sufficient.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.540]   I don't have debts.
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.380]   I'm worried about I'm not trying to pay off credit cards or student loans or a mortgage
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.460]   or anything like that.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.540]   The biggest issue for me is I don't have a car and that is such an expensive thing.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:03.260]   In California or anywhere else, between buying the car itself, gassing it up at today's gas
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:08.980]   prices, the maintenance on it, your insurance, the parking tickets and traffic tickets you
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.540]   inevitably get, all of these different things from owning a car are just extremely expensive
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.220]   and to me, not worth it.
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.300]   I'm in good enough shape.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.260]   I'm living in a bike-friendly enough town that it's easy for me to get around and do
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.380]   everything I need to do on my bicycle.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.680]   Weather is nice out here in California.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.980]   So for me, that's a wonderful way of reducing expenses.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.640]   I'm sure that wouldn't work for everybody but for me, that's turned out to be a really
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.300]   good thing.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:37.660]   By reducing my hours that I work, I've got a lot more time on my hands which means I
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.340]   can indulge in things like home cooking a lot more.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.900]   So I've become a good cook.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.060]   I enjoy cooking.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   I have the time to go out.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:50.400]   I go out to the farmer's markets and shop for produce and come home and prepare something
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.000]   good and look up good recipes and do the dishes afterwards.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.480]   I don't feel stressed out at the end of my day and feel like, "I don't want to do anything
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.980]   but just order some pizza from somebody and sit down and eat it and watch TV."
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.740]   I've got more energy.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.180]   So it allows me to do things like that.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.220]   By cooking my own food, doing my own shopping and all that, I'm paying much, much less and
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:14.780]   eating much better than when I was living as an urban playboy and working all day and
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.820]   coming home and saying, "I'll just go to work."
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:16.820]   I'll just go to a restaurant.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.440]   Mad Fientist: So it sounds like you're basically living the retired lifestyle without being
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   retired.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   I'm more or less semi-retired.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:33.220]   I work part-time which gives me a lot of time to do other things, to take on other hobbies,
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.220]   to live the life.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.580]   I don't want to wait until retirement time to do that.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.340]   Mad Fientist: This is one of my things.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.860]   The title of my show is called Radical Personal Finance is that it seems sometimes when you
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.580]   describe what you've just described.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:51.120]   That seems to be what many people, I wouldn't necessarily say most, but I would just say
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.700]   many people would desire that kind of lifestyle.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.400]   Now, I think that you get into the world, you got to fight on your hands if you talk
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.820]   with Americans about not having a car, but you have time to read, you have time to write,
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.840]   you have some work that keeps you engaged.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.200]   What type of work do you do and what were you doing before you started this whole thing?
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   Before I started, I was working in the software field as a technical writer and working as
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.340]   an employee for a software company.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.640]   I was working for a software company in the Bay Area.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.220]   Since then, I've been doing consulting work more or less in the same field.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:27.040]   Right now, I'm working for one major client and doing technical writing for software engineers,
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.520]   so teaching software engineers how to use software tools and libraries and things of
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.520]   that sort.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.620]   Mad Fientist: I would imagine that you find some enjoyment in the work and that it keeps
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.240]   your brain going and you just simply do as much as you need to provide your living expenses
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.100]   and then go from there.
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.940]   I don't know if it's a conspiracy or not, but I certainly sometimes wonder, "Why do
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.460]   we spend all this time just on the treadmill, the treadmill, the treadmill?"
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:58.620]   When you look at the amount of taxes that get pulled from it, I sometimes wonder if
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:05.080]   it's not all a plan, again, intentional or unintentional, if it doesn't have the effect
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.220]   of just keeping the tax machine going.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.000]   I think that's certainly part of it.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.860]   I know that I work more productively now than I did when I was working a full eight-hour
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.400]   day, five days a week.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.520]   When I'm working now, I'm sitting down at the computer and starting things and I'm fresh
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.860]   and I've got something to work on and I start doing it and I power through.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.500]   When I start lagging, when I start slacking, when my brain starts to seize up or when I
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.520]   get to a point where I'm waiting on somebody else to do something that I need to do to
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.720]   go further, I just stand up and go do something else and clock out.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:43.700]   It means that when I am on the job, I'm doing work 100 percent and I think probably I'm
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.620]   as productive now as I was when I was working.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:50.020]   I was working eight-hour days and sometimes feeling a little bit sluggish towards the
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:56.360]   end of the day or after lunch or sitting in meetings a lot, not really getting a lot out
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   of it.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.560]   I think this is the way to work.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.080]   I don't know that everybody could do it, but it's sure working well for me.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:12.380]   It would seem to me that in the world that we have today, just given the ability to do
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.380]   work from many places.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:22.740]   I mean, you could live wherever and living in a bikeable city has its advantages, but
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.280]   it would seem like even if the IRS were after you, you certainly could live in an RV and
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.200]   travel across the country.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:38.380]   With some of the advents of technology, I hope that more and more of the tax protesters
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:43.140]   are able to have an effect and maybe change some of the ways of the government.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.140]   I'd love to see that happen.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:48.020]   I see that hopefully it's probably a little easier now than it was in the past.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.820]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.840]   The fact that there's a group of people who are doing this that we can draw on.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:00.600]   There's a group called the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee at nutric.org.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:04.300]   They've got a lot of information for people who are interested in getting started.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.560]   There are lots of different ways of doing tax resistance.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.380]   The way that I'm doing it is just one of them.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.540]   So that's one of the strengths of the movement is that anybody can find a method that works
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:13.900]   well for them.
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.900]   That meets the goals that they want to meet.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.800]   That takes risks that they find are acceptable.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.160]   That has effects that they want to have.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:29.120]   So I encourage anybody who's interested in trying this, both trying a lifestyle of frugality.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.080]   I think you had the people from Early Retirement Extreme on your show at one point.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:38.480]   They've got some wonderful ideas as well about how to reorganize your life so you can step
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.760]   off the treadmill now and again.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.660]   And also for people who are interested in war tax resistance, yeah, do some research.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   Look it up.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.720]   It's not as hard as it seems and the consequences are not as dire as people can sometimes make
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   them out to be.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   You see this, I see this all over our society.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.700]   And so what I see is the constant theme.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.600]   I see the theme from retirees that I've worked with or looking for meaning they're looking
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.000]   to get off the treadmill.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.820]   I did a show, I think it was last week, about the history of retirement.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:12.000]   And the thing that I never knew until I retired, until I researched it, is that we're raised
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.420]   in this country with a, with a, you know, a lot of people who are retired.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   I'm trying to do a lot of research.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:17.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:30.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:32.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:35.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:39.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:48.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:52.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.420]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.

[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:51.420]   I certainly find some of the content that David and I discussed very challenging and very interesting.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.420]   Lots to think about.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:05:03.420]   You know, it's not often that you roll over into the moral ground where you're kind of considering the whole fabric of society and government systems and taxes and all those things.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:08.420]   I find it extremely challenging to think about, but I certainly think it's a worthy conversation.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.420]   I have to fight hard to keep from feeling like I'm out in territory where I shouldn't be.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.420]   But then again, that just shows you how deep a hold all this stuff has on us.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.420]   So I wish David well.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.420]   And I again encourage you to read his book.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.420]   It is well worth reading.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   And I think that we can all learn something from it, especially the history is fascinating.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.420]   I never had any idea about any of this history until I read his book.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.420]   So I hope that you'll check it out.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.420]   And I hope that you'll support David and what he's doing.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:37.420]   And I hope that you'll join us tomorrow for another episode of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.420]   Clearly, today is an excellent day to have a disclaimer.

[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.420]   Clearly, today is an excellent day to have a disclaimer.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.980]   I am not giving personal financial advice.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:51.320]   You shouldn't do what you're going to do based upon some guy that you hear on the Internet.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.240]   Financial decisions are very personal.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.700]   You have to look at your state and your jurisdiction.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.120]   So please do your own research and talk to a professional.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:30.100]   Thank you.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:07:00.080]   Thank you.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:30.060]   Thank you.
