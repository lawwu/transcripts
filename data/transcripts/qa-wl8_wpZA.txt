[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   What happened during World War II was that
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.480]   once the Germans started to run out of manpower,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.680]   they created foreign legion groups,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.420]   but because those people were not Aryans,
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.920]   they couldn't be trusted.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.760]   So they were put under the command of Henry Himmler,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.320]   under command of SS,
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.220]   and became known as SS Waffen units.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.540]   And one of such units was created in Ukraine.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.760]   - The following is a conversation with Serhi Plohi,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.020]   a historian at Harvard University
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.140]   and the director of the Ukrainian Research Institute,
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.600]   also at Harvard.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.220]   As a historian, he specializes in the history
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.200]   of Eastern Europe with an emphasis on Ukraine.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.900]   He wrote a lot of great books on Ukraine and Russia,
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.080]   the Soviet Union, on Slavic peoples in general
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.640]   across centuries, on Chernobyl and nuclear disasters,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.220]   and on the current war in Ukraine.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.200]   A book titled "The Russo-Ukrainian War,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.980]   "The Return of History."
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.160]   To support it, we check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.360]   And now, dear friends, here's Serhi Plohi.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.020]   What are the major explanations
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.200]   for the collapse of the Soviet Union?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.520]   Maybe ones you agree with and ones you disagree with.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.060]   - Very often, people confuse three different processes
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.320]   that were taking place in the late '80s and early '90s.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   And the one was the collapse of communism as ideology.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.240]   Another was the end of the Cold War.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.580]   And the third one was the end of the Soviet Union.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.000]   All of these processes were interrelated, interconnected.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   But when people provide ideology as the explanation
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.280]   for all of these processes, that's where I disagree.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.040]   Because ideological collapse happened on the territory
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.120]   of the Soviet Union in general.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.760]   Soviet Union lost the Cold War,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.380]   whether we are talking about Moscow,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.700]   Leningrad or St. Petersburg now, or Vladivostok.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.780]   But the fall of the Soviet Union is about a story
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.280]   in which Vladivostok and St. Petersburg
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400]   ended up in one country.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.840]   And Kiev, Minsk, and Dushanbe ended in different countries.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.520]   So the theories and explanations about how did that happen,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   for me, this really very helpful theories
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720]   for understanding the Soviet collapse.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   So the mobilization from below, the collapse of the center,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   against the background of economic collapse,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   against the background of ideological implosions,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.660]   that's how I look at the fall of the Soviet Union,
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.760]   and that's how I look at the theories
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.360]   that explain that collapse.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   - So it's a story of geography, ideology, economics,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540]   which are the most important to understand
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.540]   of what made the collapse of the Soviet Union happen?
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.280]   - The Soviet collapse was unique,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.380]   but not more unique than collapse of any other empire.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.240]   So what we really witnessed,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.380]   or the world witnessed back in 1991,
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.840]   and we continue to witness today,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.380]   with the Russian aggression against Ukraine,
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.560]   is a collapse of one of the largest world empires.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.840]   We talked about the Soviet Union,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120]   and now talk about Russia as possessing
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.760]   plus/minus one-sixth of the surface of the Earth.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.940]   You don't get in possession of one-sixth of the Earth
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.120]   by being a nation state.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.720]   You get that sort of size as an empire,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.480]   and the Soviet collapse is continuation
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.160]   of the disintegration of the Russian Empire
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.780]   that started back in 1917,
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.320]   that was arrested for some period of time
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.040]   by the Bolsheviks, by the communist ideology,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   which was internationalist ideology,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.200]   and then came back in full force
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.360]   in the late '80s and early '90s.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   So the most important story for me,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.740]   this is the story of the continuing collapse
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.940]   of the Russian Empire,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.440]   and the rise of not just local nationalism,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.620]   but also rise of Russian nationalism
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.220]   that turned out to be as a destructive force
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.220]   for the imperial or multi-ethnic, multi-national state,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.820]   as was Ukrainian nationalism, or Georgian,
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.340]   or Estonian, for that matter.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.840]   - Well, you said a lot of interesting stuff there.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.820]   1917, Bolsheviks, internationalists,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.740]   how that plays with the idea of Russian Empire and so on,
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.540]   but first let me ask about US influence on this.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.200]   So one of the ideas is that through the Cold War,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.560]   that mechanism, US had major interest
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.060]   to weaken the Soviet Union,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.440]   and therefore the collapse could be attributed
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.580]   to pressure and manipulation from the United States.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.780]   Is there truth to that?
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.100]   - The pressure from the United States,
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.100]   this is part of the Cold War.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.860]   And Cold War, part of that story,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.780]   but it doesn't explain the Soviet collapse.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.880]   And the reason is quite simple.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.860]   The United States of America didn't want
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.400]   the Soviet Union to collapse and disintegrate.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.260]   They didn't want that at the start of the Cold War in 1948,
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.260]   we now have the strategic documents.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.620]   They were concerned about that.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.000]   They didn't want to do that.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.740]   And certainly they didn't want to do that
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.740]   in the year 1990, '91.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.740]   As late as August of 1991, the month of the coup in Moscow,
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.780]   President Bush, Judge H.W. Bush,
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.100]   travels from Moscow to Kiev and gives famous
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.340]   or infamous speech called Chicken Kiev speech,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.340]   basically warning Ukrainians against going for independence.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.160]   The Soviet collapse was a huge headache
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.860]   for the administration in the White House
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.240]   for a number of reasons.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.140]   They liked to work with Gorbachev.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.920]   The Soviet Union was emerging as a junior partner
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.380]   of the United States in the international arena.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.540]   Collapse was destroying all of that.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.220]   And on the top of that, there was a question
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.380]   of the nuclear weapons, unaccounted nuclear weapons.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.140]   So the United States was doing everything humanly possible
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.180]   to keep the Soviet Union together in one piece
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.920]   until really late November of 1991 when it became clear
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   that it was a lost cause and they had to say goodbye
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.160]   to Gorbachev and to the project that he introduced.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.100]   A few months later, or a year later,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.820]   there was a presidential campaign
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.700]   and Bush was running for the second term
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.540]   and was looking for achievements.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.540]   And there were many achievements.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   I basically treat him with great respect.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.060]   But destruction of the Soviet Union
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.700]   was not one of those achievements.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.420]   He was on the other side of that divide.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.620]   But the politics, the political campaign,
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.500]   of course, have their own rules.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.300]   And they produce and give birth to mythology,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.820]   which we still, at least in this country,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.620]   we live till now, till today.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.820]   - So Gorbachev is an interesting figure in all of this.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.360]   Is there a possible history where the Soviet Union
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.700]   did not collapse and some of the ideas that Gorbachev had
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.100]   for the future of the Soviet Union came to life?
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.220]   - Of course, history, on the one hand, there is a statement.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.540]   It doesn't allow for what ifs.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.540]   On the other hand, in my opinion,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.700]   history is full of what if.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.100]   That's what history is about.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.140]   And certainly, certainly there are scenarios
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.980]   how the Soviet Union would continue,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.900]   would continue beyond, let's say, Gorbachev's tenure.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.840]   And the argument has been made that the reforms
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.900]   that he introduced, that they were mismanaged
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.540]   and they could be managed differently,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.420]   or there could be no reforms
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.860]   and there could be continued stagnation.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.700]   So that is all possible.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.940]   What I think would happen one way or another
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.100]   is the Soviet collapse in a different form
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.780]   on somebody else's watch at some later period in time
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.020]   because we're dealing with not just processes
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.580]   that were happening in the Soviet Union,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.420]   we're dealing with global processes.
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.700]   And the 20th century turned out to be the century
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.740]   of the disintegration of the empires.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.700]   You look at the globe at the map of the world in 1914
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.340]   and you compare it to the map at the end
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.620]   of the 20th century in 1991, 1992,
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.460]   and suddenly you realize that there are many candidates
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.220]   for being the most important event,
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.020]   the most important process in the 20th century.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.260]   But the biggest global thing that happened
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.620]   was redrawing the map of the world
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.620]   and producing dozens, if not hundreds, of new states.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.260]   That's the outcome of the different processes
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.820]   of the 20th century.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.340]   Look, Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.060]   Czechoslovakia goes through what can be called
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.940]   a civilized divorce, a very, very rare occurrence
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.100]   in the fall of multinational states.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.060]   So yeah, the writing was on the wall,
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.100]   whether it would happen under Gorbachev or later,
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.460]   whether it would happen as the result of reforms
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.740]   or as the result of no reforms.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.620]   But I think that sooner or later that would happen.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.780]   - Yeah, it's very possible, hundreds of years from now,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.460]   the way the 20th century is written about
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.580]   as the century defined by the collapse of empires.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   You call the Soviet Union the last empire.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.240]   The book is called The Last Empire.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.020]   So is there something fundamental
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.900]   about the way the world is that means
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.140]   it's not conducive to the formation of empires?
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.620]   - The meaning that I was putting in the term,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.700]   the Soviet Union as the last empire,
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.420]   was that the Soviet collapse was the collapse
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   of the last major European empires, traditional empires.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.100]   That was in the 18th century, 19th century,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.840]   and through most of the 20th century.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   The Austria-Hungary died in the midst of World War I.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.460]   The Ottoman Empire disintegrated.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.740]   The Brits were gone and left India.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.980]   And there was the successor to the Russian empire
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.980]   called the Soviet Union was still hanging on there.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   And then came 1991, and what we see even with today's Russia,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.900]   it's a very different sort of policies.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.220]   The Russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from 1991,
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:38.140]   so there is no national republics in the Russian Federation
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.800]   that would have more rights
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.620]   than the Russian administrative units.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.780]   So the structure is different.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.020]   The nationality policies are different.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.980]   The level of reciprocation is much higher.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.980]   So it is in many ways already a post-imperial formation.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.420]   - And you're right about that moment, 1991,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.500]   the role that Ukraine played in that
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.740]   seems to be a very critical role.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.900]   Can you describe just that?
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.100]   What role Ukraine played in the collapse of the Soviet Union?
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.420]   - History is many things,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.420]   but it started in a very simple way
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.340]   of making notes on the yearly basis,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.160]   what happened this year at that.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.260]   So it's about chronology.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.380]   Chronology in the history of the collapse
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.980]   of the Soviet Union is very important.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.380]   You have Ukrainian referendum on December 1st, 1991,
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.720]   and you have dissolution of the Soviet Union
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.860]   by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus one week later
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.760]   and the question is why?
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.220]   Ukrainian referendum is the answer,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.540]   but Ukrainians didn't answer their referendum question
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.040]   of whether they want the Soviet Union
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.780]   to be dissolved or not.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.660]   They answered very limited in terms of,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.420]   it's been in question whether you support the decision
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.740]   of (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.460]   of your parliament for Ukraine to go independent.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.020]   And the rest was not on the ballot.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.780]   So why then one week later the Soviet Union is gone?
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.340]   And President Yeltsin explained to President Bush
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.300]   around that time the reason why Ukraine was so important.
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.840]   He said that, well, if Ukraine is gone,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.460]   Russia is not interested in this Soviet project
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.540]   because Russia would be outnumbered and outvoted
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.540]   by the Muslim republics.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.300]   So there was a cultural element.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.800]   There was also another one.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   Ukraine happened to be the second largest Soviet republic
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.400]   and then post-Soviet state in terms of population,
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.700]   in terms of the economy, economic potential,
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.640]   and so on and so forth, and as Yeltsin suggested,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.180]   closed culturally, linguistically, and otherwise to Russia.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.620]   So with the second largest republic gone,
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.180]   Russia didn't think that it was in Russia's interest
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.700]   to continue with the Soviet Union,
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.340]   and around that time, Igor Gaidar,
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.180]   who was the chief economic advisor of Yeltsin,
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.620]   was telling him, well, we just don't have money anymore
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.980]   to support other republics.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.260]   We have to focus on Russia.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.220]   We have to use oil and gas money
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.940]   within the Russian Federation.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.500]   So the state was bankrupt.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.960]   Imperial projects, at least in the context
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.540]   of the late 20th century, they costed money.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.140]   It wasn't a money-making machine
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.620]   as it was back in the 18th or 19th century.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.620]   And the combination of all these factors
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.620]   led to the processes in which Ukraine's decision
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.000]   to go independent spelled the end to the Soviet Union.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.540]   And if today anybody wants to restore
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.380]   not the Soviet Union but some form of Russian control
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.140]   over the post-Soviet space,
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.180]   Ukraine is as important today
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.460]   as it was back in December of 1991.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.460]   - Let me ask you about Vladimir Putin's statement
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   that the collapse of the Soviet Union
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.480]   is one of the great tragedies of history.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.100]   To what degree does he have a point?
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.920]   To what degree is he wrong?
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.260]   - His formulation was that this is the greatest
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.640]   geopolitical catastrophe or tragedy of the 20th century.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.500]   And I specifically went and looked at the text
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.880]   and put it in specific time when it was happening.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.900]   And it was interesting that the statement
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   was made a few weeks before the May 9 parade
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.920]   and celebrations of the victory.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.820]   Key part of the mythology of the current Russian state.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.620]   So why say things about the Soviet collapse
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.640]   being the largest political strategy
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.460]   and not in that particular context, the Second World War?
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.160]   My explanation at least is that the World War II,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.140]   the price was enormous, but the Soviet Union emerged
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.880]   as a great victor and captured half of Europe.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.860]   1991, in terms of the loss of power,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.860]   lives lost at that point, the price was actually very low.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.380]   But for Putin what was important that the state was lost
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.440]   and he in particular was concerned about the division
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.300]   of the Russian people which he understood back then
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.140]   like he understands now in very, very broad terms.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.140]   So for him the biggest tragedy is not the loss of life.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.780]   The biggest tragedy is the loss of the great power status
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.180]   or the unity of those whom he considered
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.740]   to be Russian nation.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.500]   So at least this is my reading, this is my understanding
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.620]   of what is there, what is on the paper
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.420]   and what is between the lines.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.940]   - So both the unity of the sort of quote Russian empire
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.460]   and the status of the superpower.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.620]   - That's how I read it.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.940]   - You wrote a book, The Origins of the Slavic Nations.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.540]   So let's go back into history.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.940]   What is the origin of Slavic nations?
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.300]   - We can look at that from different perspectives
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.540]   and we are now making major breakthroughs
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.500]   in answering this question with the very interesting
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.340]   innovative linguistic analysis, the study of DNA.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.580]   So that's really the new frontier.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.660]   We are getting into prehistorical period
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.340]   where there is no historical sources.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.940]   And from what we can understand today
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.220]   and that can of course change tomorrow
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.620]   with all these breakthroughs in sciences
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.380]   is that the Slavs came into existence somewhere
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.220]   in the area of marshes, Pripyat marshes,
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.100]   northwestern part of Ukraine, southwestern part of Belarus,
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.020]   eastern part of Poland, and that is considered
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.780]   to be historical homeland of Slavs and then they spread.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.440]   And they spread all the way to the Adriatic.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.980]   So we have Croats, we have Russians
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.560]   spreading all the way to the Pacific.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.280]   We have Ukrainians, we have Belarusians, Poles.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.540]   Once we had Czechoslovaks, now we have Czechs and Slovaks.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.460]   So that's the story of starting with the eighth
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.260]   and ninth century, we can, even a little bit earlier,
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.300]   we can already follow that story with the help
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.620]   of the written sources, mostly from Byzantine
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.140]   then later from Western Europe.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.980]   But what I was trying to do, not being a scientist,
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.260]   not being an expert in linguistics
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.500]   or not being an expert in DNA analysis,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.900]   I was trying to see what was happening
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.100]   in the minds of those peoples and their elites in particular
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.540]   whom we call today not Slavs but Eastern Slavs,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.100]   which means Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.720]   how they imagined themselves, how they imagined their world,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.200]   and eventually I look at the so-called
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.720]   nation-building projects.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.940]   So trying to answer the question of how we arrived
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.280]   to the situation in which we are today
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.440]   where there are not just three East Slavic nations
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.200]   but there are also three East Slavic states,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.460]   Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.000]   so this is the focus of my book.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.660]   I end, admittedly, in that particular book,
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.480]   I end on the 18th century before the era of nationalism,
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.220]   but then there are other books like Lost Kingdom
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.800]   that I bring the story all the way up to today.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.760]   - So what aspects of the eighth and ninth century,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.980]   the East Slavic states, permeates to today
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.340]   that we should understand?
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.620]   - Well, the most important one is that
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.180]   the existence of the state of Kievan Rus
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:37.500]   back during the medieval period created foundations
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.820]   for historical mythology, common historical mythology,
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.700]   and there are just wars and battles
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.240]   over who has the right or more right for Kievan Rus.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.480]   The legal code that was created at that time
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.100]   existed for a long period of time.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.980]   The acceptance of Christianity from Byzantium,
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.780]   that became a big issue that separated
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.260]   then Eastern Slavs from their Western neighbors,
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.380]   including Czechs and Poles,
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.360]   but united in that way to, let's say,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.060]   Bulgarians or Serbs, and the beginning
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.660]   of the written literature, beginning in Kiev.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.700]   So all of that is considered to be part of heritage.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.560]   All of that is being contested.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.240]   And this debates that were academic
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.180]   for a long period of time, what we see now,
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.860]   tragically, are being continued on the battlefield.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.700]   - What is Kiev, what is Rus that you mentioned?
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.200]   What's the importance of these?
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.320]   You mentioned them as sort of defining places
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.800]   and terms, labels, at the beginning of all this.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.000]   So what is Kiev?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.840]   - Kiev became a capital, or the outpost,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   of the Vikings who were trying to establish control
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.960]   over the trade route between what is today's
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   Western Russia and Belarus and Northern Ukraine,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:21.160]   so the forest areas, and the biggest and the richest market
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.420]   in the world that existed at that time,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.260]   which was in Constantinople, in Byzantium.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.420]   So the idea was to get whatever goods you can get
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.160]   in that part of Eastern Europe,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   and most of those goods were slaves, local population,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.160]   put them on the ships in Kiev,
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.240]   because Kiev was on the border with the steppe zones.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.480]   Steppe zones were controlled by other groups,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:53.640]   Scythians, Sarmatians, Polovtsians, Pechenegs,
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   and so on, you name it, and then staying on the river,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.360]   being protected from attacks of the nomads
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.540]   to come to the Black Sea and sell these products
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.760]   in Constantinople, that was the idea.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.620]   That was the model, Vikings tried to practice
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.620]   that sort of business model also in other parts of Europe,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.460]   and like in other parts of Europe,
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.680]   they turned out to be, by default,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.060]   creators of new polities, of new states.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.060]   And that was the story of the first Kievan dynasty.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.060]   And Kiev, as the capital of that huge empire
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.600]   that was going from the Baltics to today's central Ukraine,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.480]   and then was trying to get through the southern Ukraine
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   to the Black Sea, that was a major, major European state,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:57.360]   kingdom, if you want to call it, of medieval Europe,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.960]   with creating a lot of tradition in terms of dynasty,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   in terms of language, in terms of religion,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.960]   in terms of, again, historical mythology.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   So Kiev is central for the nation-building myth
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.220]   of a number of groups in the region.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.300]   - So in one perspective and narrative,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.500]   Kiev is at the center of this Russian empire.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   At which point does Moscow come to prominence
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.200]   as the center of the Russian empire?
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.280]   - Well, the Russian empire is a term
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.300]   and really creation of the 18th century.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.760]   What we have for the Kievan, we call it Kievan Rus,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.580]   again, this is a term of the 19th century,
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.440]   they call themselves Rus.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.620]   - Rus.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.780]   - And there was metropolitan of Rus,
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.440]   and there was Rus principalities,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.420]   so very important to keep in mind that Rus is not Russia,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.360]   because that was a self-name for all multiple groups
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.100]   on that territory.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.120]   And Moscow doesn't exist at the time
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.640]   when Kiev emerges as the capital.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:20.020]   The first reference to Moscow comes from the 12th century,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.240]   when it was founded by one of the Kievan princes.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.240]   And Moscow comes to prominence really
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   in a very different context
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.120]   and with a very different empire
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.160]   running the show in the region.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.280]   The story of Moscow and the rise of Moscow,
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.360]   this is the story of the Mongol rule
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.740]   over former Rus lands and former Rus territories.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:51.760]   The part of the former Rus eventually overthrows
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   the Mongol control with the help of the small group
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.320]   of people called Lithuanians,
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.400]   which had a young state and young dynasty
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.240]   and united this lands, which were mostly in today's terms,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.280]   Ukrainian and Belarusian, so they separate early.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.340]   And what is today is Russia, mostly Western Russia,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.440]   Central Russia, stays under the Mongol control
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.440]   up until late 15th century.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.280]   And that was the story when Moscow rises
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.080]   as the new capital of that realm,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   replacing the city of Vladimir as that capital.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.240]   For those who ever went to Russia,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   they're familiar with, of course, Vladimir
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.440]   as the place of the oldest architectural monuments,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.680]   the so-called the Golden Ring of Russia
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.880]   and so on and so forth, Vladimir is central
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.200]   and there are so many architectural monuments there
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.480]   because before there was Moscow, there was Vladimir.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.940]   Eventually, in this struggle over control
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.240]   of the territory, struggle for favors from the Mongols
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.760]   and the Tatar horde, Moscow emerges as the center
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.240]   of that particular realm under Mongols
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.120]   after the Mongol rule is removed.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.080]   Moscow embarks on the project that historians,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.680]   Russian historians of the 19th century called
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.740]   the gathering of the Russian lands.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:33.520]   Using Russian now for Rus and trying to bring back
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:39.200]   the lands of former Kievan Rus
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.940]   but also the lands of the former Mongol Empire.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   The Russians get to the Pacific before they get to Kiev,
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.800]   historically, and really the quote, unquote gathering
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:01.880]   of the quote, unquote Russian lands ends only in 1945
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.400]   when the Soviet Union bullies the Czechoslovak government
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.840]   into turning what is today's Transcarpetian Ukraine
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.960]   to the Soviet Union.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.000]   It is included in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.160]   So that's the moment when that destiny,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.800]   the way how it was imagined by the 19th century
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.500]   Russian historian was eventually fulfilled.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.720]   Moscow was in control of all these lands.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.640]   - So to what degree are the Slavic people one people,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.200]   and this is a theme that will continue throughout, I think,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   versus a collection of multiple peoples,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.880]   whether we're talking about the Kievan Rus
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.640]   or we're talking about the 19th century
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.460]   Russian Empire conception?
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.700]   - Well, a number of ways to look at that.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.060]   One, the most obvious, the most clear is language.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:01.520]   And there is no question that Poles speak
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.880]   a separate language and they are Slavs.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   And there is no question for anyone going to Ukraine
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.260]   and hearing Ukrainian realizing that this is not Russian.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.620]   The level of comprehension can be different.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.500]   You can understand certain words
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.360]   and you don't understand others.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.920]   And the same would be with Polish
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   and the same would be with Czech.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.920]   So there is this linguistic history that is in common,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.440]   but languages very clearly indicate
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.860]   that you're dealing with different peoples.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.440]   We know that language is not everything.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.280]   Americans speak a particular way of English.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   Australians speak a particular variant of English.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.080]   But for reasons of geography history,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.600]   we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity,
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.920]   these are different nations and different peoples.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.880]   And there are some parts of political tradition
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.860]   are in common, others are quite different.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.740]   So the same when it comes to language,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.840]   the same when it comes to political tradition,
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.800]   to the loyalty to the political institution
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.060]   applies to Slavic nations.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.480]   So that's, again, there is nothing particularly unique
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.720]   about the Slavs in that regard.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.440]   - You wrote the book, the Cossack Myth,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.400]   History and Nationhood in the Age of Empires.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.340]   It tells the story of an anonymous manuscript
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.140]   called the History of the Rus.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.720]   It started being circulated in the 1820s.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.680]   I would love it if you can tell the story of this.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.160]   This is supposedly one of the most impactful texts
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.120]   in history, modern history.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.980]   So what's the importance of this text?
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.820]   What did it contain?
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.920]   How did it define the future of the region?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   - In the first decades of the 19th century,
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.920]   after Napoleonic Wars, a mysterious text emerged
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.200]   that was attributed to an Orthodox archbishop
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   that was long dead, which was claiming
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:18.040]   that the Cossacks of Ukraine were, in fact,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.080]   the original Rus people, and that they had the right
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.840]   for a particular place, for central place in the Russian
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.240]   Empire, and it tells the history of the Cossacks.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.800]   Full, it's the era of romanticism, full of all sorts
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.080]   of drama, there are heroes, there are villains,
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   and the text captivates the attention of some key figures
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.680]   in the Russian intellectual elite in St. Petersburg.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   People like Kondraty Oreliev, who was executed
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:04.200]   for his participation in 1825 uprising, writes poetry
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.840]   on the basis of this text.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.880]   Pushkin pays attention to it as well.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.480]   And then comes along the key figure in Ukrainian
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   national revival of the 19th century,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.920]   Ukrainian National Project, the Rosh Tovchenko,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.200]   and reads it as well.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.120]   And they all read it very differently.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:34.760]   Eventually, by the beginning of the mid-20th century,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:41.600]   some of the Russian mostly nationalist writers
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.100]   called this text the Quran of Ukrainian nationalism.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.400]   So what is there?
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.480]   The story, it's very important in a sense that
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.680]   what the authors, and that's what I claim in the book,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.280]   what the authors of the text were trying to say,
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.200]   they were trying to say that the Cossack elite
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.960]   should have the same rights as the Russian nobility,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.360]   and brings the long historical record to prove
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.920]   how cool the Cossacks were over the period of time.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.360]   But at the beginning of the 19th century,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.480]   they put this claim already, they used new arguments.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.960]   And these arguments are about nation and nationalism.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.860]   And they're saying that the Cossacks are a separate nation.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   And that's a big, big, big claim.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:43.020]   The Russian Empire, and this is a very, very good argument
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.540]   in historiography, that Russian Empire grew and acquired
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.440]   this one-sixth of the earth by using one very specific way
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.440]   of integrating those lands.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.320]   It integrated elites.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.600]   It was making deals with the elites,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.400]   whether the elites were Muslim,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.280]   or the elites were Roman Catholic, as the case was the Poles,
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.480]   they would be, elites would be integrated,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.160]   and the Empire was based on that estate,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.300]   the estate loyalty and estate integration.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   But once you bring in the factor of nation and nationalism
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.280]   and language, then once in a sudden,
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.680]   the whole model of the integration of the elites,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.520]   irrespective of their language, religion, and culture,
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.460]   starts falling apart.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.100]   And the Poles were the first who really produced
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.720]   this sort of a challenge to the Russian Empire
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.640]   by apprisings, to apprisings in the 19th century.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.400]   And Ukrainians then followed in their footsteps.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.480]   So the text, the importance of the text is that
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.540]   it was making claim on the part of a particular estate,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.020]   the Kazakh officer class,
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.960]   which was that Empire could survive.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.920]   But it turned it, given the conditions of the time,
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.360]   into the claim for the special role
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.560]   of Cossacks as a nation,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.840]   creating that this is a separate nation,
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.540]   a Rus' nation, and that is the challenge of nationalism,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.900]   that no empire really survived,
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.140]   and the Russian Empire was not an exception.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.760]   So that's a turning point when the discourse switches
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.800]   from loyalty based on the integration of the elites
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.680]   to the loyalty based on attachment to your nation,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.960]   to your language, and to your culture, and to your history.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.180]   - So that was like the initial spark, the flame,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.480]   that led to nationalist movements.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   - That was the beginning, and the beginning
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.840]   that was building a bridge between the existence
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.640]   of the Kazakh state in the 17th and 18th century
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.880]   that was used as a foundation for the Kazakh mythology,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.920]   Ukrainian national mythology,
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.240]   went into the Ukrainian national anthem,
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.880]   and the new age and the new stage
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.680]   where the Cossacks were not there anymore,
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.640]   where there were professors, intellectuals, students,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   members of the national organizations,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.600]   and it started, of course, with romantic poetry,
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.360]   it was started with collecting folklore,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.800]   and then later goes to the political stage,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.200]   and eventually the stage of mass politics.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.000]   - So to you, even throughout the 20th century under Stalin,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.960]   there was always a force within Ukraine
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.880]   that wanted to be independent.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.600]   - There were five attempts for Ukraine
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.920]   to declare its independence and to maintain it
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.060]   in the 20th century.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.040]   Only one succeeded in 1991, but there were four,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.040]   four different attempts before,
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.880]   and you see the Ukrainian national identity
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.920]   manifesting itself in two different ways.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.040]   In the form of national communism,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   after the Bolshevik victory, in Bolshevik-controlled Ukraine,
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.400]   and in the form of radical nationalism
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.580]   in the parts of Ukraine that were controlled
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.580]   by Poland and Romania, and part of that
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.000]   was also controlled by Czechoslovakia and later Hungary.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.440]   So in those parts outside of the Soviet Union,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.480]   the form of the national mobilization,
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.400]   the key form of national mobilization,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.520]   became radical nationalism.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.840]   In Soviet Ukraine, it was national communism
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.920]   that came back in the 1960s and 1970s,
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   and then in 1991, the majority of the members
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.040]   of the Ukrainian parliament who voted for independence
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.000]   were members of the Communist Party.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.920]   So that spirit, on a certain level, never died.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.040]   - So there's national communism and radical nationalism.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.520]   Well, let me ask you about the radical nationalism
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.600]   because that is a topic that comes up
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   in the discussion of the war in Ukraine today.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.840]   Can you tell me about Stepan Bandera?
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.880]   Who was he, this controversial,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.720]   far-right Ukrainian revolutionary?
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.720]   - There are at least two Stepan Banderas.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   One is the real person and another is mythology
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.700]   that really comes with this name.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   And the real person was a young student,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.480]   nationalistically-oriented student
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.400]   in the late 1920s and early 1930s
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.960]   in the part of Ukraine that was controlled by Poland
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.680]   who belonged to the generation who regretted
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.260]   that they were not born in time for the big struggles
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.260]   of World War I and revolution at that time.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.760]   They believed that their fathers lost opportunity
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.200]   for Ukraine to become independent
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.620]   and that a new ideology was needed.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.400]   And that ideology was radical nationalism
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   and new tactics were not needed.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   So Bandera becomes the leader of the organization
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   of Ukrainian nationalists in Ukraine at the young age
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.360]   and organizes a number of assassinations
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.880]   of the Polish officials or members
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.520]   of the Ukrainian community who this young people
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   in their 17, 18, 19 considered to be collaborators.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.200]   He is arrested, put on trial,
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.880]   and that's where the myth of Bandera starts to emerge
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   because he uses the trial to make statements
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.960]   about the Ukrainian nationalism,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.840]   radical nationalism and its goals
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.720]   and suddenly becomes a hero among the Ukrainian youth
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   at that time.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   He is sentenced for execution, for death,
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.300]   so when he delivers his speech he knows
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.440]   that he probably would die soon.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   And then it was the sentence was commuted to life in prison.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.640]   Then World War II happens, the Polish state collapses
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.080]   and the pressure coming of course from Nazi Germany
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   and the Soviet Union, Bandera walks away
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.460]   and presides over the act of the split
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.800]   over the organization of Ukrainian nationalists
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.080]   into two groups.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.660]   The most radical one you used to call revolutionary,
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.520]   they call themselves revolutionary, is led by Bandera.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:10.120]   They work together with the Nazi Germany at that time
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.400]   with the hope that Nazi Germany
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.460]   would deliver them independent Ukraine.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.520]   First days of the German attack,
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.240]   Nazi attack on the Soviet Union,
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.960]   the units formed on the basis of organization
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.400]   of Ukrainian nationalists march into the city of Lviv
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.240]   and declare Ukrainian independence.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.700]   That was not sanctioned by the German authorities,
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.000]   that was not in German plans.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.800]   So they arrest Bandera, members of his family,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.280]   his brothers, leaders of the organization.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   So his two brothers go to Auschwitz, die there.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.500]   He was sent to Sachsenhausen for most duration of the war
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:05.200]   until 1944, refusing to revoke declaration
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.460]   of Ukrainian independence, which again contributes further
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.520]   to his mythology.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.040]   After the war, he never comes back to Ukraine.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.720]   He lives in exile in Munich.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   So between 1930 and his death in 1959,
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:29.060]   he spent in Ukraine maybe up to two years,
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.480]   maybe a little bit more, but most of the time
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   was either in the Polish prison
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.860]   or in the German concentration camp or in exile.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:44.640]   But the myth of Bandera lived and all the members
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.760]   of the organization of Ukrainian nationalists
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.520]   and then the Ukrainian Insurgent Army
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.000]   that fought against the Soviets all the way
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.660]   into the early 1950s, they were called Banderites.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:01.120]   They were called Banderites by the Soviet authorities.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.580]   They were known also in that way to the local population.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.240]   So there was a faraway leader that barely was there
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   on the spot, but whose name was attached to this movement
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.140]   for really liberation of Ukraine at that time,
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.840]   again, the battle that failed.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.240]   - The fact that he collaborated with the Nazis sticks.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.680]   From one perspective, he's considered by many
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.820]   to be a hero of Ukraine for fighting
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.880]   for the independence of Ukraine.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:34.480]   From another perspective, coupled with the fact
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.900]   that there's this radical revolutionary extremist flavor
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.520]   to the way he sees the world,
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   that label just stays that he's a fascist, he's a Nazi.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.040]   To what degree is this true?
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.400]   To what degree is it not?
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.920]   - This label is certainly promoted by the first,
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.340]   by the Soviet propaganda and then by Russian propaganda.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.200]   It works very nicely.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.560]   If you focus on the years of collaboration,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.440]   those were the same years when Joseph Stalin
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.940]   collaborated with Hitler, right?
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.380]   So we have the same reason
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.580]   to call Stalin Nazi collaborator
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.760]   as we have the reason to call Bandera Nazi collaborator.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.660]   We look at the situation in the Pacific,
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.520]   in Indonesia, in other places.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.900]   The leaders who worked together with Japanese,
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.360]   with the idea of promoting independence of their countries,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.500]   after the Japanese collapse become leaders of the empire.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.180]   So the difference with Bandera is that he never becomes
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.860]   the leader of empire and immunity
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:52.320]   that comes with that position certainly doesn't apply to him.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.000]   But there are other parts of his life
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.320]   which certainly put this whole thing in question,
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.720]   the fate of his family, his own time
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.760]   in the German concentration camp.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.340]   Certainly don't fit the propaganda,
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.260]   one-sided image of Bandera.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.140]   In terms of him being a hero,
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.020]   that's a very, very interesting question
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.260]   because he is perceived in Ukraine today
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.940]   by not by all and probably not by the majority,
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.900]   but by many people in Ukraine
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   as a symbol of fighting against the Soviet Union
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.300]   and by extension against Russia and Russian occupation.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   So his popularity grew after February 24th, 2022
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.700]   as a symbol of that resistance.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.940]   Again, we are talking here about myth and mythology
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.380]   because Bandera was not leading the fight
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.380]   against the Soviet occupation in Ukraine
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.620]   because at that time he was just simply not in Ukraine.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.020]   He was in Germany and you can imagine
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.820]   that geography mattered at that time
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.180]   much more than it matters today.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.900]   - There's a million questions to ask here.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.640]   I think it's an important topic
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.640]   because it is at the center of the claimed reason
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.660]   that the war continues in Ukraine.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.100]   And so I would like to explore that from different angles.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.580]   But just to clarify, was there a moment
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:29.580]   where Bandera chose Nazi Germany over the Red Army
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   when the war already began?
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.600]   So in the list of allegiances,
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.340]   is Ukraine's independence more important
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.700]   than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially?
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.220]   - The Ukrainian independence was their goal
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.820]   and they were there to work with anybody
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.340]   who would support and in one way
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.980]   or at least allow the Ukrainian independence.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.180]   So there is no question that they are
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.980]   just classic nationalists.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   So the goal is, nationalism is the principle
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.660]   according to which the, or at least one definition is,
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.960]   according to which the cultural boundaries
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.460]   coincide with political boundaries.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.100]   So their goal was to create political boundaries
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.340]   that would coincide with the geographic boundaries
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.500]   in the conditions of the World War II
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.180]   and certainly making deals with whoever
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.180]   would either support, as I said,
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:39.820]   or tolerate that project of theirs.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.940]   - So I would love to find the line between nationalism,
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.760]   even extreme nationalism and fascism and Nazism.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.880]   So for Bandera the myth and Bandera the person,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.520]   to what degree, let's look at some of the ideology
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.700]   of Nazism, to which degree did he hate Jews?
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.800]   Was he anti-Semitic?
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:05.840]   - We know that basically in his circle
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.560]   there were people who were anti-Semites
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.180]   in a sense that, okay, we have the texts, right?
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.400]   We know that.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   We don't have that information about that sort of text
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.960]   or that sort of evidence with regard to Bandera himself.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:29.080]   In terms of fascism, there is very clear
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.360]   and there is research done that in particularly
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   Italian fascism had influence on the thinking
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.100]   of people in that organization, including people at the top.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.860]   But it is also very important to keep in mind
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:51.020]   that they call themselves nationalists and revolutionaries.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:56.020]   And despite the fact that in 1939, in 1940, in 1941,
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:00.740]   it was very beneficial for them to declare themselves
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.740]   to be Ukrainian fascists and establish this bond
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:11.340]   not just with Italy but with Nazi Germany,
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.420]   they refused to do that.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.660]   And then they refused to recall their independence.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.660]   So influences, yes.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:26.660]   But clearly it's a different type of a political project.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.520]   - So let me fast forward into the future
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.500]   and see to which degree the myth permeates.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.540]   Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.100]   - My understanding is there are Nazis in Ukraine.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:46.500]   And there are supporters of,
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.360]   of white supremacy theories.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.340]   But also my understanding is that
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.020]   they're extremely marginal
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:05.100]   and they're more marginal than the same sort of groups
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.980]   are in Central Europe, maybe in the U.S. as well.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   And for me the question is not whether the Ukraine has it
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.340]   but why even in the conditions of the war
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:28.980]   the radical nationalism and extremism
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:33.460]   and white supremacist is such a marginal force.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.560]   When in the countries that are not at the war,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.660]   this is, you look at France, you look at,
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.900]   again, it's not exactly Nazis but really right,
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.940]   radical right is becoming so important.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.900]   Why Ukraine in the conditions of the war
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:56.180]   is the country that manages relations
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.340]   between different ethnic groups and languages
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.420]   in the way that strengthens political nation?
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.740]   So for me as a scholar and a researcher,
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.740]   what I see is that in Ukraine the influence
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.580]   of the far right in different variations
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:20.580]   is much lower than it is among some of Ukraine's neighbors
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.780]   and in Europe in general.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.900]   And the question is why?
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.380]   I don't know, I have guesses, I don't know answer
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:32.380]   but that's the question that I think is interesting
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   to answer, how Ukraine ended up to be the only country
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.720]   in the world outside of Israel who has a Jewish president
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.280]   who is, my at least understanding,
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   is the most popular president in history
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   in terms of how long his popularity goes after the election.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   So this really from my point of view interesting questions
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.700]   and again we can certainly debate that.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.700]   - So just for context, the most popular far right party
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.920]   won 2.15% of the vote in 2019, this is before the war.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.140]   So that's where things stood.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.260]   It's unclear where they stand now.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.580]   It'd be an interesting question
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:17.700]   whether it escalated and how much.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.780]   What you're saying is that war in general
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups,
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.160]   of extremist nationalistic groups especially
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.400]   like the far right and it's interesting to see
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.320]   to what degree they have or have not risen to power
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.280]   in the sort of in the shadows.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.240]   - So no nationalist or nationalistic party
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.280]   actually crossed the barrier to get into the parliament.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.200]   So Ukraine is the country where there is no right
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.000]   or far right in the parliament.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.400]   We can't say that about Germany,
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.680]   we can't say that about France.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   So that's just one more way to stress
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.200]   this unique place of Ukraine in that sense
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.480]   and the year 2019 is the year already of the war.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:11.960]   The war started in 2014 with the annexation of the Crimea.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.900]   The frontline was near Donbas.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.040]   All these groups were fighting there.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.360]   So Ukraine maybe not to a degree that it is now
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.640]   was already on the war footing and yet,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.640]   and yet the right party couldn't get more than 2%.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.160]   So that's the question that I have in mind.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.080]   And yes, the war historically, historically of course
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   puts forward and makes from the more nationalist views
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.520]   and forces turn them from marginal forces
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.500]   into more central ones.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.840]   We talked about Bandera and we talked about organization
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.440]   of Ukrainian nationalists.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.280]   They were the most marginal group in the political spectrum
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:58.760]   in Ukraine in the 1930s that one can only imagine.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:04.840]   But World War II comes and they become
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.560]   the most central group because they also
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.200]   were from the start to go.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.840]   They knew that they had the organization.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.160]   The violence was basically one of their means.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.760]   They knew how to fight.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.960]   So historically, historically wars
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.880]   indeed produce those results.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.860]   So we are looking at Ukraine.
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.220]   We are trying to see what is happening there.
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:28.480]   - So Vladimir Putin in his interview with Tucker Carlson
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.920]   but many times before said that the current goal
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.620]   for the war in Ukraine is denazification.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:40.680]   That the purpose of the war is denazification.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   Can you explain this concept of denazification
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   as Putin sees it?
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   - Denazification is the trope that is accepted
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.740]   quite well by the former Soviet population
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.080]   and Russian population in particular.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:00.120]   The most powerful Soviet mythology
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.340]   that then was basically passed as part of heritage
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.640]   to the Russian Federation was World War II,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.760]   was fighting against fascism.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.920]   So once you use terms fascism and Nazi and denazification,
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.160]   suddenly people not just start listening,
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.840]   they just stop analyzing.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.280]   And as a propaganda tool,
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.240]   this is of course a very, very powerful tool.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:32.560]   In terms of to what degree this is the real goal or not,
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.240]   we discussed the importance of the far right
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   in Europe and in Ukraine.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.160]   So if that's the real goal of the war,
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.020]   probably the war would have to start not against Ukraine
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.560]   but probably against France or some other country
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.920]   if you take this at face value.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.480]   - There's something really interesting here,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.040]   as you mentioned.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.800]   So I've spoken to a lot of people in Russia
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:59.700]   and you said analysis stops.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.440]   In the West, people look at the word denazification
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.400]   and look at the things we've just discussed
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.840]   and kind of almost think this is absurd.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.260]   When you talk to people in Russia,
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.520]   maybe it's deep in there somewhere,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.080]   the history of World War II still reverberates
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.500]   through maybe the fears, maybe the pride,
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.820]   whatever the deep emotional history is there,
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.420]   it seems that the goal of denazification
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.900]   appears to be reasonable for people in Russia.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.320]   They don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.340]   or even the need for analysis, I guess,
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.780]   in this kind of statement, word of denazification.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:50.000]   - I would say this is broader, this is broader.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.900]   The war that started under the banner
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.340]   that Russians and Ukrainians were one and the same people
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.740]   and produces that sort of casualty
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:06.060]   really goes against also any sort of logical thinking.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.460]   But Russia is a place where the free press
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.840]   doesn't exist already for a long period of time.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   Russia is the place where there is an echo chamber,
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:26.220]   to a degree, and as war started first in 2014
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.380]   and then all out war in 2022,
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.180]   I came across a lot of people on the personal level
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.980]   but also in the media reporting
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.500]   that they really can't find common language
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.480]   with their close relatives in Russia.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.340]   People who visited Ukraine who know
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.180]   that it is not taken over by nationalists
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.120]   is not taken over by Nazis.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.700]   But the media around them, the neighbors around them,
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.380]   the people at their work basically say
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.740]   one and the same thing.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.740]   And we as humans in general, whatever our background,
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:06.860]   we are very, very, our mind is really,
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:10.580]   it's relatively easy to manipulate it.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:15.900]   And to a degree that even family connections
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:20.900]   and even family ties don't sometimes help
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.860]   to maintain that ability to think
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.020]   and to analyze on your own, to look at the facts.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.700]   - So Putin has alluded to the Yaroslav Honka incident
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:38.660]   in the Canadian parliament, September, 2023.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:43.660]   This man is a veteran of World War II on the Ukrainian side
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.940]   and he got two standing ovations in the Canadian parliament
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.940]   but they later found out that he was part of the SS.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.980]   So can you explain on this?
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.740]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:01.740]   This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess,
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.380]   propagated throughout the region.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:08.540]   - Yes, what happened during World War II
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:14.440]   was that once the Germans started to run out of manpower,
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:21.980]   they created sort of foreign legion groups
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.220]   but because those people were not Aryans,
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.260]   they were created for fighting on the battleground.
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.280]   Because they were not Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.160]   So they were put under the command of Henry Himmler,
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:43.040]   under command of SS and became known as SS Waffen units.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.700]   And one of such units was created in Ukraine
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:53.360]   with great difficulties because Nazis didn't consider Slavs
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.800]   to be generally worthy of even that sort
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.540]   of foreign legion formations.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:03.500]   But they made an exception because those people
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.540]   were coming from Galicia, which was part of Austria-Hungary,
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.180]   which means part of Austria, which means somehow
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:15.180]   we're open to the benevolent influence of the Germanic race
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.120]   and called the division Galitsyn or Galicia.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   Part of Ukrainian youth joined the Galitsyn, the division.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.940]   One of the explanations was that they were looking
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:36.940]   at the experience of World War I and seeing that the units,
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.580]   the Ukrainian units in the Austrian army then played
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.440]   a very important role in the fight for independence.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.960]   So that is one of the explanations.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.500]   You can't just use one explanation to describe motivations
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.120]   of everyone and every single person who was joined in there.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.500]   So they were sent to the front.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:01.500]   They were defeated within a few short days by the Red Army.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:08.980]   And then were retreating through Slovakia where they were
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.600]   used to fight with the partisan movement there
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.200]   and eventually surrendered to the British.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.360]   So that's the story.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   You can personally maybe understand what the good
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.120]   motivations were of this person or that person,
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.740]   but that is one of the best, one of the very tragic
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   and unfortunate pages in Ukrainian history.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:43.680]   You can't justify that as a phenomenon.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.800]   So from that point of view, the celebration
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.100]   of that experience as opposed to looking at that,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:56.100]   okay, that happened and we wish that those young men
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.340]   who were idealistic or joined the division
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:03.460]   for idealistic purposes had better understanding
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.260]   of things or made other choices.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.860]   But you can't certainly celebrate that.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.020]   And once that happened, that of course became
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:16.020]   a big propaganda item in the current war.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:23.140]   We are talking about 10 to 20,000 people in the division
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:29.500]   and we are talking about two to three million Ukrainians
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.820]   fighting in the Red Army.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:36.820]   And again, it's not like Red Army is completely blameless
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.100]   in the way how it behaved in Prussia or in Germany
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.140]   and so on and so forth.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.240]   But it's basically, it's again, we are going back
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.580]   to the story of Bandera.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   So there is a period of collaboration
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.740]   and that's what propaganda tries to define him by.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.820]   Or there is a division glitzened by 20,000 people
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.380]   and somehow it makes irrelevant the experience
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.340]   of two to three million people.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.900]   - I mean, just to clarify, I think there's just a blunder
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.720]   on the Canadian parliament side, the Canadian side
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.080]   of not doing research of, maybe correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.660]   but from my understanding, they were just doing stupid,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.120]   shallow political stuff.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.300]   Let's applaud, you know, when Zelensky shows up,
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.920]   let's have a Ukrainian veteran, let's applaud a veteran
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.780]   of World War II and then all of a sudden you realize,
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.120]   well, there's actually complexities to wars.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.880]   We can talk about, for example, a lot of dark aspects
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.480]   on all sides of World War II, the mass rape
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.820]   at the end of World War II by the Red Army.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820]   When they say martial or German, there's a lot
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.440]   of really dark complexity on all sides.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.660]   So, you know, that could be an opportunity
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.560]   to explore the dark complexity that some of the Ukrainians
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.700]   were in the SS or Bandera, the complexities there,
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.120]   but I think they were doing not a complex thing.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.780]   They were doing a very shallow applaud
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.040]   and we should applaud veterans, of course,
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.500]   but in that case, they were doing it for show
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.000]   for Zelensky and so on, so we should clarify
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.960]   that the applause wasn't knowing, it wasn't for the SS.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.940]   It was for a Ukrainian, it was for World War II veterans,
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.940]   but the propaganda, or at least an interpretation
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.140]   from the Russian side, from whatever side,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:31.000]   is that they were applauding the full person
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.780]   standing before them, which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran,
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.720]   but a Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.700]   - I don't have any particular insights,
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:44.120]   but I would be very much surprised if even one person
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.620]   in the parliament, I mean the members of the parliament,
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.880]   actually knew the whole story.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.220]   I would be very surprised.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.300]   - Yeah, the whole story of this person,
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:57.180]   and frankly, the whole story of Ukraine and Russia
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.340]   in World War II, period.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.260]   - Yes, yes.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:02.220]   - Nevertheless, they had a lot of power
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:05.440]   and really reverberated in support of the narrative
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.880]   that there is a neo-Nazi, a Nazi problem in Ukraine.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   - This is the narrative that is out there,
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.820]   and it's especially powerful in Russia.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.460]   It's especially powerful in Russia,
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:24.460]   given that there are really the atmosphere that is created,
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:32.620]   really is not conducive to any independent analysis.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.420]   - Well, I wonder what is the most effective way
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.940]   to respond to that particular claim?
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.300]   Because there could be a discussion about nationalism
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.160]   and extreme nationalism and the fight for independence
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.660]   and whether it isn't, like Putin wrote, one people.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.900]   But the question of are there Nazis in Ukraine
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.340]   seems to be a question that could be...
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   Analyzed rigorously with data.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.440]   - That has been done on the academic level,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.860]   but in terms of the public response and public discourse,
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:16.100]   the only response that I see is not to focus
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.340]   on the questions raised and put by the propaganda,
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.140]   because you're already become victim
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.700]   of that propaganda by definition.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.700]   But talk about that much broadly,
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.700]   and talk about different aspects of,
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.840]   if it is World War II, about different aspects
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.340]   of World War II.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.020]   If it's about issue of the far right in Ukraine,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.300]   let's talk about US, let's talk about Russia,
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.100]   let's talk about France, let's compare.
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.080]   That's the only way how you deal with propaganda,
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.500]   because propaganda is not necessarily something
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:58.060]   that is an outright lie.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:03.060]   Can be just one factor that's taken out of the context
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:08.260]   and is blown out of proportion, and that is good enough.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.320]   - And the way to defend against that
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.940]   is to bring in the context.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.140]   Let us move gracefully throughout,
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.060]   back and forth through history, back to Bandera.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.840]   You wrote a book on the KGB spy, Bogdan Stashinsky.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.940]   Can you tell his story?
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.260]   - This is a story of the history of the organization
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:34.340]   of Ukrainian nationalists, and Bandera as well,
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.160]   already after the end of the Second World War.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.600]   Because what you got after the Second World War,
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.600]   so imagine May of 1945, the red banner
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.900]   is all over Riksdag, the Red Army is in control
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.020]   of half of Europe, but the units of the Red Army
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:00.020]   are still fighting the war, and not just behind
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.420]   the Soviet lines, but within the borders
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.500]   of the Soviet Union.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:08.820]   And this war continues all the way into the early 1950s,
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.980]   up to, almost up to Stalin's death.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.780]   The war is conducted by the organization
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.580]   of Ukrainian nationalists, which have a Ukrainian
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:22.220]   insurgent army, and the government tries
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.320]   to crush that resistance.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.100]   So what it does is basically recruits local people
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:34.540]   to spy on the partisans on the underground.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.380]   And Bogdan Stashinsky is one of those people.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.100]   His family is supporting the resistance.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.980]   They provide food, his sister is engaged
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:49.980]   with one of the local commanders of this underground unit,
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:54.940]   and they know everything about Stashinsky's family,
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.960]   and they know everything about him,
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.260]   because he is also collecting funds for the underground.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.900]   So they have a conversation with him,
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.060]   saying that, okay, that's what we got,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:11.100]   and you and your family can go to prison,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.760]   or you help us a little bit.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:18.340]   We are interested in the fiance of your sister,
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:19.540]   and we want to get him.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.620]   And Stashinsky says yes.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.780]   And once they round up the fiance,
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.460]   he basically betrayed a member,
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.300]   or almost member of his family.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.460]   He is done.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.020]   He can't go back to his village.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.620]   He can't go back to his study.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.020]   He was studying in Lviv at that time.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.860]   So he becomes, as I write in my book,
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.420]   the secret police becomes his family.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:50.880]   And he is sent to Kiev, he is trained for two years,
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.500]   sent to East Germany, into Berlin,
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.400]   and becomes an assassin.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.300]   So they sent him across the border
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.140]   to Western Germany, to Munich,
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   which was the headquarter of different organizations,
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.020]   anti-Soviet organizations.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.660]   Ukrainian, and Russian, and Georgian,
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.420]   and so on and so forth.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   And he kills two leaders of the organization
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.180]   of Ukrainian nationalists.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.060]   One editor of the newspaper,
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.700]   and eventually he kills Bandera.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   He does that with the new weapon, a spray pistol,
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.820]   that eventually makes it into the Bond novel,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.280]   "The Man with the Golden Gun."
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.740]   And that whole episode is a little bit reshaped,
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.560]   but it is not in the film,
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.900]   but it is in the novel itself.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.100]   And then later has a change of mind
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.100]   under the influence of his German fiance and then wife.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.900]   They decide to escape to the West.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.820]   And while they're doing that,
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.860]   they discover that their apartment was bugged,
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.660]   and probably the KGB knows all of that.
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.660]   So a long story short, his son dies in Berlin.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:25.820]   The KGB doesn't allow him to go there,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.900]   but his wife has a nervous breakdown,
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.660]   so they allow him to go there to just calm her
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.140]   so that there would be no scandal.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:39.140]   And two of them, one day before their son's burial,
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:44.240]   because after that they would be sent to Moscow,
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:49.080]   they jumped the ship and go to West Berlin,
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:54.080]   two hours before the Berlin Wall was being built.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.100]   So if they would stay for the funeral,
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:01.260]   probably the KGB would not let them go.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.220]   But also if they would stay, the border would be there.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.740]   And he goes to the American intelligence and says,
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.120]   "Okay, that's who I am, and that's what I did."
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.060]   And they look at him and they say, "I don't trust you.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.120]   "We don't know who you are.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.000]   "You have documents in five names.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.880]   "You say you killed Bandera.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.020]   "Oh, we have different information."
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.060]   He was poisoned and probably by someone
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:34.500]   in his close circle.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   A spray pistol, did you reach too much Ian Flaming?
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:43.900]   Where does this come from?
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.860]   He insists.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.980]   They said, "Okay, you insist.
[01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:49.060]   "If you committed all those crimes,
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.000]   "we're giving you to the German police
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.940]   "and German police will be investigating you."
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.540]   And then the trial comes,
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:02.540]   and if he says, if he takes back his testimony,
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.580]   the whole case against him collapses.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.140]   He can go free.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.720]   But he knows that if he goes free,
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.540]   he is a target of his colleagues from the same department.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.860]   So his task in the trial is to prove that he is guilty,
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.660]   that he has did that.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.600]   And then he disappears.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.820]   Nobody knows where he goes,
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.760]   and there are all sorts of cover stories.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.260]   And I was lucky to interview a commander,
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.860]   former chief of the South African police,
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:40.940]   confirmed to me that Stashinsky was in South Africa.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:41.980]   - He fled.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.020]   - The West German intelligence thought
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.720]   that it was too dangerous for him to stay in Germany.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.940]   They sent him under a different name to South Africa.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.540]   So that's the story of Stashinsky himself.
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.260]   But going back to Bandera,
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.460]   of course, the fact that he confessed
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.460]   and it became known that KGB assassinated Bandera
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:09.460]   that added to the image
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:12.140]   and to general mythology about Bandera.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.540]   - What a fascinating story of a village boy
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.380]   becoming an assassin who killed
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:20.260]   one of the most influential revolutionaries
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.680]   of the region in the 20th century.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.980]   So what, just zooming out broadly on the KGB,
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.880]   how powerful was the KGB?
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.340]   What role did it play in this whole story
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.740]   of the Soviet Union?
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.640]   - It depends on the period.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.080]   At the time that we just described,
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.240]   late '50s and early '60s,
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.340]   they were not powerful at all.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.740]   And the reasons for that was that
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.340]   people like Khrushchev were really concerned
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:56.260]   about the secret police becoming too powerful.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.700]   It became too powerful in their mind
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.420]   under Stalin, under Beria.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:05.340]   And it was concern about the Beria's power
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:10.340]   as a secret police chief that led to the coup against Beria.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.980]   And Khrushchev come into power
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.320]   and Beria was arrested and executed.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.640]   And what Khrushchev was trying to do after that
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.660]   was trying to put,
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:27.680]   since '54, the name was already KGB,
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.820]   KGB under his control.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.460]   So he was appointing the former Komsomol leaders
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.860]   as the heads of the KGB.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.600]   So the people who really,
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.220]   really owned everything to him,
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.640]   that sort of position.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.420]   And the heads of the KGB were not members of Politburo.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.260]   It changed in the '70s with Andropa
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:55.340]   where KGB started to play, again,
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:57.940]   very important role in the Soviet history.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:02.700]   And let's say decisions on Afghanistan
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.980]   and the Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:10.300]   were made by the, apart from Brezhnev,
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.420]   by the trio of the people who would be called today
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.220]   Seleviki maybe, or not all of them were Seleviki,
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.860]   but one, of course, was Andropa, the head of the KGB.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.380]   Another was the minister of defense.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.160]   And then there was secretary in charge
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.680]   of the military industrial complex,
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.480]   a minister of foreign affairs.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.000]   So, but the head of the KGB became really
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.820]   not just the member of Politburo,
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.700]   but the member of that inner circle.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:42.020]   And then the fact that Andropa succeeds Brezhnev
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.140]   is also a manifestation of the power
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   that KGB acquired really after Khrushchev in the 1970s
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.060]   and then going into the 1980s.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.260]   - Who was more powerful, the KGB or the CIA
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.540]   during the Soviet Union?
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:03.540]   - The CIA, it's the organization that is charged
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:09.500]   with the information gathering and all sorts of operations,
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:15.140]   including assassinations in the '50s and '60s abroad.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:20.980]   The KGB was the organization that really had
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.380]   both the surveillance over the population
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:30.380]   within the Soviet Union and also the operations abroad
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:36.440]   and its members, its leaders were members
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.220]   of the inner circle for making decisions.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.420]   I, again, from what I understand about the way
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.300]   how politics and decisions work
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.560]   and decisions are made in the United States,
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.900]   the CIA, the chief of the CIA is not one
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:56.880]   of the decision-making group that provided information.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.900]   Yes, so I would say it's not day and night,
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.060]   but their power, political influence,
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.840]   political significance, very different.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.720]   - Is it understood how big the KGB was?
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.540]   How widespread it was, given its secretive
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.380]   and distributed nature?
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.820]   - Certain things we know, others we don't
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.260]   because the Stasi archives are open
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.700]   and most of the KGB, especially in Moscow, they're not.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:28.140]   But we know that the KGB combined not only
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   the internal sort of secret police functions at home
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:39.660]   and counterintelligence branch and intelligence branch
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:44.040]   abroad, but also the border troops, for example, right?
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:49.040]   So really, institutionally, it was a huge, huge mammoth.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.520]   And another thing that we know, we can sort of extrapolate
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.900]   from what we know from the Stasi archives,
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.660]   that the surveillance at home,
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.460]   the surveillance was really massive.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:07.740]   The guess is the Soviets were not as effective
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   and as meticulous and as scrupulous and as methodical
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.380]   as probably as Germans were, but that gives you
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.300]   a basic idea of how penetrated the entire society was.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.060]   - What do you think is important to understand
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.500]   about the KGB if we want to also understand Vladimir Putin,
[01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   since he was a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years?
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.980]   - From my research, including on the Stashinsky,
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:42.980]   what I understand is that in KGB,
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.940]   and it was a powerful organization again,
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.660]   less powerful in '50s and '60s,
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.300]   but still very powerful organization.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:54.300]   There was, on the one hand, the understanding
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.460]   of the situation in the country and abroad
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.760]   that probably other organizations didn't have.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:07.320]   They had also first peak in terms of the selecting cadres.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.300]   The work in the KGB was well paid
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:13.100]   and considered to be very prestigious.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:17.300]   So that was part, to a degree, of the Soviet elite
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.420]   in terms of whom they recruited.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.340]   And they had a resentment toward the party leadership.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:27.900]   They didn't allow them to do James Bond kind of things
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.660]   that they would want to do because there were
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.340]   political risks.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:35.280]   After this scandal with Stashinsky,
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:41.860]   at least on many levels, the KGB stopped the practice
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.640]   of the assassinations, political assassinations abroad
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.620]   because it was considered politically
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.040]   to be extremely, extremely dangerous.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.480]   The person who was in charge of the KGB
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.000]   at the time of Bandera's assassination,
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   Shelepin, was one of the candidates to replace Khrushchev.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:03.900]   And Brezhnev used against him that scandal abroad,
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.460]   eventually to remove him from Politburova.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:11.580]   So the KGB was really looking at the party leadership
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.540]   as, to a degree, ineffective, corrupt,
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.780]   and was on their way.
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:21.780]   And from what I understand, that's exactly the attitudes
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:28.760]   that people like Putin and people of his circle
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.060]   brought to power in Kremlin.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.140]   So the methods that KGB used, they can use now
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:42.100]   and there is no party or no other institution
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.260]   actually stopping them from doing that.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:48.580]   And they think about, my understanding,
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:52.860]   the operations abroad about foreign policy in general
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:56.180]   in terms of the KGB mindset of planning operations
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:59.060]   and executing particular operations and so on and so forth.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.980]   So I think a lot of culture
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.700]   that came into existence in the Soviet KGB
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:10.700]   now became part of the culture of the Russian establishment.
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:16.300]   - You wrote the book, The Russo-Ukrainian War,
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:21.300]   The Return of History, that gives the full context
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:27.300]   leading up to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.660]   in February 2022.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:35.580]   So can you take me through the key moments in history
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.420]   that led up to this war?
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:41.060]   So we'll mention the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.340]   We could probably go much farther back.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.020]   But the collapse of the Soviet Union, mentioned 2014,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.260]   maybe you can highlight key moments
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:53.640]   that led up to 2022.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.980]   - The key moments would be first the year 2004,
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.060]   known for Orange Revolution in Ukraine,
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:08.060]   and then the year 2013, known as the Revolution of Dignity.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:12.940]   Both were the revolts against the something
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:16.860]   that by significant part of Ukrainian population
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.860]   was considered to be completely, completely unacceptable
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.780]   actions on the part of the government
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:27.220]   and people in the government at that time.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:31.340]   So the Orange Revolution of 2004 was a protest
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.920]   against falsified presidential elections.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.420]   And rejection of a candidate that was supported by Russia,
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.380]   publicly supported by Russia.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.180]   I remember being in Moscow at that time
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.380]   and couldn't believe my eyes when in the center of Russia
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.700]   I saw a billboard with Yanukovych.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.980]   And the trick was that there were a lot of Ukrainians
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.020]   in Russia and in Moscow in particular,
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.020]   and they had the right to vote.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:03.700]   And it led to the election of,
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:09.260]   as Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko,
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:13.420]   who put on the agenda the issue
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.740]   of Ukraine's membership in NATO.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:19.400]   So it was very clear pro-Western orientation.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   And the second case was the Revolution of Dignity 2013,
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:29.640]   with some of the same characters including Yanukovych,
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.160]   who at that time was already President of Ukraine.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   And there the question was of the government
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:44.340]   promising the people for one year at least
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.740]   to sign association agreement with European Union.
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.360]   And then turning over, almost overnight,
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.660]   and saying that they were not going to do that.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.940]   And that's how things started.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.900]   But then when they became really massive,
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:04.900]   and why something that was called Euro Revolution
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.340]   became Revolution of Dignity,
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.860]   was when the government police
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:15.780]   beat up students in downtown Kiev,
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:19.740]   who, judging by the reports,
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.820]   were basically already almost ready to disperse,
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.940]   almost ready to go home.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:27.660]   And that's when roughly half of Kiev
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.100]   showed up on the streets.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:33.660]   That sort of the police behavior,
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.460]   that sort of the, was absolutely unacceptable in Ukraine.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:43.520]   The still in elections and falsification of elections
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.760]   was unacceptable.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.380]   That's where around that time,
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.660]   and around 2004, the President of Ukraine at that time,
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.660]   Leonid Kuchma writes a book called "Ukraine is Not Russia."
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:03.700]   And apparently the term comes from his discussion
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:08.060]   with Putin, when Putin was suggesting to him
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.500]   quite strongly to use force against people
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.780]   on the Maidan on the square in Kiev.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:17.400]   And Kuchma allegedly said to him,
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.900]   "You don't understand, Ukraine is not Russia.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:26.320]   "You can't do things like that, you get pushed back."
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   And that's these two events, 2004 and then 2013,
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.080]   and became really crucial point
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.420]   in terms of the Ukraine direction,
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.740]   the survival of Ukrainian democracy,
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.140]   which is one of very few countries
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.820]   in the post-Soviet space where democracy survived
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:50.820]   the original flirt between the government leaders
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:55.300]   and democracy of the 1990s.
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:59.180]   It was the all-Soviet story in Russia, everywhere else,
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:02.440]   there was high democratic expectations,
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.980]   but they came pretty much to an end.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:09.100]   By the end of the decade, Ukraine preserved the democracy.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:14.100]   And the orientation of Ukraine toward integration
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:19.860]   in some form into Western and European structures,
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.220]   that Ukrainian democracy plus Western orientation
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:30.380]   was something, and in Russia we see the strengthening
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.720]   of the autocratic regime under Vladimir Putin.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.740]   That, if you look deeper, these are the processes
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.460]   that put the two countries on the collision course.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:44.600]   - So there's a division, a push and pull inside Ukraine
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.660]   on identity of whether they're part of Russia
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:52.940]   or part of Europe, and you highlighted two moments
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.300]   in Ukrainian history that there's a big flare-up
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:01.300]   where the statement was first, "Ukraine is not Russia,"
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.860]   and essentially, "Ukraine is part of Europe."
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.220]   But there's other moments.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:10.020]   What were the defining moments that began an actual war?
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:10.860]   And the--
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:13.540]   - The war started in February of 2014
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:18.540]   with the Russian takeover of Crimea by military force,
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.200]   the so-called Green Man.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:27.060]   And the big question is why?
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.300]   And it's very important to go back to the year 2013
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.860]   and the start of the protests
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.340]   and the story of the Ukraine signing Association Agreement
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.540]   with the European Union.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.980]   So from what we understand today,
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:48.860]   the Ukrainian government under President Yanukovych
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.460]   did this suicidal, sharp turn after one year
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.780]   of promising Association Agreement, saying that,
[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:59.220]   "Okay, we changed our mind," under pressure from Moscow.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:05.420]   And Moscow applied that pressure for one reason,
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.120]   at least in my opinion.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.380]   The Ukraine signing Association Agreement
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:17.380]   with the European Union would mean that Ukraine
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:21.100]   would not be able to sign Association Agreement
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.060]   with any Eurasian Union in any shape or form
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:29.020]   that was at that time in the process of making.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:32.740]   And for Vladimir Putin, that was the beginning of his,
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.700]   or part of his third term.
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.660]   One of his agenda items for the third term
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:43.820]   was really a consolidation of the post-Soviet space
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.600]   and Eurasian space and not membership in NATO,
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.980]   not membership in European Union.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:54.940]   But Association Agreement with European Union meant
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:59.940]   that that post-Soviet space would have to exist
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.740]   under Moscow's control but without Ukraine,
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.420]   the second largest post-Soviet republic,
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.500]   the republic on whose vote depended
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.780]   the continuing existence of the Soviet Union
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.340]   and whose vote ended, in many ways,
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.460]   the existence of the Soviet Union.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.220]   So that is broadly background,
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.420]   but also there are, of course, personalities,
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:26.740]   there are also their beliefs, their readings of history,
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:31.700]   and all of that became part of the story.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.860]   But if you look at that geopolitically,
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:39.780]   the Association Agreement is Putin, Putin, Ukraine,
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:43.320]   outside of the Russian sphere of influence.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:48.780]   And the response was an attempt
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:53.780]   to topple the government in Kiev,
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:59.020]   that clearly was going to sign that agreement,
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:04.740]   to take over Crimea and to help to deal
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.420]   with a lot of issues within Russia itself
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:12.400]   and boost the popularity of the president
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:16.580]   and it certainly worked in that way as well.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.580]   And once Ukraine still, after Crimea,
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:25.380]   continued on its path, then the next step started
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:29.180]   the so-called hybrid warfare in Donbas.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:34.180]   But again, unlike Crimea, from what I understand,
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:39.020]   Russia was not really looking forward
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:41.660]   to taking possession over Donbas.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.340]   Donbas was viewed as the way how to influence Ukraine,
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:49.460]   to stop it from drift toward the West.
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:52.420]   - Maybe you can tell me about the region of Donbas.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.700]   - I mentioned that nationalism and principle of nationalism
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:59.700]   is the principle of making the political borders
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:03.040]   to coincide with ethnic and cultural borders.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.040]   And that's how the maps of many East European countries
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.540]   had been drawn in the 19th and 20th century.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:17.820]   On that principle, Donbas, where the majority constituted
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:24.260]   by the beginning of the 20th century were Ukrainians,
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:27.420]   was considered to be Ukrainian and was claimed
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:31.820]   in the middle of this revolution and revolutionary wars
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:35.040]   and civil wars by Ukrainian government.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:41.060]   But Donbas became a site, one of the key sites
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:44.580]   in the Russian empire of early industrialization.
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:48.580]   And it's mining industry, it's mythological industry.
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:52.820]   So what that meant was that people from other parts
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.700]   of, not Ukraine, but other parts of the Russian empire
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.500]   congregated there, that's where jobs were.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:02.380]   That's how Khrushchev and his family came to Donbas.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.300]   The family of Brezhnev overshoot a little bit,
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.420]   they got to the industrial enterprises
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:12.420]   in the city of Kaminsky near Dniprovsk,
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.520]   the place, the city that was called Dnipropetrovsk.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.260]   So those were Russian peasants moving into the area
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:22.100]   in looking for the job.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.980]   And by the, the population became quite mixed.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:34.020]   Ukrainians still constituted the majority of the population,
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.780]   but not necessarily in the towns and in the cities.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.460]   And culturally, the place was becoming more and more Russian
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.060]   as the result of that moment.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:49.980]   So apart from the Crimea, Donbas was the part of Ukraine
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.940]   where the ethnic Russians were the, the biggest group.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.700]   They were not the majority, but they were very,
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.500]   very big and significant group.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.940]   For example, in the city of Mariupol,
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.340]   that was all but destroyed in the course of the last,
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:11.340]   of the last two years, the ethnic Russians constituted
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.940]   over 40% of the population, right?
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.500]   So that's not exactly part of Donbas,
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.200]   but that gives you, that gives you general idea.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:26.300]   Now, the story of Donbas and what happened now
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.320]   is multidimensional, and this ethnic composition
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.420]   is just one part of the story.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:35.260]   Another very important part of the story is economy.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:41.460]   And Donbas is a classical rust belt,
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:45.880]   and we know what happens with the cities
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.000]   that were part of the first or second wave
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.220]   of industrialization in the United States.
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.780]   And globally, you know about social problems
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.080]   that exist in those places.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.480]   So Donbas is probably the most dramatic and tragic case
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.720]   of implosion of the rust belt,
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.360]   because the mines not anymore producing the sort of the,
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.960]   and at the acceptable price,
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.700]   the coal that they used to produce,
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:17.500]   is people losing jobs, with the politicians
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:21.160]   looking for subsidies as opposed to trying
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.080]   very unpopular measures of dealing something
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.940]   and bring new money and new investment into the region.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:35.340]   So all of that, all of that become part of the story
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:40.340]   that made it easy for Russia, for the Russian Federation,
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:43.220]   to destabilize the situation.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.800]   We have interviews with Mr. Yerkin,
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.880]   who is saying that he was the first who pulled the trigger
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.680]   and fired the shot.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.860]   In that war, he became the minister of defense
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:00.360]   in the Donetsk People's Republic.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.760]   You look at the prime minister,
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.680]   he is another person with Moscow residency permit.
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.520]   So you see key figures in those positions
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.600]   at the start and the beginning,
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.580]   not being Russians from Ukraine,
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:22.300]   but being Russians from Russia and Russians from Moscow,
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.960]   closely connected to the government structure
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.480]   and the intelligence structure and so on.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:29.880]   So that is the start and the beginning,
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.880]   but the way how it exploded, the way it did,
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.640]   was also a combination of the economic
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.800]   and ethnocultural and linguistic factors.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   - So for Putin, the war in Donbas, and even in 2022,
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.980]   is a defensive war against what the Ukrainian government
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:54.720]   is doing against ethnically Russian people in Donbas.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.100]   Is that fair to say, how he describes it?
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.100]   - What we see, this is certainly the argument.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:05.760]   This is certainly the argument.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.760]   And a pretext, because what we see there
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.840]   is that there would be no,
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.440]   and there was no independent mobilization in Crimea,
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.240]   either in Crimea or in Donbas, without Russian presence.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.780]   Without Russian occupation, the fact of the Crimea,
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.680]   there would be no, and there was no before,
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:36.600]   at least in the previous five to six years,
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.240]   any mass mobilizations of Russians.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.400]   There was none of such mobilizations in Donbas
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.420]   before Gherkin and other people with military,
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:52.360]   with parts of military units showed up there.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:56.120]   So it is an excuse.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.440]   You've been to Ukraine.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.720]   You know that Russian language is not persecuted in Ukraine.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.920]   And if you've not been to Donbas,
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.800]   it would be difficult, or to the Crimea,
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.740]   it would be difficult to find one single Ukrainian school.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.600]   Not that they didn't exist at all,
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:20.080]   but it would take quite an effort for you to find it.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.800]   Or sometimes even to hear Ukrainian language
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.800]   outside of the institutions or the farmers market.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:33.340]   So that's the reality.
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.900]   That's the reality that is clear, that is visible.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:39.780]   So imagine under those conditions and contexts
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:44.780]   that someone is persecuting ethnic Russians
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:50.160]   or Russian speakers, want to believe in something like that.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.200]   One important precondition is never to step your foot
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.740]   in Ukraine.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.720]   - I should mention, maybe this is a good moment
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.100]   to mention, when I traveled to Ukraine,
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.900]   this is after the start of the war,
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:09.480]   I mentioned farmer's market, which is funny.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.800]   Basically every single person I talked to,
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:15.100]   including the leadership, we spoke in Russian.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:20.520]   For many of them, Russian is the more comfortable language
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.760]   even.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.900]   And the people who spoke Ukrainian are more on the
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.120]   west, western side of Ukraine.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:33.380]   And young people that are kind of willing to show that
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:37.840]   in an activist way that they want to fight
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.500]   for the independence of their country.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.840]   So I take your point.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.160]   I wonder if you want to comment about language.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.600]   And maybe about the future of language in Ukraine.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:51.960]   Is the future of language going to stabilize on Ukrainian?
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:57.440]   Or is it going to return to its traditional base
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.660]   of Russian language?
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.220]   - Very roughly, before the start of the war in 2014,
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:06.660]   we can talk about parity between Russian and Ukrainian
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:11.260]   and also with, as you said, clearly Ukraine being
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.300]   a dominant language in the west and Russian being
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:18.060]   a dominant language on the streets,
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.260]   certainly in the east of the country.
[01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:27.380]   And then in between of that, to polls,
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:30.220]   a number of these transitional areas.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:35.060]   And Ukraine, in my experience,
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.500]   and I visited a lot of countries, not all of them
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:42.020]   and probably maybe I will be still surprised,
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:46.820]   but in my experience, this is the only truly bilingual
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.860]   country that I ever visited.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:51.260]   I lived in Canada for a long period of time.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.860]   There is Quebec and the rest.
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:57.860]   And in Ukraine, you can talk in either Russian
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:02.580]   or Ukrainian in any part of the country
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:06.100]   and you would be understood and you would be responded
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.380]   in a different language with the expectation
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:10.980]   that you would understand.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:13.340]   And if you don't understand, that means
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:15.180]   you don't come from Ukraine.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.300]   That's the reality.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:21.300]   The war and loss of the Crimea and partial loss of Donbas
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:27.300]   if it's major industrial areas really shifted
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:32.380]   the balance toward mostly Ukrainian-speaking regions.
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:41.140]   And also what you see and you clearly pointed to that,
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:46.660]   starting with 2014, even a little bit earlier,
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:50.460]   the younger generation chooses Ukrainian
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:53.660]   as a marker of its identity.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.740]   And that started in 2014, but we have a dramatic,
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:02.060]   dramatic shift after 2022.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:06.380]   And on the anecdotal level, I can tell you
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.380]   that I speak to people who be in Geneva at the time,
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:17.580]   this is east of Crimea, at the time of the Russian
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.940]   aggression and bombardment and so on and so forth,
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.420]   who had passive knowledge of Ukrainian
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.840]   but spoke all their life Russian.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.380]   And they would speak Ukrainian to me and when I say,
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.380]   okay, why are you doing that?
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:34.300]   We know each other for decades and you used Russian.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.700]   And he said, oh, I don't want to have anything
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   in common with people who did that to us.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:45.700]   So there is a big, big push of course with this current war.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.060]   Now the question is whether this change is something
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.100]   that will stay or not, what is the future?
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.680]   Linguistic practices are very, very conservative ones.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.700]   And we at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:05.820]   have a project called Mappa Digital Atlas of Ukraine
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:10.820]   and we were documenting and mapping different data in time.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:17.100]   And what we noticed a spike in the people self-reporting
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:20.640]   of use of Ukrainian in 2014 and 2015 at the time
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.160]   of the start of the war when the threat
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.180]   was the most clear one, this is self-reporting.
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.260]   That doesn't mean that people exactly do what,
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:35.660]   but they believe that that's what they are supposed to do.
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:39.160]   And then return back to where it was
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.320]   by the year 2016 and 2017.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:46.660]   So this dynamic can repeat itself.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:50.860]   But given how long the war is going on,
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:53.540]   how big the impact is, how big the stress is,
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.540]   and that the wave of the future is probably associated
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:01.340]   with younger people who are switching to Ukrainian.
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:06.340]   So I would, my bet would be on Ukrainian language
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:10.940]   rising in prominence.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.120]   - So as we get closer to February of 2022,
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.880]   there's a few other key moments.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:23.440]   Maybe let's talk about in July 2021,
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.620]   Putin publishing an essay titled
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:28.980]   On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:33.980]   Can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay?
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:38.220]   - The idea is very conveniently presented already
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:42.020]   in the first paragraph, in the first sentences, really,
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:46.580]   of the article, where Putin says that for a long time
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:49.100]   I was saying that Russians and Ukrainians
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.300]   were one and the same people, and here is the proof.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.460]   This is the historical, he develops
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.700]   his historical argumentation, apparently,
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:03.480]   with the help of a lot of people around him.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.860]   And he started to talk about Russians and Ukrainians
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.780]   being one and the same people
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.980]   one year before the start of the war in 2014.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.720]   So in 2013, he was together with
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:20.100]   Patryarch Kirill on visit to Kyiv,
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:22.540]   and there was a conference specifically organized
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.940]   for him in the Kyiv and Kyiv's monastery,
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.980]   and that's where he stated that.
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:31.940]   The fact that he was with Patryarch Kirill
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:36.900]   is very important factor for understanding
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:38.460]   where the idea is coming from.
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:45.180]   This is the idea that was dominant in the Russian Empire
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.540]   of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century,
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.660]   that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:54.560]   are really great Russians, little Russians,
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:59.560]   and white Russians, and that they constitute one people.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.900]   Yes, there are some dialectical differences.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:08.780]   Yes, Ukrainians sin well.
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:13.780]   Yes, they dance funny, but overall, that doesn't matter.
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:20.820]   And that idea actually was really destroyed,
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:27.860]   mostly destroyed by the revolution of 1917,
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.640]   because it wasn't just social revolution.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.220]   That's how it is understood in US,
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:35.580]   in good part of the world.
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:37.060]   It was also national revolution.
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:38.340]   It was an empire.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:41.420]   It was a revolution in the Russian Empire.
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:46.120]   And to bring these pieces of empire back
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.460]   within the Soviet Union,
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.220]   the Bolsheviks had to make concessions.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.160]   One of those concessions was to recognition
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.500]   of the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation,
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.200]   Belarusians as a separate nations,
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.040]   Russians as a separate nations,
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.040]   endowing them with their own territorial, with borders,
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:09.840]   with institutions, and so on and so forth.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.200]   But there was one institution that was not reformed.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:19.200]   That institution was called the Russian Orthodox Church,
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.940]   because one of the ways that Bolsheviks dealt with it,
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.080]   they couldn't eradicate religion completely,
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.360]   but they arrested the development of the religion
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.780]   and thinking and theology
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:39.140]   on the level as it existed before the revolution of 1917.
[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:43.780]   So the Russian Orthodox Church of 1917
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:48.780]   continued to be the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991,
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.860]   and in 2013, continuing the same imperial mantra
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:57.780]   of the existence of one big Russian nation,
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.800]   one unified people.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.800]   And when you see the formation of the ideas
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.320]   about nations, about foreign policy
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.320]   in the Russian Empire after 1991,
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.320]   they're going back to the pre-Bolshevik times.
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.240]   Ukrainians do that as well, Estonians do that as well.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.640]   The difference is that when Ukrainians go back,
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:30.560]   they go back to the pre-1917, their intellectual fathers
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:34.360]   and writings of basically liberal nationalism.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.920]   Or sometimes they go to the radical nationalism of Bandera,
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.640]   which would be not pre-1917, but pre-1945.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.640]   When the Russians go to pre-Bolshevik past,
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:50.040]   looking for the ideas, looking for inspiration,
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.980]   looking for the narratives, what they find there is empire.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.640]   What they find there are imperial projects.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.820]   And that's certainly the story of Putin's claim,
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.140]   that's the story of the argument.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:09.640]   And to conclude, the argument that he lays out there,
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.240]   historical argument, comes also almost directly
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.140]   from the narratives of the late 19th
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.040]   and the beginning of the 20th century.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   So it's not only the argument is coming from that era,
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.820]   but also the argumentation is coming from that era as well.
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:29.120]   - But those arguments are all in the flavor of empire.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.920]   - It's empire on the one hand,
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:33.980]   but also there is imperial understanding
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:36.100]   of what Russian nation is.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:41.020]   That doesn't allow for independence of its little Russian
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:44.600]   and white Russian branches, alleged branches, right?
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.360]   So what you see is the concept of the big Russian nation,
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.280]   that's late 19th, beginning 20th century.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.340]   Empire sees the writing on the wall,
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:57.360]   that nationalism is on the rise.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:02.360]   And it tries to survive by mobilizing the nationalism
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.880]   of the largest group in the empire,
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.280]   which happens to be Russian.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:12.440]   Stalin is a big promoter of some form of Russian nationalism,
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:15.600]   especially during the war and after war.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.960]   And he started his career as a very promising Georgian writer
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.160]   writing in Georgian.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.880]   So he's not doing that for some personal affinity
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.960]   or cultural intellectual roots
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.960]   within Russian nation or Russian people.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:40.320]   He is doing that for the sake of the success
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.240]   of his Soviet and communist project.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.400]   And he has to get the largest ethnic group on board,
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.880]   which are Russians.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.980]   But Stalin and Putin have different understanding
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.220]   who Russians are.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:59.800]   Stalin already accepted Ukrainians and Belarusians.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.360]   Their existence, Putin goes back to pre-Stalin
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:05.040]   and pre-Lenin times.
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:10.040]   - So if we step back from the historical context of this
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.160]   and maybe the geopolitical purpose of writing such an essay
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.860]   and forget about the essay altogether.
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:21.560]   You know, I have family in Ukraine and Russia.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.180]   I know a lot of people in Ukraine and Russia.
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.920]   Forget the war, forget all of this.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:31.940]   There's a kind of, they all kind of sound the same.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:36.560]   Like if I go to France,
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.160]   they sound different than in Ukraine and Russia.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:45.160]   Like if you lay out the cultural map of the world,
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.980]   there's just a different beat and music
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:49.300]   and flavor to a people.
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:52.520]   I guess what I'm trying to say is there seems to be
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:55.660]   a closeness between the cultures of Ukraine and Russia.
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.180]   And how do we describe that?
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.880]   Do we acknowledge that?
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:04.880]   And how does that attention with the national independence?
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:10.120]   - First of all, especially when it comes to Eastern Ukraine
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:15.120]   or to big cities, many people in Ukraine spoke Russian.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.100]   Generally, it's the same language.
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:22.720]   On the top of that, we started our discussion
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.320]   with talking about the Slavs, right?
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.340]   So both Ukrainian and Russian language are Slavic languages.
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:33.080]   So there is proximity there as well.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.440]   On the top of that, there is a history of existence
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:40.520]   in the Soviet Union and before that in one empire
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.600]   for a long period of time.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.600]   So you see a lot of before the war,
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.880]   a lot of Ukrainian singers and entertainers
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:52.880]   performing in Russia and vice versa.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.720]   Biography of President Zelensky is certainly one of the,
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:02.080]   fits that particular model as well.
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.180]   That all talks about similarities.
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:11.180]   But these similarities also very often obscure
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:16.320]   things that became so important in the course of this war.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.220]   And I already mentioned the book titled
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:25.500]   by President Kuchma of Ukraine, "Ukraine is not Russia."
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.320]   So that's the argument.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.800]   Despite the fact that you think that we are the same,
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.980]   we behave differently.
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:35.900]   And it turned out that they behave differently.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:39.720]   You have Bolotnaya in Moscow and police violence
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.520]   and that's the end of it.
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.520]   You have the Maidan in Ukraine and you have police violence
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.560]   and that's the beginning.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:50.280]   That's not the end.
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:55.280]   History really matters in the way why
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:59.080]   sometimes people speak in the same language
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.640]   with different accents behave very differently.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:07.220]   Russia and Russian identity was formed around the state
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:11.740]   and has difficulty imagining itself outside of the state.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.740]   And that state happened to be imperial
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:15.860]   for most of Russian history.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.620]   Ukrainian project came into existence
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:21.020]   in revolt against the state.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:25.680]   Ukraine came into existence out of the parts
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:28.220]   of different empires which means they left
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:30.580]   different cultural impact on them.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:32.780]   And for Ukrainians to stay together,
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.660]   autocratic regime so far didn't work.
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.980]   It's like the colonies of the United States.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:42.560]   You have to find common language.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.180]   You have to talk to each other.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:50.180]   And that became part of the Ukrainian political DNA.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:54.780]   And that became a huge factor in the war.
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:58.360]   And very few people in Ukraine believed
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.700]   what Vladimir Putin was saying,
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.800]   that Russians and Ukrainians were one and the same people.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.800]   But the majority believed that they're certainly close
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.260]   culturally and historically nations.
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:13.360]   And from that point of view,
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.660]   the bombardment of the Ukrainian cities
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:19.280]   became such a shock to the Ukrainians.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.080]   Because deep down, they maybe looked at Syria,
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:27.160]   they looked at Chechnya and were explaining that
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.820]   through the fact that there was basically
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:32.100]   such a big cultural gap and difference
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:36.920]   between Russians and those countries and those nations.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:40.500]   But my understanding, at least,
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.700]   most of them had difficulty imagining
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:46.700]   the war of that proportion and that sort of ferocity
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:49.460]   and that sort of war crimes,
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:54.460]   the bringing that sort of war crimes and on that level.
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:57.380]   - It's interesting that you say that
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:00.440]   in the DNA of Ukraine versus Russia,
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:05.440]   so maybe Russia is more conducive to authoritarian regimes
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:13.320]   and Ukraine is more conducive to defining itself
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.380]   by rebelling against authoritarian regimes.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:19.880]   - By rebellion, absolutely.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:23.840]   And that was the story pretty much before 1991.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.660]   So what you see since 1991 and what you see today
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:31.720]   is, I would say, a new factor,
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.200]   certainly in Ukrainian modern history.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:35.920]   Because Ukrainians traditionally
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:38.360]   were very successful rebels.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.800]   The largest peasant army in the civil war
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.300]   in the Russian Empire was the Mahmo army
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:47.480]   in southern Ukraine.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.680]   And one revolt, Kazakh revolts and other revolts,
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:54.320]   one after another.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.320]   But Ukrainians had historically difficulty
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:00.360]   actually maintaining the sort of freedom
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.920]   that they acquired.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.640]   Had difficulty associating themselves with the state.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:10.880]   And what we see, especially in the last two years,
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:14.680]   it's a quite phenomenal development in Ukraine
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.400]   when Ukrainians associate themselves with the state,
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:23.400]   where Ukrainians see a state not just as a foreigner,
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.000]   as historically it was in Ukrainian history,
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.720]   not just someone who came to take,
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:32.520]   but the state that is continuation of them,
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:36.360]   that helps to provide security for them,
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.420]   that the Ukrainian armed forces,
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:41.460]   even before the start of this war,
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:46.460]   had the highest support and popularity in Ukraine.
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:51.460]   The state today functions unbelievably effectively
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:55.540]   under attacks and missile attacks.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:59.340]   And again, city government and local government.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:03.900]   And we are witnessing, when it comes to Ukraine,
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:07.660]   we are witnessing a very important historical development
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:12.660]   where Ukrainians found their state for the first time
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:15.420]   through most of their history.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:20.420]   And try to make a transition from successful rebels
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:25.680]   to successful managers and state builders.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:27.180]   - Yeah.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:29.720]   I talked to John Mearsheimer recently.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.940]   There's a lot of people that believe NATO
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:36.260]   had a big contribution to the Russian invasion
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:37.420]   of Ukraine in 2022.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:42.100]   So what role did NATO play in this full history
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:47.980]   from Bucharest in 2008 to today?
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:53.940]   - NATO was a big part, certainly,
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:58.040]   of the Russian justification for the war.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:02.820]   That was the thing that was up there
[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:05.680]   in the months leading to the aggression.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:12.240]   The truth is that, and Vladimir Putin went on records,
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:16.540]   sustained that, that the Western leaders
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:18.340]   were telling him again and again
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:21.500]   that there is no chance for Ukraine
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:25.080]   to become member of NATO anytime soon.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:29.820]   Russia was very effective back in the year 208
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:33.460]   in stopping Ukraine and Georgia
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:36.860]   on the path of joining NATO.
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:38.580]   There was a Bucharest summit
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:42.740]   at which the US president at that time,
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.580]   George W. Bush, was pushing for the membership
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:51.300]   and Putin convinced leaders of France and Germany
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:54.560]   to block that membership.
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:59.560]   And after that, membership for Ukraine and for Georgia
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:05.580]   was really removed from the realistic agenda for NATO.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:11.020]   And that's what the leaders of the Western world
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:15.020]   in the month leading to the February 2022 aggression
[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:19.500]   were trying to convey to Vladimir Putin.
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:22.620]   What he wanted, there was an ultimatum
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:27.620]   that really was there not to start negotiations,
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:30.020]   but really to stop negotiations.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:32.860]   He demanded the withdrawal of NATO
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:37.460]   to the borders of the 1997, if I am not mistaken.
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:40.300]   So completely something that neither leaders
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:43.860]   would accept nor the countries members of NATO would accept.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:48.520]   But for me, it's very clear that that was an excuse,
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.700]   that that was a justification.
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:55.620]   And what happened later in the year 2022 and 2023
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.860]   certainly confirms me in that belief.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:05.540]   Finland joined NATO and Sweden is on the way to join in NATO.
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.140]   So Finland joined in NATO increased border
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:17.160]   between Russia and NATO twofold and probably more than that.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:20.600]   So if NATO is the real concern,
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.820]   it would be probably not completely unreasonable
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.660]   to expect that if not every single soldier,
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:32.540]   but at least half of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:37.540]   would be moved to protect the new border with NATO in Finland.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:42.580]   So I have no doubt that no one in Kremlin
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:46.000]   either in the past or today looks favorably
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000]   or is excited about NATO moving
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.980]   or the countries of Eastern Europe joining NATO.
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:59.960]   But I have very difficult time imagining
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:02.860]   that that was the primary cause of the war.
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:07.380]   And what we see also, we talked about Tucker's interview.
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:12.260]   He was surprised, but he believed that Putin
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:17.260]   was completely honest when the first 25 minutes of interview
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:20.220]   he was talking about relations between Russia and Ukraine,
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.180]   was talking about history.
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:27.180]   And that was also the main focus of his essay.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.600]   Essay was not on NATO and Russia.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.040]   Essay was on Russia and Ukraine.
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.100]   So that is where the real causes are.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:40.160]   The broader context is the fall of empire
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:42.900]   and process of disintegration of empire,
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:45.360]   not the story of NATO.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.360]   - What was, to clarify, the reason Putin,
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.600]   Russia, engaged in Ukraine in 2022?
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.400]   - The immediate goal in 2014, when the war started,
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.360]   was to stop the drift of Ukraine toward the West
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.740]   and outside of the Russian sphere of influence.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:11.740]   The invasion of 2022 perceived the same goals,
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:19.320]   keeping Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:24.320]   Once we have the resistance, quite effective resistance
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:30.200]   on the part of Ukraine, the Ramstein and coalition,
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:33.000]   international coalition in support of Ukraine,
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.560]   then we see the realization of plan B,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.560]   where parts of Ukrainian territory are being annexed
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.540]   and included in the constitution of the Russian Federation.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:47.280]   So the two scenarios don't exclude each other,
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.580]   but if scenario number one doesn't work,
[02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:56.580]   then scenario number two goes into play.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:59.700]   - In the Gates of Kiev chapter,
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:02.320]   you write about Volodymyr Zalensky
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.600]   in the early days of the war.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:08.440]   What are most important moments to you about this time,
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:12.960]   the first hours and days of the invasion?
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.920]   - The first hours and the first days
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.140]   were the most difficult, psychologically.
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.880]   The rest of the world really didn't expect Kiev
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.920]   to last for more than a few days,
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:27.560]   didn't expect Ukraine to last for more than a few weeks.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.020]   And all the data suggested that that's what would happen.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.320]   Ukraine would collapse, would be taken over.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:41.080]   Putin called his war a special military operation,
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.680]   which suggests you also expectations about the scope,
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:46.400]   expectations about the time.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:51.060]   So semi-military, semi-police, police operation.
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:55.200]   So every reasonable person in the world
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.560]   believed that that would happen.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:03.780]   And it's the heroism of quote-unquote unreasonable people,
[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:07.120]   like Zalensky, like the commander
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.480]   of Ukrainian Armed Forces, Zaluzny,
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:13.100]   like mayors of the cities, Klitschko and others,
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:16.480]   I'm just naming names that are familiar
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:18.940]   to almost all of us now.
[02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:21.440]   But there are thousands of those people,
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:25.820]   unreasonable people, who decided that it was unreasonable
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.280]   to attack their country.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:33.160]   And that was the most difficult times and days.
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:38.860]   And speaking about Zalensky, every,
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:41.920]   I understand, reasonable leader in the West
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.380]   was trying to convince him to leave Ukraine
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:49.220]   and to set a government in exile in Poland or in London.
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:55.240]   And it was reasonable to accept one of his predecessors,
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.040]   Mr. Yanukovych, flat cave.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:01.720]   A few months before that in Afghanistan,
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:04.480]   the president of Afghanistan fled Afghanistan.
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:08.820]   That was a reasonable thing to expect.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:14.880]   And he turned out to be very, very unreasonable
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.880]   in that sense, that comes with the gods,
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:22.240]   his gods and God's people around him
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:23.920]   and Ukrainians in general.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.660]   - Why do you think you stayed in Kiev,
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:30.660]   this former comedian who played a president on TV,
[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:36.960]   when Kiev is being invaded by the second most powerful
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.600]   military in the world?
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.340]   - Because I think he believes in things.
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:48.120]   And one of those things was that if he,
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:53.040]   a president and he is in the presidential office,
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:56.000]   he is there to play his role to the end.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.060]   And another thing, my personal,
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.500]   again, I never met Volodymyr Zalensky.
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:09.620]   My personal understanding of him is that he has talent
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:15.380]   that helped him in his career before the presidency
[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:17.340]   and then helps now.
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:22.340]   He fills the audience and then channels the attitude
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:26.800]   of the audience and amplifies it.
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:32.920]   And I think that another reason why he didn't leave Kiev
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.780]   was that he filled the audience.
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:40.520]   The audience in that particular context were the Ukrainians.
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:44.320]   - So he had a sense that the Ukrainians would unify
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:46.160]   because he was quite, if you look at the polls
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.640]   before the war, quite unpopular.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:53.200]   And there was still divisions and factions
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.980]   and the government is divided.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:57.120]   I mean, there's the East and the West
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:58.680]   and all this kind of stuff.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:02.080]   You think he had a sense that this could unite people?
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:06.100]   - The East and the West was not already such an issue
[02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:11.100]   after Crimea and part of Donbas being gone.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:16.840]   So Ukraine was much more united than it was before.
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:23.080]   He brought to power his, before that,
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:26.300]   really non-existent party of regions
[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.940]   on his personal popularity.
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:32.140]   But the important thing is that he created a majority
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:36.620]   in the parliament, which really reflected the unity
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:40.700]   that existed among Ukrainians that was not there before.
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:44.780]   He won with 73% of the population,
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:49.340]   of those who took part in the elections.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:52.360]   His predecessor, Pedro Poroshenko,
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:56.580]   also carried 90% of the precincts.
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:58.380]   And the same happened with Zelensky.
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:03.020]   So the country unified after 2014,
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:06.600]   to a degree it was impossible to imagine before,
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:08.100]   and Zelensky filed that.
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:09.340]   Zelensky knew that.
[02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:15.260]   And that's where the talent of politician really matters.
[02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:23.620]   That's something that you can see beyond just data,
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:26.260]   and you can feel that.
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:28.840]   Apparently, Yeltsin had that ability.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:33.820]   - Why did the peace talks fail?
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:35.420]   There was a lot of peace talks.
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:39.460]   - The main reason is that the conditions
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:44.060]   that Russia was trying to impose on Ukraine
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.180]   were basically unacceptable for Ukraine.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:53.340]   Because one of the conditions apart from this strange thing
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:57.100]   called denazification was, of course,
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:00.180]   de facto loss of the territory, and for the future,
[02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:06.260]   really staying outside either of NATO or any Western support,
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:11.940]   which was very clear, you can buy a couple of weeks,
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:13.620]   you can buy a couple of months,
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.060]   but in the conditions like that,
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:19.720]   Russia will come back tomorrow and will take over everything.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.660]   And once Ukrainians realize
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.500]   that they can win on the battlefield,
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:31.740]   once the Russians were defeated and withdraw from Kiev,
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:40.360]   the opportunity emerged to get out of the negotiations,
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.740]   which was very clear, were leading, if not today,
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:47.400]   then tomorrow to the complete destruction of Ukraine.
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.860]   And then, of course, once the territory
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:53.180]   started to be liberated, things like Butchah
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:56.240]   and the massacres of the civilian population
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:59.700]   came to the fore, which made also quite difficult,
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:02.780]   if not impossible, to conduct negotiations
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:05.620]   from this moral and emotional point of view.
[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:09.480]   - What about the claims that Boris Johnson, the West,
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:12.540]   compromised the ability of these peace talks
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:13.720]   to be successful?
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:17.900]   Basically, you kind of manipulated the talks?
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.240]   - I asked people who accompanied Boris Johnson
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:23.960]   to give that question.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:29.260]   The answer was no, and I believed this answer,
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:31.220]   and I'll tell you why.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:36.100]   Because it is very difficult for me
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:40.660]   to imagine President Zelensky
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:47.180]   to take orders from anybody in the world,
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:51.840]   either Boris Johnson or Joe Biden or anybody else,
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:56.840]   and basically doing things that Zelensky believes
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:01.240]   are not in his interest or in the interest of his country.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:05.820]   I just can't imagine that anybody in the world
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:09.500]   telling Zelensky what to do,
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.540]   and Zelensky actually following it against his own,
[02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:17.560]   his own wishes and desires, at least if that is possible,
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.980]   what is in the public sphere
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:23.380]   doesn't allow us to suggest that it is.
[02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:25.820]   - That said, Zelensky is a smart man,
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:30.340]   and he knows that the war can only continue
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.100]   with the West's support.
[02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:35.380]   - That is a different supposition to know
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.960]   that it can continue with the West's support,
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:39.900]   but if we are talking about
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:42.640]   withdrawing from the negotiations,
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:46.580]   that's not about the continuation of the war,
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:49.220]   that you don't need Western support.
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.960]   - Well, what I mean is if he started to sense
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:56.560]   that the West will support no matter what,
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.940]   then maybe the space of decisions you're making
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:12:59.960]   is different.
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:02.880]   - We can interpret that that way,
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:07.040]   but Boris Johnson represented
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.500]   at that point Britain, not the United States.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:16.460]   And really what the war showed,
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:19.320]   and it was clear already at that time,
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:22.620]   that what was needed was massive support
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.560]   from the West as a whole.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:28.680]   And the promise of that support came only
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:31.880]   after the West realized that Ukraine can win
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.060]   and came only in late April,
[02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:40.500]   with the Rammstein, so at least a few weeks later.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.900]   So I don't know how much Boris Johnson could promise.
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:46.980]   He probably could promise to try to help
[02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:50.540]   and try to convince and try to work on that.
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:53.040]   If Zelensky acted on that promise,
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.700]   he certainly was taking a risk.
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:56.220]   But the key issue, again,
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:58.420]   I am going back where I started,
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:02.280]   it's principle and acceptance for Ukraine,
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.700]   the conditions that were offered.
[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:06.760]   And Ukraine was,
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:10.600]   the moment they saw the possibility
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.700]   that they could fight back,
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:15.940]   with Johnson's support, without Johnson's support,
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:17.980]   they took the chance.
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:20.840]   - So what are the ways this war can end, do you think?
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:23.900]   What are the different possible trajectories,
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.620]   whether it's peace talks,
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:28.740]   what does winning look like for either side,
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:30.020]   what is the role of US,
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:32.700]   what trajectories do you see that are possible?
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:36.100]   - It's a question on the one level,
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:40.060]   very easy to answer, on the other, very difficult.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:43.260]   The level on which it is very easy,
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.980]   it's a broad historical perspective.
[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:49.780]   If you really believe, and I believe in that,
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:53.340]   that this is the war of the Soviet succession,
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:57.500]   that this is the war of the disintegration of empire,
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:59.220]   you know how the story ends.
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:04.820]   And they end with disintegration of empire,
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:07.660]   they end with the rise of the new states
[02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:10.940]   and the parents of the new colored sports on the map.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.900]   That's the story that started with the American Revolution.
[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:18.300]   So that's long-term perspective.
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:21.540]   The difficult part is, of course, what will happen tomorrow.
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:25.020]   The difficult part is what they will be
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:29.640]   in two days or even in two years.
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:32.040]   And in very broad terms,
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.180]   the war can end in one of three scenarios,
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:40.220]   the victory of one side, the victory of another side,
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:43.140]   and a sort of a stalemate and compromise,
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:46.300]   especially when it comes to the territories.
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:52.340]   This war is already approaching the end of the second year.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:57.220]   I follow the news and look analysis,
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:00.520]   I don't remember one single piece suggesting
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:03.400]   that the next year will bring peace
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.300]   or will bring peace for sure.
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:11.520]   And we are in a situation where both sides still believe
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:18.600]   that they can achieve something or improve their position
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:20.140]   on the battlefield.
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:24.220]   Certainly that was the expectations of Ukrainian side
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:28.600]   back in the summer and early fall of 2023.
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.380]   And from what I understand now,
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:35.380]   this is certainly the expectations of the Russian side today.
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:41.420]   This is the largest war in Europe since World War II,
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:44.900]   the largest war in the world since Korean War.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:51.060]   And we know that the Korean War ended
[02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:55.780]   in this division of Korea,
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:59.980]   but the negotiations were going on for more than two years.
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:02.100]   While those negotiations were going on,
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:05.420]   both sides were trying to improve their position there.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:09.020]   And until there was a political change,
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:14.020]   death of Stalin, arrival of Eisenhower in the United States,
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:18.380]   and the realization that the chances of succeeding
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:23.380]   on the battlefield are huge, the peace talks didn't come.
[02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:28.260]   So at this point, all three scenarios are possible.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:31.440]   I don't really discount any of them.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:34.620]   It's early to say what will happen.
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:36.780]   - So without any political change,
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:40.280]   let's try to imagine what are the possibilities
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:41.760]   that the war ends this year?
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:47.960]   Is it possible that it can end with compromise,
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:49.860]   basically at the place it started?
[02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:52.700]   - Meaning back to the borders of 2022?
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:55.160]   - Yeah, back to the borders of '22
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:57.860]   with some security guarantees
[02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:01.860]   that aren't really guarantees, but are hopeful guarantees.
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:05.580]   - No, it is not just virtual impossibility.
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:08.980]   It is impossible without political change in Moscow.
[02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:13.780]   The reason is that back in the fall of 2022,
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:21.180]   Vladimir Putin included five of Ukrainian region's oblasts,
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:25.000]   even those that he didn't control or didn't control fully
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.220]   into the Russian constitution,
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:29.440]   which basically, in simple language,
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.000]   is that the hands are tied up not only for Putin himself,
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.700]   but also for his possible successors.
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:40.700]   So that means that no return to the borders of 2022
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:45.000]   without political change in Moscow are possible.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:50.840]   A few days after that decision in Moscow,
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:55.840]   Zelensky issued a decree saying
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:58.320]   that no negotiations with Russia.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.360]   What that really meant in plain language
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.240]   is that basically we are not prepared
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.040]   to negotiate a stable agreement with five of our oblasts,
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.120]   not just the next,
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:12.760]   but also included into the Russian constitution.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.760]   So that's where we are, so that scenario is,
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:21.000]   again, everything is possible, of course,
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.880]   but it's highly, highly unlikely.
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:25.040]   - So the Russian constitution is a thing
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.680]   that makes this all very difficult.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:30.440]   - Yes, and not only as a negotiation tactic
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:34.380]   for Putin or whoever would negotiate on the Russian side,
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:37.260]   but also as a legal issue.
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:40.160]   - So the practical aspect of it, even, is difficult.
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.080]   You really have to change the constitution
[02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.800]   before the peace agreement takes hold
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.880]   or immediately after that.
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.840]   And with the Minsk agreements,
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:54.540]   that was one of the things that Russia wanted from Ukraine,
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.240]   change of the constitution,
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.720]   and it turned out to be really impossible.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:03.400]   So that's one of the backstories of the Minsk
[02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.680]   and collapse of the Minsk agreements.
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:08.060]   - Is there something like Minsk agreements
[02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:11.520]   that are possible now to, maybe this is a legal question,
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:13.100]   but to override the constitution,
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.680]   to sort of shake everything up?
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.720]   So see the constitutional amendment
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:22.000]   as just a negotiation tactic,
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.120]   to come to the table to something like Minsk agreement.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:29.560]   - Given how fast those amendments
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:31.480]   to the constitution were adopted,
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:37.080]   that suggests that really executive power in Russia
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:41.560]   has enormous power over the legislative branch.
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.880]   So it's, again, difficult to imagine,
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:45.920]   but technically this is possible again,
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:50.580]   but possible if there is a political change in Moscow.
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:53.140]   - I don't understand why assuming political change
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.860]   in Moscow is not possible this year.
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.740]   So I'm trying to see if there's a way
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:59.780]   to end this war this year, right?
[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:03.260]   - There is a possibility of armistice, right?
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:07.240]   But armistice more along the, like any armistice,
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.320]   along the lines of the current front lines.
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:13.820]   But withdrawal of the Russian troops
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:17.180]   to the borders of 2022 at this point,
[02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:19.020]   whether it's reasonable or unreasonable,
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.400]   can be achieved all only as the result
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:23.620]   of the defeat of the Russian army,
[02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:25.260]   like it happened near Kiev.
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:26.560]   Is it possible, possible?
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:30.620]   Is it likely, especially given what is happening
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:35.460]   with the Western support, military support for Ukraine?
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:36.380]   Probably not.
[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:40.460]   - But if Putin, the executive branch, has a lot of power,
[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:43.780]   why can't the United States president,
[02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:45.920]   the Russian president, the Ukrainian president
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:48.340]   come to the table and draw up something
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:51.060]   like the Minsk agreements where,
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:54.260]   and then rapid constitutional changes made,
[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:58.220]   and you go back to the borders of 2022, before 2022,
[02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:02.540]   like through agreements, through compromise,
[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:03.540]   impossible for you?
[02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:05.300]   - Certainly not this year.
[02:22:05.300 --> 02:22:09.940]   I look at this year as the time when at least one side,
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:14.500]   Russian side, will try to get as much as it can
[02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:17.020]   through the, through military means.
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:19.460]   - But that's been happening last year too.
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:22.420]   There's been a counter-offensive, there's been attempts.
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:27.420]   - It doesn't mean that every, that new year somehow
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:29.340]   is supposed to bring new tactics.
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:35.460]   That, the last year was pretty much a lot of fighting,
[02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:41.500]   a lot of suffering, very little movement of the frontline.
[02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:45.680]   The biggest change of the last year was Ukraine victory
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.680]   on the Black Sea, where they pushed the Russian Navy
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:54.920]   into the western part of the pond,
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:59.920]   and restored the grain corridor and export from Odessa,
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:06.020]   apparently up to 75% of what it used to be before the war.
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.360]   So that's the only major change.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.360]   But again, the price is enormous in terms of wealth,
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.940]   in terms of, especially in terms of lives.
[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:20.760]   - So thinking about what 2024 brings,
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.900]   Zelensky just fired Ukraine's head of the army,
[02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:29.820]   a man you've mentioned, General Valery Zaluzny.
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.980]   What do you make of this development?
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:36.980]   - This is a very, very dangerous moment in the war.
[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:42.700]   The reason for that is that Zaluzny is someone
[02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:44.600]   who is very popular with the army,
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.900]   and with people in general.
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:51.940]   So if you look at that through American prism,
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:56.940]   that would be something analogous to President Truman
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:24:00.200]   firing General MacArthur,
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:06.940]   given that stakes for U.S. at that time were very high,
[02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:11.020]   but probably not as high as they are for Ukraine today.
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:17.120]   In both cases, what is at stake is certainly the idea
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:20.300]   that the political leadership and military leadership
[02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:22.320]   have to be on the same page.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.320]   And the question is whether, on the part of Zelensky,
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:31.460]   this is just the change of the leadership,
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:36.340]   or this is also the change of his approach to the war.
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:39.380]   And that can mean many things.
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:42.820]   One can mean him taking more active part
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:45.420]   in planning operations.
[02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:49.600]   It can mean also possible change of the tactic
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:53.760]   in the war, given that counteroffensive didn't work out.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.700]   We don't know yet.
[02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:59.320]   I don't know whether President Zelensky at this point
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:03.000]   knows exactly what will come next.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.780]   But this is the time when the change of the leadership
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:10.100]   in the country and in the army that is at war,
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:14.860]   it's one of the most trying, most dangerous moments.
[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:17.700]   - So the thing that President Zelensky expressed
[02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:21.720]   is that this is going to be a change of tactics,
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:25.820]   making the approach more technologically advanced,
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:26.960]   this kind of things.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:32.920]   But as you said, I believe he is less popular
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:37.580]   than the chief of the army, Zelensky,
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:40.780]   80% to 60%, depending on the polls.
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:45.100]   Do you think it's possible that Zelensky's days are numbered
[02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:49.620]   as the president, and that somebody like Zelushny
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:52.020]   comes to power?
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:55.900]   - What we know is that in this war,
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:02.680]   Ukrainian people really united around their president.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:07.580]   And the armed forces were always,
[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:09.020]   even before the start of the war,
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:11.920]   more popular than was the presidential office.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:16.780]   So the change, if it happened in that realm,
[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:19.660]   was not so dramatic.
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:24.560]   And from what I can see from social media in Ukraine,
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.780]   there is a lot of unhappiness, a lot of questions,
[02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:33.780]   but there is also realization, very strong realization
[02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:35.880]   that the country has to stay united.
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:41.420]   And certainly the behavior of Zelushny himself
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:45.820]   is there basically not suggesting any sort of a
[02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:49.020]   precaution type of scenario.
[02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:54.020]   That gives me some hope, actually a lot of hope.
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:58.640]   And in terms of whether Zelensky's days are numbered or not,
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.180]   I don't think they're numbered.
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:04.340]   But if Ukraine stays a democracy,
[02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:06.620]   and I believe it will stay,
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:11.620]   what comes to my mind is the story of Churchill,
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:19.540]   the story of De Gaulle in Poland, the story of Pilsudski.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.540]   So once the war is over, really,
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:26.000]   the electorate in the democratic elections,
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.620]   they want to change the political leadership.
[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:31.580]   They want to move forward.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:34.860]   But Pilsudski came back to power,
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:37.220]   and De Gaulle came back to power,
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:39.260]   and Churchill came back to power.
[02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:44.100]   So no, whatever happens in the short run
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:49.100]   or medium term run, I think that Zelensky's days
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:50.820]   in politics are not numbered.
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:54.860]   - So what to you is interesting, for example,
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:56.500]   if I get a chance to interview Zelensky,
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.940]   what to you is interesting about the person
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:02.380]   that would be good to ask about, to explore,
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:04.060]   about the state of his mind, his thinking,
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:06.320]   his view of the world as it stands today.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:10.660]   - Next month, we're supposed to take place
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:12.580]   Ukrainian elections.
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:14.360]   They're not taking place,
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.040]   because the majority of Ukrainians don't think
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.900]   this is the right thing to do, to change the president,
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.280]   to have the elections, to have a political struggle
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:25.540]   in the middle of the war.
[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:30.340]   So Zelensky refused to call those elections
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:35.100]   despite the fact that he is and continues
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:37.620]   to be the most popular politician in Ukraine,
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:39.780]   so it would be to his benefit,
[02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:43.540]   but that's clearly not what the Ukrainians want.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:47.500]   But the question of continuing as the president
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:51.860]   beyond five years also, one way or another,
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:54.180]   would raise questions about the legitimacy.
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:58.640]   And certainly Russia will be playing this card
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:28:59.940]   like there is no tomorrow.
[02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:04.940]   And what I would be interested in asking Zelensky about,
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:09.880]   whether he sees that his second term,
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:12.300]   which comes on those conditions,
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:17.300]   would suggest a different attitude over the opposition,
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:22.700]   maybe some form of the coalition government
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:26.020]   like it was the case in Britain with Churchill
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:28.300]   under different circumstances, of course,
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.380]   or this is basically, in his opinion,
[02:29:30.380 --> 02:29:32.300]   something that would be destructive
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:35.780]   and something that would really be an impediment
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:40.380]   for the question of unity and war effort.
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:45.380]   And I would ask this question not to basically suggest
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:47.920]   that that's the way to go,
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:52.300]   but I would be very much interested to hear
[02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:54.460]   what his thinking about that is.
[02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:56.960]   - Do you think there's a degree during wartime
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:01.680]   that the power that comes with being a war president
[02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:03.480]   can corrupt the person?
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:08.480]   Sort of push you away from the democratic mindset
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:13.640]   towards an authoritarian one?
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:17.720]   - I think that there is a possibility of that, right?
[02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:22.720]   In the conditions of any emergency,
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.320]   the war, in the case of the Soviet Union,
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:28.920]   there was a Chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth.
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.160]   You make decisions much faster,
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.640]   you create this vertical,
[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:40.640]   and then it's very easy to get really used to that way,
[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:46.440]   dealing with the issues in the conditions of emergency, right?
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:51.440]   And then they continue emergency or with no emergency,
[02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:55.440]   they are continuing the emergency mode.
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:31:00.440]   I think, again, that would be a very natural thing
[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:05.080]   for any human being to do to make it easier.
[02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:09.880]   Should I do that easier and in a more effective way,
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:11.720]   or should I do it the right way?
[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:13.400]   That's a challenge.
[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:17.680]   Sometimes it's difficult to answer this question.
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:20.020]   - Let me stay in power for just a little longer
[02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:21.880]   to do it the efficient way.
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:23.760]   And then time flies away
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.080]   and all of a sudden you're going for the third term
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:28.920]   and the fourth term.
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:30.600]   - And suddenly it's easy to realize
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:32.680]   that actually you can't rule in any other way.
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:37.680]   You just, whatever skills you had of people around
[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:40.000]   that can help is that already gone.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.760]   - Exactly, the people that surround you
[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:46.360]   are not providing the kind of critical feedback
[02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:48.400]   necessary for a democratic system.
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.960]   One of the things that Tucker said
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:52.880]   after his interview with Putin,
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:56.720]   he was just in his hotel, just chatting on video.
[02:31:56.720 --> 02:32:01.720]   And he said that he felt like Putin
[02:32:01.720 --> 02:32:06.060]   was not very good at explaining himself,
[02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:10.360]   like a coherent whole narrative
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:13.800]   of why the invasion happened and it's just this big picture.
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:17.460]   And he said, that's not because he doesn't have one,
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:22.460]   but it's been a long time since he's had somebody around him
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:25.180]   where he has to explain himself to.
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:28.320]   So he's out of practice, which is very interesting.
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.820]   It's a very interesting point.
[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:33.860]   And that's what war and being in power
[02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:35.900]   for a prolonged period of time can do.
[02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:39.860]   So on that topic, if you had a chance to talk to Putin,
[02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:42.500]   what kind of questions would you ask him?
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:44.780]   What would you like to find out about the man
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:46.240]   as he stands today?
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:48.460]   - As a historian, I have a lot of questions
[02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:53.320]   and I have questions about when the decision was made
[02:32:53.320 --> 02:32:57.280]   to attack Ukraine and what went into this decision
[02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:00.600]   because we are thinking about that, we are trying.
[02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:05.040]   So as a historian, I have this big question,
[02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:09.700]   a question about the Crimea when those decisions were made.
[02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:14.080]   So that sort of questions that interests me,
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:17.340]   but the rest either I think that I understand
[02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:18.700]   what is going on with him
[02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:21.220]   or I don't expect the answer that can help.
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.680]   For example, a good question,
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:28.680]   whether you regret or not the start of the war in 2022,
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:34.300]   given the enormous, enormous casualties on both sides,
[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:38.680]   but you can't expect from a politician
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:42.420]   an honest answer to this question, right?
[02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:46.780]   So there are questions to which I know he can't answer,
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:48.320]   honestly, and then there are other questions
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:51.580]   to which I think he already provided all answers
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:52.780]   that he could.
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:57.780]   So what for me is of interest are basically questions
[02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:01.180]   for a historian about the timing
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:04.820]   and the logic of particular decisions.
[02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:08.700]   - Well, I do wonder how different what he says publicly
[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:10.980]   is from what he thinks privately.
[02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:15.100]   So a question about when the decision
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:18.700]   to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question
[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:22.500]   to give insight to the difference
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:24.380]   between how he thinks about the world privately
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:26.220]   versus what he says publicly.
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:32.460]   And same about other, you know, about empire.
[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:34.220]   Because if you ask Putin,
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:36.340]   he will say he has no interest in empire
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:37.860]   and he finds the notion silly.
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:43.340]   But at the same time, perhaps privately,
[02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:47.180]   there's a sense in which he does seek
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:52.180]   the reunification of the Russian Empire.
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:54.900]   - Not in the form of the Russian Empire,
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:57.020]   not in the form of the Soviet Union,
[02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:59.940]   but certainly in some form of the Russian control.
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:04.940]   That's, for me at least, it's quite clear.
[02:35:05.980 --> 02:35:10.980]   Otherwise there would be no busts to the Russian emperors
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:17.140]   and Catherine and Peter and others.
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:20.740]   - You wrote in your book titled
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:25.000]   The Frontline Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.540]   about the Russian question,
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:33.180]   I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn, first in 1994.
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:36.860]   Solzhenitsyn, of course, is the author of Gulag Archipelago.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:38.260]   He's half Ukrainian.
[02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:41.020]   What is the Russian question?
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:45.180]   - Solzhenitsyn clearly identifies himself as Russian.
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:50.260]   And his opposition to the communist regime
[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:53.760]   was a position of a Russian nationalist.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.860]   So his argument was that communism was bad for Russia.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000]   And for him, Russian question is about the ethnic Russians,
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.780]   but also he was thinking about Russians in Putin's terms,
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:18.980]   or Putin thinks in Solzhenitsyn's terms,
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:21.180]   about Ukrainians and Belarusians
[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:23.120]   constituting part of that.
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:25.680]   So the Russian question is the biggest tragedy
[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:29.020]   of the 20th century, the division of the Russians,
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:31.800]   the loss of the statehood and division of the Russians
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:34.820]   between different states.
[02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:39.460]   This is for Solzhenitsyn's Russian question.
[02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:44.460]   And his original idea and plan was presented
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:49.260]   in the essay that he published in 1990,
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:52.480]   which was called How We Should Restructure Russia.
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:55.020]   And Restructure Russia meant getting rid
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:59.600]   of the Baltics, Central Asia, and Caucuses,
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:03.620]   and have Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians,
[02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:06.500]   including those who live in Northern Kazakhstan,
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:09.380]   to create one nation state.
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:11.540]   So he was a Russian nationalist,
[02:37:11.540 --> 02:37:15.020]   but he was thinking about Russian nation state
[02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:18.600]   as the state of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians.
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:21.760]   And once the Soviet Union collapsed
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:25.060]   and his idea was not implemented,
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:28.500]   in the 1990s he formulated Plan B,
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:34.400]   taken over by Russia of Donbas, Crimea, and Southern Ukraine,
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:40.100]   the areas that now are included in the Russian Constitution.
[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:45.460]   So in terms, in historical terms and intellectual terms,
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.940]   what is happening today in the war
[02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:53.720]   between Russia and Ukraine is the division
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:57.060]   on one level or another level
[02:37:57.060 --> 02:38:01.120]   that was formulated by the noble laureate,
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:04.900]   Alexander Solzhenitsyn, half Russian, half Ukrainian.
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:06.260]   - If there is such a thing,
[02:38:06.260 --> 02:38:09.580]   what would you say is the Ukrainian question
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:10.760]   as we stand today?
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:13.260]   - The Ukrainian question is very simple.
[02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:18.120]   It's now, it's not anymore acquisition of the nation state,
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:20.820]   but actually a sovereign state.
[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:23.080]   But it's maintenance.
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:27.840]   So it's Ukrainian question is like dozens of other questions
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.500]   in the 20th and 21st century.
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.680]   The rise of the new state.
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.280]   And that's what is the Ukrainian question,
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:40.680]   whether Ukraine will continue to its existence
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:42.860]   as a nation, as an independent state,
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:46.960]   because that existence has been questioned
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:50.140]   by stating that Russians and Ukrainians
[02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:51.280]   are one and the same people,
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:54.560]   which the fact is saying, "Your guy is Russian."
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:58.720]   And also trying to destroy the state.
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:01.680]   - Is it possible that if the war in Ukraine continues
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:04.060]   for many more years,
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:08.580]   that the next leader that follows Zelensky
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:11.820]   would take Ukraine away
[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:15.660]   from a sort of democratic Western-style nation
[02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:17.960]   towards a more authoritarian one,
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.440]   maybe even with a far-right influence,
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:22.840]   this kind of direction,
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:25.560]   because of the war, the influence of war?
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:27.200]   - Everything is possible.
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:30.520]   And the longer the war continues,
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:34.760]   the more likely scenario like that becomes.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:38.360]   But realization of that scenario
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:40.480]   would go against the grain
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.160]   of largest part of Ukrainian history,
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:50.040]   where Ukraine really emerged
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:51.760]   as a pluralistic state
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:55.720]   in which the elements of democracy were built
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:57.780]   in the last 30 years,
[02:39:57.780 --> 02:40:01.960]   would go against the grain of the Ukrainian society,
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:05.720]   where as one author formulated in the 1990s,
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:10.280]   he wrote a book, "Ukrainian Nationalism and Minority Faith,"
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:12.480]   where the nationalist was a minority faith,
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:15.360]   and radical nationalism continues to be,
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.120]   or at least continue to be in 2019 a minority faith
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:21.040]   during the last elections.
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:24.880]   So possible but unlikely given the historical realities
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:27.420]   of the last 30-plus years.
[02:40:27.420 --> 02:40:30.360]   - I could talk to you for many more hours
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:34.840]   on Chernobyl alone.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.320]   Since you've written a book on Chernobyl and nuclear disaster,
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.220]   there's just a million possible conversations here.
[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:43.160]   But let me just jump around history a little bit.
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:47.580]   Back to World War II, back before World War II,
[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:51.180]   my grandmother lived through Holodomor and World War II,
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:53.400]   Nazi-occupied Ukraine.
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:57.680]   Holodomor, what do you learn,
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:01.080]   let's say about human nature
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.040]   and about governments and nations
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.680]   from the fact that Holodomor happened?
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:11.380]   And maybe you could say what it is and why it happened.
[02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:15.460]   - Holodomor is a massive famine in Ukraine
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.460]   between the years 1932 and 1934.
[02:41:18.460 --> 02:41:24.340]   And it happened as the result
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:28.740]   of forceful collectivization of the agriculture.
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:34.300]   And a tamp on the part of Stalin also
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:38.860]   really roll Ukraine into the Soviet Union
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:43.220]   with basically no potential opposition
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:47.880]   from Ukraine, now national communists.
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:52.860]   So two things came together in December of 1932
[02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:55.180]   when in the same decree,
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:57.100]   Stalin and Molotov signed a decree
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:41:59.820]   on the requisition of the grain,
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:03.320]   which lead eventually to the mass starvation
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:07.100]   and on the banning of Ukrainian language publications
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:12.100]   and education in other Soviet republics outside of Ukraine
[02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:14.940]   and introducing limitations
[02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:18.980]   on the so-called Ukrainianization policies.
[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:23.980]   So on the use of Ukrainian language in Ukraine itself.
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:28.860]   And the numbers are debated.
[02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:34.520]   The numbers that most of the scholars work today
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:35.760]   are four million, but again,
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:40.700]   there are larger numbers as well that circulate.
[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:45.700]   And this is the famine of '32, '33
[02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:50.540]   was not exclusive Ukrainian phenomenon.
[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:55.420]   But most of Ukraine in the Soviet Union died in Ukraine.
[02:42:55.420 --> 02:42:57.480]   And Ukraine was the only place
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:00.540]   where the policy on collecting grain
[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:03.180]   were coming together with the policy
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.180]   of the cleansing of the political leadership,
[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:09.940]   sending people from Moscow to take over the leadership
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:11.860]   and attack on Ukrainian culture.
[02:43:11.860 --> 02:43:17.740]   So in terms of what I learn about human nature,
[02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:23.160]   it's more me learning about the ideologies
[02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:27.680]   of the 20th century, because it's not the only famine
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:29.120]   in the communist lands.
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:32.720]   The famine in China, which was in terms of the numbers,
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:35.120]   much more devastating than that.
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.640]   It's in a different category and for a good reason,
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:38.920]   but you have Holocaust.
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:43.920]   What unites these things is the time.
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:48.080]   This is 20th century.
[02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:53.560]   What unites them are the dominance in the societies
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:54.800]   that are doing that.
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:59.800]   Really, ideologies that not just devalued human life,
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:05.680]   but considered that actually the way forward
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.200]   is by destroying large group of populations
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:12.960]   defined ethnically, religiously, socially, or otherwise.
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:18.120]   Which tells about the time, but tells also about humanity,
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:21.680]   because for centuries before that,
[02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:23.920]   human life was valued.
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:27.240]   There were enemies, but the idea was that human life
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:31.100]   can put and you can, at the end of the day,
[02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:32.200]   there can be slaves.
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:35.560]   There can be, you can use them for productive force.
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:40.440]   Countries in the 18th century with southern Ukraine,
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:42.900]   they were looking for settlers for people to bring
[02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:45.080]   and live on land.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.080]   You move into the 20th century and there is mass destruction
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:52.720]   of the population in the name of ideologies,
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:57.720]   which basically are, by definition, destroy human lives.
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.800]   And that's what's really so shocking and striking,
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:06.800]   because that break was not just with issues of morale,
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:10.240]   not just with issues of humanity,
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.560]   it was any common sense what is happening.
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:19.560]   And I am absolutely convinced
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:22.000]   that we didn't learn the lesson.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.480]   I am absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson.
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:29.880]   With turning our page on fascism and communism,
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:32.980]   we somehow decided that we are free of that.
[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:36.500]   That at least in those terms, history came to an end.
[02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:40.240]   That what is ahead is the future and nothing of that sort
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:44.380]   would happen, would take place to a degree
[02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:46.580]   that people would get in trouble
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:50.580]   for comparing any statements or events
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:55.580]   that are happening today with the communism of fascism.
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:46:02.840]   And so I feel responsibility of myself
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:05.640]   and as a historian in particular
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:11.480]   for not doing a better job about telling people
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:18.540]   that, well, we are who we are
[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:22.400]   and we have as humans our dark side
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:25.680]   and we have to be very careful.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:28.000]   - So there is a human capacity
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.920]   to be captured by an idea, an ideology
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.600]   that claims to bring up a better world,
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:39.600]   as the Nazis did, as Soviet Union did.
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:45.800]   And on the path of doing that devaluing human life,
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:48.400]   that we will bring a better world
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:51.400]   and if millions of people have to be tortured
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:54.700]   on the way to that, all right,
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:56.260]   but at least we have a better world
[02:46:56.260 --> 02:47:00.000]   and human beings are able to, if not accept that,
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:01.480]   look the other way.
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:06.480]   - Yes, and in the name of a particular nation or race,
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:07.960]   like it was the Third Reich
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.720]   or in the name of the humanity of the future.
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:17.720]   So not just devalue human life, destroy human life.
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:20.500]   - Is there something fundamental about communism
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:23.320]   and centralized planning that's part of the problem here?
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.000]   Maybe this also connects the story of Chernobyl
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.320]   where the Chernobyl disaster is not just a story
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:34.800]   of failure of a nuclear power plant,
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:38.920]   but it's an entire institution of,
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:40.480]   the scientific and nuclear institution,
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:42.320]   but the entirety of the government.
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:44.960]   - There is, and there is a number of factors
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:49.960]   of political and social character that produced Chernobyl.
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:55.120]   And one of them is generally the atmosphere of secrecy
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:01.000]   in the Soviet Union in the conditions of the Cold War.
[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:05.840]   The Chernobyl reactor was a dual purpose reactor.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:08.080]   It could boil water today
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:11.040]   and produce enriched uranium tomorrow, right?
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:12.940]   So it was top secret.
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:17.180]   And if there were problems with that reactor,
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:18.800]   those problems were kept secret
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:21.760]   even at people who operated the reactor.
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.560]   That's what happened in Chernobyl.
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:29.120]   Another big, big part of the story,
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:33.820]   which is specifically Soviet,
[02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:37.440]   that's the nature of the managerial culture
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:39.720]   and administrative culture
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:43.400]   in which people had no right to make their own decisions
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.800]   in their place, in their position.
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:50.600]   A few years before the Three Mile Island happened,
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:53.640]   which was a big, big nuclear disaster,
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:58.440]   but in terms of consequences, nothing like Chernobyl.
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.760]   And there in the context of the American legal culture
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:07.760]   and managerial culture, people who were operators
[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:11.600]   who were in managerial positions,
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:15.000]   that was their responsibility to take decisions.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:16.600]   President Carter came there,
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:20.960]   but he was not calling shots on none of those issues.
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:22.320]   What you see with Chernobyl,
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:26.320]   and people who saw HBO series know that very well,
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.520]   the moment the high official arrives,
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.900]   everyone actually falls in line,
[02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:33.820]   it's the official who calls the shot.
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:37.480]   And to move population from the city of Pripyat,
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:42.480]   you needed the okay coming from Moscow from the very top.
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:45.040]   So that is Soviet story.
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:49.960]   And there is a global story of cutting corners
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.580]   to meet the deadlines.
[02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:56.300]   Like it was with that test that they were running
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:00.780]   at that time, or to meet production quarters.
[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:02.980]   This is not just socialist thing.
[02:50:02.980 --> 02:50:06.980]   You can replace production quarters with profit
[02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:14.400]   and you get the same story.
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:19.400]   So some parts in that story are generally reflective
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:23.440]   of our today's world in general.
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:26.920]   Others are very specific, very specific for Soviet Union,
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:28.500]   for Soviet experience.
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:33.500]   And then the biggest probably Soviet part of that story
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:38.640]   is that on the one hand, the government in Moscow and Kiev,
[02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:41.600]   they mobilize all resources to deal with that.
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.800]   But they keep information about what is happening
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:49.840]   and the radiation clouds secret
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:51.920]   from the rest of the population.
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:54.140]   Something that completely would be impossible
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:56.520]   and was impossible in US, in UK,
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:58.880]   where other accidents happened.
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:01.240]   And then guess what?
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:06.240]   A few years later, the Soviet Union collapses very much,
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:10.580]   also thanks to the mobilization of people
[02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:13.740]   over the issue of Chernobyl and nuclear energy
[02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:18.740]   in people writing about that subject,
[02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:23.300]   call it eco-nationalism, ecological nationalism,
[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:28.060]   which comes at least in part from withholding information
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:28.900]   from people.
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:33.120]   And in Ukraine, mobilization didn't start over the issues
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:34.840]   that led to independence,
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:37.180]   didn't start over the issue of language
[02:51:37.180 --> 02:51:41.880]   or didn't start over the issue of national autonomy.
[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:44.420]   It started under the slogans, tell us the truth
[02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:45.480]   about Chernobyl.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:50.840]   We want to know whether we live in contaminated areas or not.
[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:55.080]   And that was a very, very strong factor
[02:51:55.080 --> 02:51:59.300]   that crossed the not just ethnic, religious,
[02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:02.580]   linguistic lines, lines between members of the party
[02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.140]   and not members of the party of the top leadership
[02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:07.020]   and not in military and civilian,
[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:10.300]   because it turned out that the party card
[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:15.300]   didn't protect you from being affected by radiation.
[02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:20.140]   So the all-national mobilization happens.
[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:23.260]   The first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl,
[02:52:23.260 --> 02:52:24.780]   not about anything else.
[02:52:24.780 --> 02:52:25.620]   - That's fascinating.
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:27.500]   I mean, for people who might not know,
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.780]   Chernobyl is located in Ukraine.
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:31.620]   It would be, it's a fascinating view
[02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:34.700]   that Chernobyl might be one of the critical
[02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:36.020]   sort of threshold catalysts
[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:37.860]   for the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:39.500]   That's very interesting.
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:41.680]   Well, just as a small aside,
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:45.940]   I guess this is a good moment to give some love
[02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:47.340]   to the HBO series.
[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:50.860]   It made me, even though it's British accents and so on,
[02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:52.840]   it made me realize that some of these stories
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:55.660]   in Eastern Europe could be told very effectively
[02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:58.820]   through film, through series.
[02:52:58.820 --> 02:53:03.280]   It was quite a, I mean, it was so incredibly well done.
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:07.200]   And maybe I can ask you, historically speaking,
[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:08.140]   were you impressed?
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:12.120]   - I was, I was.
[02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:17.120]   And I think that the miniseries are very truthful
[02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:26.300]   on a number of levels and very untruthful on some others.
[02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:32.440]   And they got excellent in very well
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:36.660]   the macro and micro levels.
[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:39.900]   So the macro level is the issue of the big truth.
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:43.740]   And the story there is very much built around
[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:46.300]   the theme that I just discussed now.
[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:48.580]   It's about the cost of lies, right?
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:52.340]   And the Soviet Union lying to the people
[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:56.820]   and that's what the film explores.
[02:53:56.820 --> 02:54:00.260]   So that's, I call it, a big truth about Chernobyl.
[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:05.260]   And they got a lot of minor things
[02:54:05.420 --> 02:54:07.580]   really, really very well.
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:09.900]   Like the curtains on the windows,
[02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:13.540]   like how the houses looked from inside and outside.
[02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:18.220]   I didn't see any post-Soviet film or any Western film
[02:54:18.220 --> 02:54:23.220]   that would be so good at capturing those everyday details.
[02:54:23.220 --> 02:54:28.300]   But then there is a huge gray area in between big truth
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:32.660]   and small truths of the recreating the environment.
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:34.820]   And that's how you get from one to another.
[02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:38.500]   And then you see the KGB officers coming
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.060]   and taking someone out of the meeting and arresting,
[02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:44.140]   which was not necessary.
[02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:47.180]   You see the Soviet boss threatening someone
[02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:50.000]   to throw the person from the helicopter.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.220]   So you get this Hollywood sort of things
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:56.900]   despite the fact that it's HBO or serious.
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:55:01.460]   And they're the best really in terms as a film
[02:55:01.460 --> 02:55:05.460]   in the fourth episode where they completely decided
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:10.460]   just to hell with the reality and let's make a film.
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:14.660]   So they bring Legasov, one of the key characters,
[02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:18.940]   to this court meetings that they bring.
[02:55:18.940 --> 02:55:22.740]   Soviet party boss, Shcherbina, he wasn't there.
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.320]   They create a drama there.
[02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:31.500]   So they got the main thing, the big truth, right?
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:35.860]   And that's why I like this production.
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:40.860]   - Sometimes you have to show what something felt like.
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:44.180]   You have to go bigger than it actually was.
[02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:46.480]   I mean, if you, I don't know,
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:51.480]   if you experience heartbreak and you see a film about it,
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:53.780]   you want there to be explosions.
[02:55:53.780 --> 02:55:58.280]   You want to see this in images, visible, right?
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:03.280]   So, but the question, again, I just mentioned KGB
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:08.380]   marching in and some party leader giving a speech.
[02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:10.800]   They were not given that speech,
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.100]   but the sense was there and it was in the air.
[02:56:14.100 --> 02:56:18.120]   And I, as people of my generation who were there,
[02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:20.060]   knew that and recognized that.
[02:56:20.060 --> 02:56:23.660]   But for new generation, whether they are in Ukraine
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:28.300]   in Russia, in US, in Britain, in Zimbabwe, anywhere,
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:33.300]   yeah, you have to do this little untruths
[02:56:33.300 --> 02:56:37.540]   and introduce them.
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:42.180]   And had a very interesting on air conversation
[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:47.180]   with the author of the script, amazing.
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:54.300]   And I asked him the question of, the film declared really
[02:56:54.300 --> 02:56:57.940]   the importance of the truth, but how do you square that
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:02.940]   with the need in the film to really put it mildly,
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:09.580]   to go beyond the measures of truth,
[02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:12.160]   whatever understanding of that term is.
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:15.300]   - Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying
[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:18.500]   that some of the most dramatic moments in history
[02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:20.260]   are probably quite mundane.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:24.760]   The decisions to begin wars, invasions,
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:29.340]   they're probably something like a Zoom meeting
[02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:33.780]   on a random Tuesday in today's workplace.
[02:57:33.780 --> 02:57:36.820]   So it's not like there's dramatic music playing.
[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:40.160]   These are just human decisions and they command armies
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:41.700]   and they command destruction.
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:46.620]   I personally, because of that, believe in the power
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:49.220]   of individuals to be able to stop wars,
[02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:51.860]   not just start wars, individual leaders.
[02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:54.540]   So let me just ask about nuclear safety,
[02:57:54.540 --> 02:57:56.020]   because there's an interesting point you make.
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:58.880]   You wrote in the book, in "Atoms and Ashes,"
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:00.820]   a global history of nuclear disaster.
[02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:05.820]   So technically nuclear energy is extremely safe.
[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:08.940]   There's a number of people died per energy generated.
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:11.800]   It's much safer than coal and oil, for example,
[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:13.060]   as far as I understand.
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:16.660]   But the case you also make is, you write, quote,
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.700]   "Many of the political, economic, social,
[02:58:18.700 --> 02:58:22.100]   and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past
[02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:25.700]   are still with us today, making the nuclear industry
[02:58:25.700 --> 02:58:27.460]   vulnerable to repeating old mistakes
[02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:31.380]   in new and unexpected ways, and any new accidents
[02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:35.000]   are certain to create new anti-nuclear mobilization."
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:38.260]   And then you continue with, "This makes the nuclear industry
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:42.420]   not only risky to operate, but also impossible to count on
[02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:46.620]   as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem."
[02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:48.380]   So can you explain that perspective?
[02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:51.140]   It's an interesting one.
[02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:53.380]   So speaking to the psychology of when an accident
[02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:56.940]   does happen, it has a dramatic effect.
[02:58:56.940 --> 02:59:01.940]   And also speaking to the fact that accidents can happen
[02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:06.420]   not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant,
[02:59:06.420 --> 02:59:11.420]   but of the underlying structure of government
[02:59:11.980 --> 02:59:14.100]   that oversees it.
[02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:17.360]   - Yes, I wrote a book on Chernobyl,
[02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:20.820]   and then tried to understand Chernobyl better,
[02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:24.820]   but placing it in the context of other disasters
[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:27.560]   as a historian and was looking at the political factors
[02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:29.500]   and social factors and cultural factors,
[02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:34.500]   not the physics or engineering part of the story.
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:41.500]   And the factors that are still with us
[02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:45.540]   are the, like it was the case in Chernobyl,
[02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:47.220]   the authoritarian regimes, right?
[02:59:47.220 --> 02:59:50.700]   And high centralization of the decision-making.
[02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:55.700]   And desire to cut corners and also the issues
[02:59:55.700 --> 03:00:00.820]   associated with secrecy, so that is with us.
[03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:05.820]   If you look at where the future of the nuclear industry
[03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:11.660]   is now at this point, it's the regimes and parts
[03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:13.940]   in the Middle East.
[03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:16.500]   That's a big new frontier.
[03:00:16.500 --> 03:00:18.860]   The countries that are not particularly known
[03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:22.020]   for the history of democratic existence,
[03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:27.540]   where we also have the situation that we had
[03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:32.540]   at Three Mile Island, that we had at Chernobyl,
[03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:37.660]   this is the first generation nuclear engineers, right?
[03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:42.660]   So people where the country doesn't have a lot
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:45.540]   of experience in generations after generations
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:48.980]   working in that particular industry, where it's all new,
[03:00:48.980 --> 03:00:53.600]   that is certain additional risk.
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:57.460]   And what we got now is this current war,
[03:00:57.460 --> 03:01:02.160]   is something that, not that people completely didn't expect,
[03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:03.780]   but didn't happen in the past.
[03:01:03.780 --> 03:01:07.680]   You see the war coming to the nuclear sites.
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:10.520]   Chernobyl was taken over by the Russian Army,
[03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:15.500]   or National Guard rather, on the first day of the invasion.
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:18.860]   Then there was Zaporizhya, the largest nuclear power plant
[03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:22.660]   in Europe, where the battle was waged on the territory
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:27.660]   of the nuclear power plant, the missiles being fired,
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:32.900]   buildings catching fire, and the situation
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:38.120]   that brought the Fukushima disaster
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:40.800]   was there at Zaporizhya more than once.
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:44.760]   And Fukushima came because the reactors were shut down
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:49.520]   as they are at Zaporizhya, but they still needed electricity
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.480]   to bring water and to cool them down.
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:55.260]   And in Fukushima case, it was the tsunami
[03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:57.400]   that cut off the supply of electricity.
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:02:00.000]   In the case of Zaporizhya, there was the warfare
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.780]   that was happening in the area around Zaporizhya
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:05.960]   that did the same effect.
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:10.500]   So we have 440 reactors in the world today, plus/minus.
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:14.960]   None of them was designed to withstand
[03:02:14.960 --> 03:02:18.320]   the direct missile attack or to function
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:20.660]   in the conditions of the warfare.
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:23.600]   If operators, they're human, they make mistakes,
[03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:26.600]   like they did at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl,
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:30.360]   but think also if the war is happening around them,
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:35.000]   if they're not sure what is happening with their families.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:38.200]   If they don't know whether they will be next to missile,
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:40.520]   whether they'll hit their room,
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:46.560]   whether the control room or not, that multiplies also.
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:51.560]   So we are in a situation where we are not done yet
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.400]   with the nuclear accidents.
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:58.120]   You, each time, it's not like we don't pay attention
[03:02:58.120 --> 03:03:01.920]   or we don't learn, smart people work on that.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:04.880]   And after every accident, try to figure the way
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:09.880]   how not to step into the same trap.
[03:03:09.880 --> 03:03:15.840]   But next accident would actually expose
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:18.340]   a new vulnerability.
[03:03:18.340 --> 03:03:21.480]   You deal with Chernobyl and then tsunami comes.
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:24.520]   You deal with tsunami and then war comes.
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:28.500]   And we really, in that sense,
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:32.040]   we have sometimes wild imagination,
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:34.240]   but sometimes it's difficult to imagine
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:35.560]   what can happen next.
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:38.960]   So we are not done, there will be nuclear accidents,
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:41.260]   unfortunately, in the future.
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:46.260]   And that makes nuclear energy so problematic
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:52.040]   when you count on it to fight climate change.
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:53.600]   I'll explain why.
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:57.800]   You gave the figures how many people die from burning coal,
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:01.600]   from how many people die from radiation.
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:05.980]   And it's a good argument.
[03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:07.520]   Some people would question them
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:10.000]   because it's also the issue of not just dying,
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:15.000]   but impact of radiation on cancer, on our health,
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.040]   which is not completely understood yet.
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:19.560]   So it's still, there is a lot of question marks.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:23.080]   But let's assume what you are saying, that's the figures.
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:24.340]   That's how it is.
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:30.420]   But we as people, we, for whatever reason,
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:32.040]   are not afraid of coal,
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:35.600]   but we are very much afraid of radiation.
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:37.120]   It's invisible.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:41.080]   It's COVID, it's everywhere.
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:42.480]   And you can't see it.
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:45.760]   And then you start having issues.
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:50.000]   And then you have stomach problems.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:55.000]   And during the COVID, the governments closed the borders.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:01.000]   Maybe a good idea, maybe not so good ideas.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:04.000]   Isolation, so that was the way.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:09.440]   Governments started to fight for access to Pfizer,
[03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:14.440]   to Moderna, to Sputnik, to whatever it is, to vaccine.
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:19.240]   So now back to the radiation.
[03:05:19.240 --> 03:05:23.120]   What is happening once Chernobyl happens?
[03:05:23.120 --> 03:05:27.360]   That's the highest point in the development
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:28.880]   of nuclear industry so far,
[03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:33.640]   in terms of how many new reactors were commissioned
[03:05:33.640 --> 03:05:35.640]   or the licenses were issued.
[03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:42.480]   The next reactor after Three Mile Island in the US
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.920]   go ahead was given, it seems to me, 10 years ago
[03:05:46.920 --> 03:05:48.240]   or something like that.
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:51.360]   The Fukushima happens, the reaction is in China to that
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:53.600]   as well, they're very much concerned.
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:56.000]   So there is a saying in the field,
[03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:59.780]   Chernobyl anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere.
[03:05:59.780 --> 03:06:04.040]   After Fukushima, Germany decides to go nuclear free
[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:08.520]   and gets there at the expense of burning coal.
[03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:10.520]   So that's how we react.
[03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:15.520]   And each major accident, that means global freeze
[03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:20.240]   on the nuclear reactor production
[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:22.280]   for at least another 10 years.
[03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:26.240]   So that's what I mean that nuclear industry is,
[03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:31.160]   not just in terms of technology,
[03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:34.760]   not just in terms of radiation, impact on health,
[03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:38.720]   but also politically a very, very unreliable option.
[03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:43.320]   And to you, you suspect that that's an irreparable aspect
[03:06:43.320 --> 03:06:45.880]   of human nature and the human mind,
[03:06:45.880 --> 03:06:49.520]   that there are certain things that just create a panic,
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:51.160]   invisible threats of this kind,
[03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.860]   whether it's a virus or radiation.
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:57.240]   There's something about the mind,
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:07:02.240]   if I get a stomachache in the United States after Fukushima,
[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:04.600]   I think it's probably radiation,
[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:08.360]   this irrational type of thinking.
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:10.880]   - And that's not possible to repair?
[03:07:10.880 --> 03:07:14.580]   - I think we can be trained, right?
[03:07:14.580 --> 03:07:16.520]   We can be trained. - Pretty smart, aren't we?
[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:17.360]   Education.
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:22.360]   - But generally, we are afraid of things that we see,
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:26.200]   but even more, we are afraid of things that we don't see.
[03:07:26.200 --> 03:07:27.760]   And radiation is one of those.
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:30.160]   - Let's zoom out on the world.
[03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:31.920]   We talked about the war in Ukraine.
[03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:36.500]   How does the war in Ukraine change the world order?
[03:07:36.500 --> 03:07:39.760]   Let me just look at everything that's going on.
[03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:40.980]   Zoom out a bit.
[03:07:40.980 --> 03:07:45.980]   China, the Israel-Gaza war, the Middle East,
[03:07:45.980 --> 03:07:52.500]   India, what is interesting to you,
[03:07:52.500 --> 03:07:56.380]   important to think about in the coming years and decades?
[03:07:56.380 --> 03:07:59.620]   - As a historian, and I'm trained that way,
[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:05.200]   I have a feeling of deja vu.
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:10.200]   I see the Cold War is coming back in many of its features.
[03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:17.300]   And the war started, and we discussed that,
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:22.320]   in 2014, at least in my interpretation,
[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:27.320]   with Russia trying to really reestablish its control
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:31.180]   over the post-Soviet space,
[03:08:31.180 --> 03:08:35.040]   and Ukraine was crucial for that project.
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:38.560]   And the more globally Russian vision since 1990s
[03:08:38.560 --> 03:08:43.560]   was that they didn't like the American monopolar world.
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:49.620]   They knew and realized that they couldn't go back
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:54.620]   to the bipolar world of the Cold War era.
[03:08:54.620 --> 03:08:58.440]   So the vision was multipolar world,
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:02.680]   in which, again, it wasn't just academic exercise,
[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:04.800]   it was a political exercise in which Russia
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.200]   would be one of the centers, one of the poles,
[03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:11.280]   on par with China, on par with European Union,
[03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:13.060]   on par with the United States.
[03:09:13.060 --> 03:09:17.120]   That's very broadly speaking the context
[03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:21.580]   in which the war starts in 2014.
[03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:22.900]   Where we are now?
[03:09:22.900 --> 03:09:27.120]   Well, we are now in Russia,
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:30.220]   certainly trying to regain its military strength,
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:34.880]   but no one actually believes that Russia
[03:09:34.880 --> 03:09:39.540]   is the sort of a superpower it was imagined before 2022.
[03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:46.280]   We see, certainly, Russia finding the way
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:49.720]   to deal with the sanctions,
[03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:54.720]   but we don't see, certainly, Russia as an economic power
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:58.900]   with any sort of a future.
[03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:03.560]   So it is not an implosion of the Russian military,
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:05.140]   economic, and political power,
[03:10:05.140 --> 03:10:08.480]   but it's significantly, actually, it is diminished.
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:13.480]   So today, very difficult to imagine the Russia emerging
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:18.000]   as another pole of the multipolar world.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.680]   Not impossible, but the war certainly made
[03:10:20.680 --> 03:10:25.220]   that very problematic and much more difficult.
[03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:29.020]   On the other hand, what the war did,
[03:10:29.020 --> 03:10:34.020]   it basically awakened the West, the Old West,
[03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:39.360]   United States and Western Europe, transatlantic alliance.
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:45.620]   On the top of that, there are East European countries
[03:10:45.620 --> 03:10:49.260]   that are even much stronger proponents
[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:53.060]   of assistance for Ukraine than is Germany
[03:10:53.060 --> 03:10:56.600]   or the United States of America.
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:00.100]   So it is the replay of the Cold War story,
[03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:02.660]   The Return of the West, that one of the chapters
[03:11:02.660 --> 03:11:06.480]   in my book, The Russo-Ukrainian War, is called that way.
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:09.780]   We also can see the elements of the rebuilding
[03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:14.040]   of the Beijing-Moscow alliance of the 1950s,
[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:17.120]   which was a very important part of the Cold War.
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:19.820]   It was extremely important part of the Korean War
[03:11:19.820 --> 03:11:24.820]   that in many ways launched also the Cold War globally.
[03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:28.360]   So I see a lot of parallels of going back
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:33.360]   to the time of the Cold War and the bipolar world
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:35.880]   that emerges, it's not anymore the world focused
[03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:39.420]   on Washington and Moscow, it's more like world focused
[03:11:39.420 --> 03:11:41.820]   on Washington and Beijing.
[03:11:41.820 --> 03:11:44.380]   And then there are countries in between.
[03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:48.580]   There are countries in between that join one block
[03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:50.340]   or another block that is emerging
[03:11:50.340 --> 03:11:53.260]   that is not fully formed.
[03:11:53.260 --> 03:11:58.260]   This is, in my opinion, makes the task of us historians
[03:11:58.260 --> 03:12:03.900]   to really go back to the Cold War and look
[03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:08.900]   and look through new perspective on the history
[03:12:08.900 --> 03:12:10.460]   of that conflict because there is a lot
[03:12:10.460 --> 03:12:12.400]   of things that we can learn.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:18.540]   - So in some ways, history does repeat itself here.
[03:12:18.740 --> 03:12:23.740]   So now it's a Cold War with China and the United States.
[03:12:23.740 --> 03:12:26.980]   What's a hopeful trajectory for the 21st century
[03:12:26.980 --> 03:12:27.900]   for the rest of it?
[03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:32.960]   - The hopeful trajectory is really trying
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:41.540]   to be as wise and as lucky as our predecessors
[03:12:41.540 --> 03:12:47.980]   during the Cold War, because the dominant discourse
[03:12:47.980 --> 03:12:51.300]   so far about the Cold War was, what a horrible thing
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:53.500]   that Cold War was.
[03:12:53.500 --> 03:12:54.660]   What did we do wrong?
[03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:57.240]   How did we end up in the Cold War?
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:02.800]   And I think, especially today, this is a wrong question
[03:13:02.800 --> 03:13:07.800]   to ask, the right question to ask is, how did it happen?
[03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:14.260]   What did we do so right that for now more than 70 years,
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:19.180]   we don't have a World War?
[03:13:19.180 --> 03:13:22.180]   How come that after World War I, World War II
[03:13:22.180 --> 03:13:24.740]   came within 20 years?
[03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:29.740]   How come that what helped us to keep the world
[03:13:29.740 --> 03:13:34.620]   on the brink but still away from the global war
[03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:36.980]   for such a long period of time?
[03:13:36.980 --> 03:13:40.740]   How to keep the Cold War cold?
[03:13:40.740 --> 03:13:43.980]   That's the biggest lesson that the history
[03:13:43.980 --> 03:13:45.260]   of the Cold War can give us.
[03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:49.100]   And I don't think we ask the question quite often enough,
[03:13:49.100 --> 03:13:50.840]   ask the question that way.
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:52.560]   And if you don't ask right questions,
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:53.900]   we don't get right answers.
[03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:56.920]   - Yeah, you've written a book, a great book
[03:13:56.920 --> 03:14:01.920]   on the Cuban Missile Crisis, and we came very close,
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:07.180]   not to just another World War, but to a nuclear war
[03:14:07.180 --> 03:14:13.060]   and the destruction of human civilization as we know it.
[03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:18.300]   So I guess it's a good question to ask,
[03:14:18.300 --> 03:14:21.460]   what do we do so right?
[03:14:21.460 --> 03:14:24.180]   And maybe one of the answers could be
[03:14:24.180 --> 03:14:25.840]   that we just got lucky.
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:30.420]   And the question is, how do we keep getting lucky?
[03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:35.620]   - Luck is clearly one of the factors
[03:14:35.620 --> 03:14:40.260]   in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:44.100]   Because what happened then, there is one of the lessons,
[03:14:44.100 --> 03:14:49.100]   is that eventually the commanders at the top,
[03:14:49.100 --> 03:14:52.060]   they believe that they have all the cards.
[03:14:52.060 --> 03:14:54.300]   They negotiate with each other.
[03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:58.300]   They try to see who blinks first
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:01.820]   in the game of nuclear brinkmanship.
[03:15:01.820 --> 03:15:06.820]   The trick is that they don't control fully people
[03:15:06.820 --> 03:15:09.280]   on the ground.
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:13.220]   The most dangerous moment, or one of the most dangerous
[03:15:13.220 --> 03:15:17.960]   moment of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the Soviet missile
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:22.880]   shooting down the American airplane, killing the pilots.
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:24.320]   An act of war, right?
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:26.980]   So technically we're already in war.
[03:15:26.980 --> 03:15:33.460]   And the order to shoot the missile was given
[03:15:33.460 --> 03:15:36.600]   with Moscow having no clue what was going on the ground.
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:39.200]   Moscow never gave approval for that.
[03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:43.840]   And again, I described that in book many times
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:47.040]   about Kennedy bringing back his wisdom
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:48.660]   from World War II years.
[03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:52.840]   There always will be SOB who didn't get the order
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:56.920]   or miss things and that was happening
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:15:59.000]   on the American side as well.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:02.540]   So people who believe that they're in control
[03:16:02.540 --> 03:16:04.000]   really are not in control.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:09.000]   And that can escalate very often against their issues.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:12.440]   So that is one lesson.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:17.140]   But going back to why we're still here
[03:16:17.140 --> 03:16:22.140]   and why the world didn't end up in 1962
[03:16:22.140 --> 03:16:26.880]   is that the leadership, and I come to the issue
[03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:30.240]   that you strongly believe in, that people,
[03:16:30.240 --> 03:16:32.900]   personalities matter, leaders matter.
[03:16:33.740 --> 03:16:37.740]   They were very different, right?
[03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:43.060]   Age, education, political careers,
[03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:45.740]   understanding what politics are, and so on and so forth.
[03:16:45.740 --> 03:16:47.040]   - You mean Khrushchev?
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:49.540]   - Khrushchev and Kennedy, yes.
[03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:51.180]   But they had one thing in common,
[03:16:51.180 --> 03:16:55.700]   that in one way they belong to the same generation.
[03:16:55.700 --> 03:17:00.580]   That was generation of the bikini atoll.
[03:17:00.580 --> 03:17:04.220]   That was the generation of the hydrogen bomb.
[03:17:04.220 --> 03:17:07.900]   The bomb that, unlike the atomic bomb,
[03:17:07.900 --> 03:17:09.980]   they knew could destroy the world.
[03:17:09.980 --> 03:17:12.200]   And they were scared.
[03:17:12.200 --> 03:17:16.740]   They were scared of the nuclear weapons.
[03:17:16.740 --> 03:17:21.420]   And they tried to do whatever they could,
[03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:23.620]   pushing against their advisors
[03:17:23.620 --> 03:17:28.620]   or trying to deal with their anxieties,
[03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:32.660]   or with their anxieties, the first is true for Kennedy,
[03:17:32.660 --> 03:17:36.580]   the later maybe for Khrushchev,
[03:17:36.580 --> 03:17:41.160]   to make sure that the war between the United States
[03:17:41.160 --> 03:17:45.060]   and the Soviet Union doesn't start
[03:17:45.060 --> 03:17:50.060]   because they knew that that war would be a nuclear war.
[03:17:50.060 --> 03:17:55.380]   So we have a very, very paradoxical sort of situation.
[03:17:56.460 --> 03:17:59.340]   The crisis occurred because of the nuclear weapons,
[03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:02.040]   because Khrushchev put them on Cuba.
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:04.740]   But the crisis was resolved and we didn't end
[03:18:04.740 --> 03:18:07.640]   in the Third World War because of the nuclear weapons,
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:12.640]   because people, litters, were afraid of them.
[03:18:12.640 --> 03:18:16.780]   And that's where I want to put emphasis.
[03:18:16.780 --> 03:18:20.420]   It's not that the nuclear weapons created crisis
[03:18:20.420 --> 03:18:24.220]   or solved the crisis, it's basically our perception of them.
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:29.220]   And we are now in the age after the Cold War era,
[03:18:29.220 --> 03:18:31.620]   with the new generation of voters,
[03:18:31.620 --> 03:18:34.320]   with the new generation of politicians,
[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:37.740]   we don't belong to the generation of bikini at all.
[03:18:37.740 --> 03:18:39.340]   We maybe know what bikini is,
[03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:43.420]   but we think that this is something else.
[03:18:43.420 --> 03:18:46.540]   And it's very important.
[03:18:46.540 --> 03:18:49.460]   - It's so fascinating how that fades into memory,
[03:18:49.460 --> 03:18:52.860]   that the power and the respect and fear
[03:18:52.860 --> 03:18:55.940]   of the power of nuclear weapons just fades into memory.
[03:18:55.940 --> 03:18:59.040]   And that we may very well make the same mistakes again.
[03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:00.040]   - Yes, we can.
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:03.460]   - Another leader said that, I believe.
[03:19:03.460 --> 03:19:06.220]   But a totally different topic.
[03:19:06.220 --> 03:19:10.140]   Well, like you said, I'm also glad that we're here.
[03:19:10.140 --> 03:19:14.020]   As a civilization, that we still seem to be going on.
[03:19:14.020 --> 03:19:15.500]   There's several billion of us.
[03:19:15.500 --> 03:19:17.820]   And I'm also glad that the two of us are here.
[03:19:17.820 --> 03:19:20.780]   I've read a lot of your books, I've been recommending it.
[03:19:20.780 --> 03:19:22.980]   Please keep writing, thank you for talking today.
[03:19:22.980 --> 03:19:23.940]   This is an honor.
[03:19:23.940 --> 03:19:24.940]   - Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:19:24.940 --> 03:19:26.220]   It was a pleasure.
[03:19:26.220 --> 03:19:28.820]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:19:28.820 --> 03:19:30.200]   with Serhi Plohi.
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:31.460]   To support this podcast,
[03:19:31.460 --> 03:19:34.100]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:19:34.100 --> 03:19:36.180]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:19:36.180 --> 03:19:37.780]   from Ernest Hemingway.
[03:19:37.780 --> 03:19:43.200]   Never think that war, no matter how necessary,
[03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:46.860]   nor how justified, is not a crime.
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:50.860]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:19:50.860 --> 03:19:53.020]   (silence)
[03:19:53.020 --> 03:19:55.180]   (silence)
[03:19:55.180 --> 03:20:13.160]   [ Silence ]
