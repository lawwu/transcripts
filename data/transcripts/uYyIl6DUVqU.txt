[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   A couple of emails have come in asking whether or not it's wrong for a
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880]   Christian to smoke marijuana, and assuming that for them it's legal either
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.700]   for medical use or because of legislation in the state that they live
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.000]   in, how would you answer them, Pastor John? Well, I don't know a lot about
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040]   marijuana. I'm not an expert on it. I've read a little, listened to some comments
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.240]   about it in the news and so on. So here's the way I approach it as a novice, and
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.680]   yet I think we can have some solid biblical guidance here. Marijuana is
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.840]   ordinarily thought of, and I think ordinarily used, as a mood-altering,
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.200]   mind-altering drug that creates a kind of a pleasant euphoria. It's not
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.800]   generally thought of as making one more attentive to reality, but more oblivious
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.800]   of reality. And in that sense, if you try to compare it with caffeine, say, and I
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.760]   can imagine somebody saying, "Well, what's wrong? They're both mood-altering drugs.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.280]   You drink your coffee and they're going to alter your mood, and I do my marijuana
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.440]   to alter my mood, and so they're the same." Well, not exactly, because one of the
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.360]   effects of coffee is that it makes you more alert to reality, and if it didn't, I
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.520]   think we should run away from it. In fact, I think it is possible to sin with
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.200]   caffeine, but there's a really significant difference here in that the
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.000]   mind is being sharpened, hopefully, not made more blunt or more out of
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.880]   touch with reality. So I don't think marijuana is generally thought of as an
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.640]   empowering drug that enables you to be a more competent dad, a more
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   competent mother, a more competent employee, a more competent citizen. It's
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.120]   rather a recreational escape, and from the little I've read, over time becomes a
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.640]   destructive force in the brain. It has lasting negative effects on the mind's
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.400]   ability to do what God created it to do. And so if all that's true, then the
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.920]   principles from the Bible that I think would lead a Christian away from the
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.480]   recreational use of marijuana would be, one, that the body is the temple of
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.280]   the Holy Spirit. That simple teaching had a huge effect on me as a kid. If I was
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.240]   raising kids again today, I'd say that about smoking, I'd say it about
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.440]   excessive use of alcohol, I'd say it about marijuana, or lots of other things.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.200]   I'd say, "Your body is sacred. God is for your body. Your body is for the Lord."
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.400]   1 Corinthians 6, 13. Keep your mind clear and able to think, because Paul said, "Be
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.280]   babes in evil, but in your thinking be mature," that is, be sharp, be on top of it.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.800]   And the root of that is that God gave us minds to know Him, and He gave us hearts
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.640]   to love Him. And so anything we do that would numb our mind or dull our mind or
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.240]   distract our mind away from the growing capacities to know Him better and love
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.760]   Him more, a Christian is going to want to want to turn away from. And that is
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.660]   the way the Bible talks about drunkenness. And I think marijuana is in
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.680]   that same category. It says, "In the end it bites like a serpent, it stings like an
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.440]   adder, your eyes will see strange things, and your heart will utter perverse things."
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   In other words, it leads away from the kind of sober self-control and use of
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.200]   the mind for the glory of God. But, you know, having said that, namely
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.640]   that I think a Christian is going to turn away from these kinds of destructive
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.320]   mood-altering drugs and move toward lucid, clear thinking for the glory of
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   God, I would not oppose a kind of medical use of marijuana that is controlled by
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.400]   appropriate physician oversight and prescriptions. We have lots of drugs, it
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.160]   seems to me, that are sold by prescription, which if they were abused
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.640]   would be as destructive or even more destructive than marijuana. And I had a
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.160]   friend who shared with me very soberly one time that he had a son who had a
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.840]   long-standing old ankle injury, and he said, "I know from his experience that the
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   only relief he can get is with a slight use of marijuana." So if there were a way
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   to use marijuana the way we use aspirin or the way we use an antibiotic with
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.240]   careful oversight, in principle I wouldn't oppose that.
