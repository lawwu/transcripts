[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.440]   - Good Monday morning everyone,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.000]   and thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Well, is it sinful to fall short of excellence in our work?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.060]   This is a great question, relevant for businessmen,
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.020]   for stay-at-home wives, for volunteers,
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.060]   for students, for all of us.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.280]   And the question comes to us from a listener named Dylan.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.800]   Here's what he asks.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.640]   Pastor Jen, hello to you,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.600]   and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.000]   In Colossians 3, verses 22 to 24,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.720]   Paul exhorts his readers to work heartily
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.480]   as for the Lord and not for men.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.240]   Does this mean that any work not done in excellence is sin?
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   How do we apply God's view of work to cleaning our house,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.680]   writing a paper for school, or working a nine to five job?
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440]   I've been feeling guilty about the way
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320]   I handle these things for months now,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.200]   and I'm not sure if I'm being self-righteous
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.080]   or if I'm being disobedient to the Lord.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   Is Paul describing a type of excellence in all that we do?
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.280]   Let me begin with an illustration from my ministry
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.340]   from about 30 years ago.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.840]   We were wrestling at the time in our church
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.560]   with how to think about expectations of excellence
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.120]   in music, in worship services.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.960]   And there was one group that stressed technical excellence
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.600]   and quoted 2 Samuel 24, 24,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.440]   "I will not offer anything to the Lord my God
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.920]   that cost me nothing."
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.880]   Which being applied in our situation meant,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.640]   "I will not offer God any music in our worship services
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.240]   that has not cost me an extraordinary effort of practice
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.120]   so as to make it technically excellent, even flawless."
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.240]   Then there was another group,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.220]   or maybe I should say it was me.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.120]   (both laughing)
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.700]   And my pushback, gentle pushback,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.760]   I appreciated that kind of commitment to excellence.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.840]   However, my gentle pushback to this emphasis
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.760]   was in the Christian church,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   God not only cares about whether we are excellent musicians,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.600]   but also cares about whether we are excellent forgivers.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.680]   That's the way I stated it.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.440]   Whether we are excellent in patience,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.480]   excellent in long suffering.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.020]   For example, patience and forgiveness,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.660]   if someone's musical effort was not flawless.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.560]   In other words, when it comes to excellence
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.720]   in the Christian life,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   we dare not ever limit it to the way a person does a skill
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.960]   or the way a person does a craft.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.920]   But we must always take into account excellence in attitudes,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.320]   excellence in emotions, excellent in relationships.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.600]   God has lots more to say in his word
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.660]   about whether we are angry in our attitude
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.660]   than he does about whether we're competent in our skill.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.500]   The way we finally worked this out among our people
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   and among our leaders was to use the phrase as our goal,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.860]   undistracting excellence.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.380]   In other words, there is something bigger and deeper
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.620]   and more important going on in this service
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.740]   than the technical quality of music.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.500]   Not unimportant, it's just not most important.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   The aim here is to know God, meet God, love God,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.300]   treasure God, trust God, enjoy God.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.160]   Those are all acts of the heart and mind.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.740]   Everything else is subservient to that in this service,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.860]   helping people get to that,
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.020]   including the excellence of our performances,
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.580]   whether it's music or sound system or lighting or heating
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.420]   or air conditioning or preaching
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.500]   or the clothing that we wear.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.420]   Everything is to remove obstacles, undistracting,
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.420]   remove obstacles and to serve knowing God,
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.780]   meeting God, loving God, treasuring God,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.620]   trusting God, enjoying God.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.620]   We captured that goal by putting the adjective undistracting
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.900]   in front of the word excellence.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   It implied that not only might shoddy work distract
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.180]   from meeting God, the person continually makes mistakes.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.440]   Everybody's going to be embarrassed,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.020]   they're going to be distracted, that's not going to work.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   But also excessive finesse might distract
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.500]   from the spiritual reality of encountering God.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.180]   And I'm thinking of this in preaching, not just music.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.180]   I mean, a sermon can be so shoddy in its order and clarity
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.620]   that it doesn't help.
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.180]   And it can be so rhetorically refined
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.420]   that it distracts and doesn't help.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.420]   So the criterion ceased to be a kind of abstract view
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.120]   of technical excellence and became a spiritual goal
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.940]   of removing obstacles from people's seeing
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.280]   and savoring Christ.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   Now, Dylan is asking about Colossians 3, 22 to 24
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.240]   and how it calls us to excellence.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.480]   Here's the text.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.760]   Bond servants, obey in everything those
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.480]   who are your earthly masters,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.600]   not by way of eye service as people pleasers,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.960]   Whatever you do, work heartily.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   It's literally ekpsukes, from the soul.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   Work from the soul as for the Lord and not for men,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.600]   knowing that from the Lord,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.440]   you will receive the inheritance as your reward.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.700]   You are serving the Lord Christ.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.040]   What a great text.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   I think Dylan is right to draw principles
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.720]   for all of us from these verses,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.760]   even though they are directed to slaves and masters.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.520]   And I say that because verse 17,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.280]   just above this paragraph, says,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.000]   whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.880]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.920]   And I think Paul is simply applying that global principle
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.540]   for all of us to the slave master relationship
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.120]   so that all of us can learn from his application.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.720]   And I would point to three things that he says.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   One, don't just try to be outwardly pleasing to people
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.360]   while your heart doesn't care about the people
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.340]   and doesn't care really about what quality of work you do,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.840]   as long as they think it's good.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.960]   It's eye service, that's man pleasing.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.680]   In other words, don't be a hypocrite.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.200]   If you're going to give the impression outwardly
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   to your boss or your teacher or your spouse or your friend
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.640]   that you are doing something to please them,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.460]   then do something really to please them.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.400]   Don't be a hypocrite.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Don't be a double tongued or a double behavior person
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.120]   who outwardly wants them to have a sense
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.400]   of being pleased with their eyes.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560]   And deep down, you haven't done good work at all.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   And you're concealing it from them.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.200]   That would significantly affect the quality of work you do
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.480]   if you had that kind of mindset.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.240]   And Paul says, don't have it.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   Second, whatever job you have and whomever it is
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.120]   that you are working for as a Christian,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.920]   always think of Jesus Christ as the one
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.560]   to whom you will give an account
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.640]   for the quality of your work
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.200]   and the quality of your attitudes in the work.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.860]   So verse 24 says, you are serving the Lord Christ,
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.120]   meaning whoever else you're serving,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.040]   you are really serving Christ in serving them.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   So whatever quality of attitude and quality of work
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.100]   you would do if Christ were your immediate supervisor,
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.780]   do that kind of work with that kind of attitude.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.780]   And third, Paul says, keep in mind that your reward
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.220]   for the good you do will come from the Lord,
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.380]   even if it doesn't come from man.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.380]   So clearly, Paul is implying, one,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.780]   knowing that we shouldn't be hypocrites
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.700]   or deceitful men pleasers,
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.900]   and knowing that ultimately our supervisor
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.900]   for this homework or housework or job work
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.900]   is the Lord Jesus himself.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   And three, knowing that our reward comes from him,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.740]   not primarily from the teachers or spouses or bosses,
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.420]   all of that will exert an influence
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.740]   on the quality of work we do
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.520]   and the good attitudes with which we do it.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.800]   And then Dylan asks, does this mean
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.600]   that any work not done in excellence is sin?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.300]   And if that question is to be answered with precision,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   I would say the answer is no, not always.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.920]   It's not always sin.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.160]   It's not that simple.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   For example, if you decide to paint your own bedroom
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.920]   rather than hire a professional painter,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.880]   because you think God wants you to give the several hundred
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.920]   dollars you might pay the painter
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.060]   to some missionary friend,
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.940]   and yet you're not a very skilled painter,
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.860]   how will God look upon the exactness of the line
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.960]   between the beige wall and the white ceiling
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.520]   where they meet each other up in the corner?
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.640]   I'm speaking from experience here.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.160]   A skilled painter gets a little bead,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.080]   I've seen him do this,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.000]   gets a little bead of paint on the end of his brush
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.560]   and he drags it, this perfect little bead,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   he drags it along that line with such amazing precision
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.960]   that the line between the edge,
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.040]   between the beige wall and the white ceiling is perfect.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.720]   Now my lines, my lines between the beige wall
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.220]   and the white ceiling are wavy.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.200]   (both laughing)
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.800]   - If you like waves.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.960]   - Here's my answer.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   God will not view my wavy edges as sin.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.460]   He won't, even though they are not technically excellent,
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.560]   like a painter could make them.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.520]   Bigger things are at stake, in other words.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.120]   But if I advertise myself as a painter
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.600]   with my present skill and I go into somebody else's bedroom
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.800]   and I paint their wall with wavy edges
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   of beige on the wall and white on the ceiling
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.160]   with a wavy line in between,
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.760]   hoping they won't see it and how shoddy it is
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.760]   compared to what a real painter could do,
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.880]   that will be sin.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.520]   And the same thing applies to so many situations.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   It's not sin to make a B in algebra class
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.320]   instead of an A, that's not.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.920]   If you work hard, do your best.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   It's not sin to make five sales this week instead of 10
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.960]   if you're doing your best.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.320]   And I would define your best like this.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.960]   That's the last thing I'd say, I think.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   Your best is defined as a fallible effort
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.640]   to take into account all relevant factors like sleep.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.240]   I need sleep.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   And health and family and my age and energy and gifting
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   and other relationships that need to be tended to.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.400]   And then when all is said and done,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   you entrust yourself to the grace of Christ
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   who died for you so that you could enjoy
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.220]   his excellent forgiveness.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.320]   - Very good, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.560]   This episode in Colossians 3 and pursuing excellence
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.520]   in our work reminds me of two related episodes
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   in the podcast archive.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.840]   You can check those out.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.000]   Check out "How to Fight Laziness," that's ABJ 79,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   and "How Do I Glorify God in My Job?"
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.560]   That's ABJ 1121.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   Both are relevant to this episode.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.280]   Check them out, ABJ 79 and 1121.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.360]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.720]   You can ask a question of your own.

[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   Well, what is the easiest step of love?
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.600]   What's the easiest way to love others?
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.920]   We're gonna look at it tomorrow,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.200]   and you can do it before you get out of bed
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.480]   in the morning, in fact.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680]   Stay tuned for that.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.520]   I'm your host Tony Reink.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.880]   You will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
