[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   On the hotel side is where I think Citi really shines.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.820]   And that's honestly the reason
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.740]   that I wanted to get into Citi's program
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.320]   was hotels and the Eva Air availability.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.880]   Notably, Citi gets choice hotels,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.660]   which is also part of Amex, also part of Cap One,
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.800]   but you get a one to two ratio
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.680]   instead of on those programs, you get a one to one.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.480]   So twice as many choice points.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.700]   Wells Fargo Rewards similarly has a one to two choice points.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.480]   I'll brush on Wells Fargo in a little bit,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.260]   but the access to some preferred hotels,
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.660]   which are some nice luxury hotels,
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.080]   is interesting.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.540]   There are also a ton of choice hotels.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.600]   They don't have the most luxurious portfolio.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.680]   There are some really nice Radisson Blues,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.260]   Cambria, Ascends, but for the most part,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.960]   I would say compared to other hotel chains,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   the shining star of choice is not hotels
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.540]   if you're looking to stay in really luxury properties.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.620]   But if you are, Citi also has preferred hotels
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.580]   and leading hotels of the world.
