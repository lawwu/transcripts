[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - I'd love to talk about abdominal or rather core work.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.380]   - Sure.
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.340]   - Another thing that I love in the Naked Warrior
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.140]   are the abdominal exercises.
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.900]   I must tell you, after years of doing some crunches
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.200]   here and there and different, you know,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.940]   for whatever this class or that class are trying to,
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.020]   I never really cared about having my abs defined
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.380]   for its own sake.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.540]   One should probably be able to at least contract their abs.
[00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.740]   Okay, it's the level of-
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.020]   - We assess them by punching.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.580]   - Right, right, right, exactly.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.500]   But there's some wonderful exercises in there
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.540]   about learning to brace the entire body
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.540]   and some, dare I say, some rather unorthodox ways
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020]   of assessing stability at the level of the core.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.560]   I'm thinking about the plank where somebody tries
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.660]   to either kick you over or push you over.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.620]   This might sound violent.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.700]   This is not where you start, folks.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.620]   - It's kind and gentle.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.980]   - But I never thought I could do
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.460]   like hanging pikes, for instance.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.020]   And like now pikes are a standard part of my weekly routine.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.660]   I love doing five sets of five of hanging pikes.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.140]   - Great, great.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.080]   - And I will tell anyone that decides to go down this path
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.620]   that when I first tried to do a pike, I failed miserably.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.860]   I tried an L-sit, failed miserably.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.500]   Tried the, you know, hanging from the bar
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.860]   and just getting into a chair position
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.280]   and could just barely hold that.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.060]   The progressions are what matter, right?
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.620]   Slow progression and patience.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.740]   Now five sets of five pikes, trivial for me.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.360]   But when I, I just want to emphasize that when I started,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.060]   I was far, far away from that.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.700]   And it's the progressions in the book that really helped me
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.100]   and I've maintained that pike ability.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.220]   So thank you for that.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.920]   And I say, not to necessarily to highlight what I can do,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.380]   but that to highlight what I do believe most anybody can do.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.420]   If you put the work in.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.540]   - If they put a lot of attention in.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.740]   So midsection training is one of the most misunderstood
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.820]   and messed up areas of physical culture.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.740]   There's a thousand different exercises
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.880]   and people are going to get a variety, this many reps.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.060]   That's not the point.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.480]   The point really is tension and attention.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.500]   So those are the two things.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.780]   And ideally your best first step
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.800]   is really learning abdominal tension
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460]   through something like a Zurcher squat
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.420]   or double kettlebell front squat,
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.220]   where the load distribution is such
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.260]   that it forces reflexive stabilization.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.020]   And you feel, oh, that's what tight abs feel like.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.300]   And getting somebody just weak in a plank, it's hopeless.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.660]   It's absolutely not going to help.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.500]   It's not.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140]   There are ways of building up to it, yes,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.860]   by rolling in the back and so on.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.180]   So, but if you don't have that option,
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.660]   or if you choose not to exercise it,
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.940]   you have to be extremely attentive to the details
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940]   of what's going on within your abdomen.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.020]   So you need to learn things like, for example,
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.340]   you need to learn to contract the pelvic diaphragm,
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.680]   pull your butt up.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.820]   Because you're trying to constrain
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.780]   the intra-abdominal pressure.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.940]   Then you need to learn how to direct attention
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.100]   to the different parts of your abdomen,
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.940]   almost like a bodybuilder, but really not quite,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.580]   more like a gymnast.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.980]   There is this argument about, in the strength world,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.700]   about internal focus, external focus, and cueing.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.460]   And the agreement is in motor learning,
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.420]   well, external focus cueing is so much better
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.620]   than focusing on whatever happens
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.340]   within the individual muscle.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.260]   It may be true in the beginning,
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.860]   and it may be true outside of the strength game,
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.740]   but any top strength athlete that you will meet,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.820]   they have their own internal cues how they do something.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.140]   Later on, they may forget them, it despires them,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.460]   but they know how to, this is how I engage the lat
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.060]   in the bench press.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.180]   George Halbert, bench press world record holder,
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.060]   famously said, "It took him many years
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.720]   "to finally understand how the triceps
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.580]   "is used in the bench press, many years."
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.780]   So there is a lot of internal component,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.100]   and for the abs, very, very much.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.300]   So you have to learn how to very much
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.700]   direct your attention there.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.020]   To get high tension, you have to keep the reps low.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.980]   Like you said, five sets of five, perfect.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.780]   High reps are not necessary.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.860]   You're not gonna burn off fat by doing more reps,
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.660]   you're just gonna irritate your back,
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.500]   that's all you're gonna do, nothing else.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.740]   So you treat your ab training very much
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.380]   like a strength event.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.440]   And if you do that, you're gonna get those results.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.660]   And finally, the final detail is you need to use
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.900]   that intra-abdominal pressure as your friend.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.540]   Because in lifting, like a deadlift or a squat or something,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.820]   the intra-abdominal pressure helps you, it supports you.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.500]   When you're doing abdominal work,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.420]   you work against that intra-abdominal pressure.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.260]   You just create that pressure and contract against it.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.020]   This is something called internal isometrics.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.860]   So it's kind of interesting, it's just a combination
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.100]   of classic strength work with very internalized,
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.700]   kind of almost like a martial arts approach to it.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.340]   Then you need to learn also how to obviously use your abs
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.060]   in the lifts, in lifting.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.100]   And once you do, and this is the beauty,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.340]   you don't really have to train your abs anymore.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.340]   So Franco Colombo, for example, great example,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.900]   in addition to winning, you know, being super strong
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.020]   and winning Mr. Olympia, he won the best abs.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.380]   He didn't train abs.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.820]   He said, he told me, "I hate ab training."
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.980]   He just would stay tight whenever he did his heavy lifts.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.440]   And this is pretty much what happens.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.260]   When you reach a certain level of strength
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.500]   and a certain level of awareness,
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.780]   simply staying tight during your strength work
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.260]   and also employing power breathing, which is very important,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.940]   you're going to be able to get as strong as you need
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.460]   in the abs and get your six pack or whatever,
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.220]   provided, you know, you don't eat the Twinkies.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.540]   So how do you pressurize the...
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.900]   In fact, may I show an abdominal exercise right now
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.420]   that is just sitting at this table
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.200]   that's also going to teach you how,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.460]   teach your audience how to properly pressurize for lifting.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.140]   So normally it's better done standing.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.900]   So, and it's not for people with high blood pressure
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.860]   or heart concerns, you know, check with your doctor
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.580]   if that's the situation.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.620]   So you take a normal breath in your abdomen
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.940]   and you pull up your butt pretty much.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.840]   Like imagine you have to go to the restroom
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   and you're trying to, you can't quite, you know,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.420]   it's far away, you're trying to stop yourself.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.340]   And then you put your tongue between your teeth
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.680]   and you start (inhales and exhales)
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.340]   and you start hissing.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.640]   And you do this in this ratcheting kind of manner.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.380]   So (inhales and exhales)
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.600]   try to keep all the pressure out of your head,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.140]   out of your neck, direct all the pressure,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.140]   all this pressure is just to really staying below.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.440]   And so this type of hissing, (inhales and exhales)
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.400]   you will notice that very rapidly
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.160]   you're going to contract everything around your waist.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.960]   So everything around your waist is going to contract
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   and you're going to strain your abdomen.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.680]   You're also going to start learn how to properly,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.320]   how to properly stabilize yourself under heavy weights.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.640]   The difference between using this technique for lifting
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.360]   and for just training the abs,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.240]   when you're training the abs
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.640]   there's going to be some spinal flexion, not a whole lot.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.840]   You don't want to do a lot of that.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.340]   There's going to be some spinal flexion.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.820]   When you're doing that under a heavy barbell squat,
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.680]   you're maintaining your spine is neutral.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.540]   It's like your body stays a cylinder
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.080]   and you're going to hold your breath pretty much.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.380]   But the idea is the same.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.480]   So it's like, so the Valsalva maneuver,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.080]   one Russian coach called it,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   it's an exhalation that didn't happen, okay?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.920]   Because people don't know how to hold their breath properly.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.960]   They just, and then eyes are bulging out
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   where there's no stability right here.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.200]   So first of all, you got to inhale low.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.680]   And how do you do that?
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.960]   If you watch top lifters, how they do that,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.720]   they will do it through pursed lips.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.520]   You can also do it through the nose,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.600]   but you cannot do through big wide open mouth.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.280]   So I'll show you why.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   So if you, you can, your folks can try it at home.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.240]   So if you put your hand on your stomach
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   and trying to do an abdominal breath,
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.160]   it doesn't go very well.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.000]   Now, for contrast, pinch off one nostril,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.080]   take an abdominal breath,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   or you can do that through pursed lips.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   Try it again.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.720]   So you see-
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.600]   - More resistance.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.440]   - More resistance.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.480]   And again, you're engaging the diaphragm
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.880]   instead of just your thorax right there.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.200]   So you take that breath into your abdomen
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.000]   in like through a small opening through your nose
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.440]   or through your pursed lips, you draw it in right there.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.640]   And then, you know, down below, you pull it up.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.280]   And then after that, it's that exhalation
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.480]   that didn't happen.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.320]   Do you see?
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.160]   - I see.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.240]   So I'm familiar with sort of bracing my abs.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.640]   What I've not done before is the resisting
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.600]   going to the bathroom thing that you mentioned,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   the pulling up of the butt.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.000]   And then, so you're creating compression
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.840]   from the bottom and from the top.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   - And also from all around,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.040]   that happens reflexively as well.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.880]   - I see.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.960]   So that's the position to get in to before, say,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.320]   like a hard Zurcher squat or something like that.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.520]   And if you're doing that for an exercise
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.480]   that's long in duration, you know,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.720]   if you don't wanna be holding your breath too long,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.800]   then we have an expression
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.920]   that comes from one of the karate styles,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   breathing behind the shield.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.160]   So right now I can speak to you,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840]   but I'm still just as tight.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   So you see what you're doing.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.720]   So the way we test it at our,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   the way we teach it at our workshops
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.720]   is you lie on the ground.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   I tell you to tense up.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.000]   Then I'm gonna stand on your stomach.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.800]   I'm gonna have you sing a song.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.360]   And you're gonna have to learn
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.320]   to properly maintain that pressure
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.560]   while still continuing to breathe.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.760]   So you're able to stabilize your spine,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.400]   but you're not going to pass out
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.320]   from maintaining that by holding your breath
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.800]   for a period of time.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.720]   And then finally, what you gotta learn to do
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.440]   is you gotta learn to match the breath with the force.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.800]   So synchronize, synchronize when you're punching,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   when you're throwing, when you're lifting,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.960]   you have to learn how to match that contraction,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   the timing of the abdominal contraction
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.920]   and the pressurization, sometimes exhalation,
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.120]   sometimes just pretending to with the effort.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.720]   Once you learn how to match the breath with the force,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.320]   it's like magic.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.840]   And what people don't realize
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   is not just purely mechanical.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.280]   Mechanically, yes, of course it works.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.760]   You know, Stu explained this so well
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.840]   about the stiffness of the structure,
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   the analogy of the bicycle frame.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.560]   It's the same thing.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.280]   You're getting an expensive bicycle frame
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.680]   when you have strong abs,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.400]   as opposed to the cheap one that rattles and wiggles.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   But there's also something that it's never spoken about
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.640]   in the West for some reason.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   The Soviets studied that decades ago.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.600]   There's something they called the pneumo,
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   mathematic reflex, pneumo is P-N-E-U-M-O, so air.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.040]   So there are barrier receptors,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.160]   receptors for sensors for pressure
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.880]   inside your abdominal cavity and thoracic cavity.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   So whenever these receptors are stimulated,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.600]   what they do is they automatically increase the sensitivity
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.080]   about alpha motor neurons.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.480]   So what it really means to the audience is this.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.720]   If you imagine your brain is the music player
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.920]   and imagine your muscle is a speaker,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.800]   the amount of intra-abdominal pressure
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.440]   is your volume control.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   So by increasing that pressure, you're increasing
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.920]   the strength, but by releasing
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.960]   that intra-abdominal pressure, you relax the muscle.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.080]   So that's why in stretching, as I mentioned before,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.240]   you can't be sitting in a half split and groaning.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.120]   No, you need to release.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.880]   If you release that passive breath,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.160]   again, your muscles are going to relax.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.360]   So controlling your breath is very much,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.800]   as it's known in martial arts,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.480]   it's very much synonymous with controlling your body
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.800]   and your mind very often.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.840]   - Fantastic.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.480]   When one throws a punch,
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   is it true that exhaling is actually providing
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.480]   additional power or?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.320]   - No question about it.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.160]   - Okay.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.120]   - Yeah, it's been measured.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.680]   It's been measured on fighters.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.920]   It's also been measured in lifting as well.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.200]   There was a study that was done in the West even
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.120]   when screaming increases strength significantly.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.840]   And again, this is not just a psychological component.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.040]   I mean, there may be some psychological component to that,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.960]   but again, there's this very distinct increase
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.920]   of strength through that reflex.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.560]   And it's very easy for the listeners to test that,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.240]   get a dynamometer, hand gripper,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   and just test yourself on that.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.960]   And just see, test it out with different breathing patterns
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.600]   and just see what happens.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.080]   And whenever this idiotic practice at some gyms,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.520]   oh, you can't grunt right here.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.320]   And it's just, well, I guess you can be strong here.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   And yeah, of course, if you're doing this on purpose,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.680]   you're walking in with the bros
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.600]   and you're just trying to just to make noise
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.560]   to attract attention, that's wrong.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   But strength is a noisy endeavor.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.840]   So there may be some hissing.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.520]   There may be some grunting.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.800]   It's just absolutely unavoidable.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.640]   And if you're trying to be quiet
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.720]   and if you're trying to be a lady or a gentleman,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.380]   well, maybe it's for somewhere else, not for the gym.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.780]   (upbeat music)
