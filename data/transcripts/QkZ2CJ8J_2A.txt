[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   All right, Sarah says, "How can schools implement a deep work approach to learning?"
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   All right, so let's think elementary, high school level, so like secondary elementary school level,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.160]   at that level of education, can we be doing things to prepare students for cognitive work
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.160]   and in particular deep work type efforts? I think so. I think there's at least three things that we
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.760]   could specifically integrate into curriculums. One is just the mental model, teaching the students
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.280]   the mental model that talks about concentration as a skill that is A, trainable, it's like running,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.520]   the more you train the faster you can do it, and B, incredibly valuable. This is what allows,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.960]   okay great, Andrew Wiles' law of Fermat's last theorem, sure, but it's also what allows your
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   favorite musician or songwriter to do something really innovative with the music or to learn the
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.840]   instrument that they then play in a way that is so impressive, what allows this athlete to be
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.280]   so great, that allows this writer to write this book that you love or that allows this public
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.480]   thinker to really shape the public conversation. You've got to teach them this mental model,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.600]   concentration, especially in today's knowledge style economy, knowledge style economy of
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.520]   ideas as well as actual economic output, concentration, deep thinking, careful thinking,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.280]   it's everything. It's like being good with the sword in ancient Sparta and it's something that
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.360]   has to be trained. Just giving them that model, very important. Two, practice this in the classroom.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now we're going to sit here and do this, it's going to be 20 minutes and then you know what,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.120]   by October we're going to do 30 minute sessions and by November we're going to do 40 minute
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.360]   sessions just working on whatever, these hard visualization problems or math problems. We're
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.800]   going to do writing prompts, you just write, write, write and don't let your concentration
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.440]   wander. But then when it's over, everyone can jump up and run around and get all their wiggles out
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   and then we're going to sit down and do it again. You can actually practice concentration, do
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   interval training on concentration in the classroom. A, this will make them better at concentrating. B,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.520]   it reinforces that aspect of the mental model I referenced that concentration can be trained.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.080]   Let your students see they get better at it. Let them see they get better at it. That's more
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   critical than how good you make them, knowing that they can always get better at it. And then three,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.800]   I would have detailed notes for parents about how homework should go and about this mental model and
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.080]   how homework is an aspect for them to practice sustained and focused concentration at home and
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.000]   how they should set up homework. And it should be these set times they know when it's going to be,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680]   and it should be disconnected and there should be no phone there. And you should say your students
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   will 100%, I will put $1,000 on the table wagering that the first thing your student will say to you
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.920]   is I need the computer, I need internet to do research and there's Google Classroom has my
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   notes in it. Call BS on that. Great. Let's sit down at the computer together and get everything
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   you need and then you can go do the work with it. Don't let them use that. Or here's the other one
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.480]   you will see, and I'll bet a lot of money on this because I've been doing this for a while.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.160]   I need my phone because I have to text my group mates if I have questions.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.080]   So you get detailed notes from teachers to say, call BS.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:39.360]   Homework should be a time for them to practice it. By the way, there is an extra mental health
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.160]   benefit to making work at home, especially for high school age students or junior high
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.200]   age students with pretty intense homework. If you actually work structured without distraction,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.520]   the amount of time it takes to get that work done well cuts by a factor of two or three.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.080]   That's not nothing. If three hours that goes kind of late into the night gets replaced with one hour
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   done right before dinner, it is a much smaller footprint that homework is a much smaller
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   footprint on the student schedule. So yes, I think we should be training deep work.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.560]   There are some ideas off the top of my head.
