[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   It's Christmas week and Christmas celebration prep is in full tilt.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.200]   And today we have an urgent planning question from a woman named Lonnie.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.580]   Dear Pastor John, I'm so grateful to God for your ministry and the work he has
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.340]   done for his kingdom through you.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.420]   My question came to mind as I was sitting with my husband's family
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.920]   last Christmas at the dinner table.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.140]   It's a time for the family to gather, but many family members
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.820]   don't understand Christmas.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   How do I evangelize at Christmas dinner with my unbelieving family?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400]   Is it the wrong time and place to try to proselytize people who
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.960]   I only see a few times a year?
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.060]   Where's the line of not shoving the Bible down their throat, but sharing my love for
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.200]   Jesus with people who could be going to hell when it's socially unacceptable to
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.240]   bring up something potentially controversial at a special time like Christmas dinner.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.820]   And if you were to take this opportunity, what points would you stress?
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.180]   Pastor John, what would you have to say?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.560]   I think one of the biggest mistakes that most of us make in personal evangelism,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.880]   or one of the biggest opportunities we miss, is that we are constantly hoping
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.280]   for some unusual, circumstantial turn of events or changes in situation or mood
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.560]   that will open everyone to a gospel conversation naturally, instead of simply
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.520]   asking for permission to a person or group to share something that means a great deal
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.200]   to us, or asking if we could share what we see as the best news in all the world.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.960]   For example, in totally cold turkey stranger situations, I might say, and
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   I've done this many times in my jogging evangelism, for example, I might say,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.340]   "Have you heard the best news in all the world?"
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.180]   Or that puts them a little bit on the spot because they feel like they're going to
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.440]   be an idiot if they haven't.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.980]   Or less provocatively, I might say, "May I tell you what I think is the
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.700]   best news in all the world?"
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.620]   It's very rare when somebody says to me, "No, I don't want to hear what you think
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.860]   is the best news in all the world."
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.300]   It almost never happens to me.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.100]   If somebody can sniff out that I'm a religious guy, then they might say,
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.200]   "No, no, no, I don't want to talk about that."
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   But not usually.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.120]   Now, when they say yes, I just tell them in a sentence or two that God, the Creator
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.160]   of the universe, sent Jesus Christ, His Son, into the world to bear the punishment
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.280]   for my sin so that I could be forgiven and live forever in happiness with Him.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.160]   Something like that.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   And I see where it goes from there.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.160]   Who knows?
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.580]   I mean, they may say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard of that, blah, blah, blah."
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.260]   Or they might say, "No, I've never heard that."
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.860]   And then you might go further.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.860]   Now, closer to the question that Lonnie is asking, I'm thinking about a friend or a
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.860]   group of friends or family that you have and you want to share the gospel with them.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.940]   You keep waiting for a situation that feels natural and doesn't come.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.360]   And what I'm suggesting is that you plan, plan a lunch with your friend or over lunch
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.160]   you already have planned, and you ask in all seriousness, either beforehand or in
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.960]   the lunch, if you could share with them something very precious in your own life
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.560]   because this is what you love to do with good friends or family.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.440]   This is the furthest thing from shoving the gospel down someone's throat.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.620]   You're asking for permission.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.300]   Now, with regard to Christmas dinner or all kinds of things that happen when
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.620]   families get together besides dinner, that's a principle I would commend.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.380]   Of course, so much hangs on the nature of the relationships, what they already know
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.740]   about your faith, whose house is it that you're eating at, what's the spirit or
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.980]   mood of the day, how hostile are they?
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.840]   All those things will affect how you approach this.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.720]   If it's your house and you're providing the hospitality and you're providing most
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   of the meal, then it's not at all presumptuous to pause at the beginning of
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.760]   the meal and say something about the meaning of Christmas for you.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.960]   There are all kinds of things you can do.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.640]   If it's just before the meal, it can't be long, of course, if it's going to get cold,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.000]   you might sing a familiar carol that even unbelievers know, and maybe you print it
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.120]   out for everybody, lay it on their plate, and then you pray at the end and you give
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   thanks in your own prayer for what Christmas means for you, and that's it.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.920]   You see whether it goes any further than that, but a prayer is not that unusual
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.560]   over a meal at a holiday.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.760]   Or there may be other possibilities in the day.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.520]   I would stress that.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.080]   Or Christmas Eve, where you suggest various things.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.120]   You might be surprised that people really would like to do something more
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.720]   meaningful than watch football.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.520]   I mean, of course, they may want to watch football, but deep down, deep down, even
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   those who are not Christian would like something significant to happen once or
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   twice a year in their lives that has a little more meaning than what's on
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.600]   television.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:42.600]   One possibility to suggest is that you maybe read a lighthearted story like, my
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.720]   wife read this every year for several years when our boys were at a certain age,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever," which is a funny story that takes a really
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.800]   serious twist turn at the end.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.000]   You can find it online.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.720]   You can read it in 20 minutes, half an hour, "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,"
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.800]   maybe even less than that.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.160]   Another possibility would be to start a tradition in your home and maybe invite
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.600]   others to watch the movie, "The Nativity Story."
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.160]   It's really well done.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.000]   I mention it just because it's a tradition at our household.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.720]   We just do it.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.960]   My daughter, for years, said, "We're going to watch 'The Nativity Story,' aren't
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   we?"
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   Because it's not at all lighthearted.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.680]   It's very serious.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.040]   And it's historically pretty accurate, I think.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.480]   A reconstruction of just the birth of the baby and Mary.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.920]   It's very, very moving, very powerfully done.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.680]   You can just invite people to watch it because it's so well done that I think
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.440]   even unbelievers would learn a lot from it.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.840]   Or you might, as a family, read a collection of Advent devotions starting in
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.920]   December 1.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   And then when you get to December 24, 25, you just say to your guests, "We've been
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.480]   reading every night this month, and we'd like to just read ours tonight and include
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.920]   you in it."
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.320]   And whatever's next, you read that.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   We've got two or three of those at DesiringGod, which you can download free
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.320]   anytime you want.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.120]   Just type into the search engine "Advent devotions."
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.920]   So, of course, we don't shove the gospel down anyone's throat.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.640]   But if we love Christ and if we love our family, we will pray and try to be
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.920]   proactive in our planning.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.720]   God loves to honor the simplest, even the most bumbling efforts to share his news.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.600]   So my encouragement is to pray and plan and give people as much of a heads-up as
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.720]   seems helpful, and then trust God to do more with our little efforts than may be
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.520]   humanly possible.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.200]   Some really good, provoking suggestions here.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.000]   And Lonnie, that is a great question.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.120]   Thanks for sending it in to us.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.200]   And wherever you're listening in the midst of your day, thanks for joining us.

[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.400]   Well, Wednesday, we celebrate the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the personal
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.320]   incarnation of God in the flesh, Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.560]   So why did Christ enter this world?
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.840]   What was his goal?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.920]   We'll do our part to share the good news of Christmas with others.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.640]   That's next time.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
