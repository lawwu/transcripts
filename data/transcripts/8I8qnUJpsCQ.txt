[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Due to a fault on the original recording, there is some disturbance during the early part of this sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   We do apologize for this and trust that it will not spoil your enjoyment of the message too much.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.040]   The Doctor is preaching from the Book of Genesis, chapter 26, and verses 17 to 18.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.400]   Unfortunately, the very first few moments of this sermon have been lost due to the deterioration of the Master Tape.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.240]   The Doctor is looking at the light that these two verses shed on revival in the modern Church.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.800]   The great need of the Israelites at that time was for water.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.680]   The need was so desperate that it had sent them back to their old wells, which they had found to be filled with rubble.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.880]   This left Isaac with the immediate problem of having to dig out the wells and clear them to make them suitable for use again.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.320]   We join the Doctor now as he compares this situation with the Church as it is today.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.640]   The trouble still, as it always has been at such times of declension, is due entirely to the work of the Philistines.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.120]   And the immediate task of the Church, therefore, if she is genuinely and truly concerned about revival,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:24.360]   is to understand this and to get rid of this rubbish and earth which have been poured into the wells and which are choking the supply of water.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   The way to revival is not just to say, "Let's pray about it."
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.280]   Of course we've got to pray, and I hope to emphasize that and emphasize it tremendously.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.080]   But what I am saying is this, that there is something we have to do before we pray,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.040]   because there are certain conditions attached to prayer.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.160]   To go on our knees and to utter words is not of necessity prayer.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   The Bible, from beginning to end, makes it perfectly plain and clear that God can only be approached in certain ways and on certain conditions.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.400]   And if we don't observe those conditions, we are not praying, and there will be no value in our exercises.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   Prayer, I say, has to be made according to God's way, so that before we pray there are these preliminary considerations.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.160]   Or, if you prefer me to put it in another way, let me put it like this.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   The need, we say, is the need of an outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:40.280]   But clearly, by definition, the Spirit of God can only be outpoured and can only honor his own truth.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   The Holy Spirit cannot honor a lie.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.960]   He cannot honor a negation of the truth.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:57.040]   It is the same Spirit who is poured out in revival, who led these people who wrote the books of the Bible.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.440]   It is he who has given the truth, safeguarded its writing in an infallible manner.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   It's his own truth. This is the truth of the Spirit.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:16.960]   So if we want the blessing of the Holy Spirit clearly, we must make sure that we are in a position in which we conform to his own truth.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   And we have no right to ask for nor to expect his blessing, unless we observe the conditions that he himself has laid down.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.160]   And that is why I say the first task is to get rid of the rubbish of the Philistines.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.280]   It's a painful process.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.960]   I admit freely that I would prefer not to have to do this.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   It would be much simpler to say, "Let's pray and organize prayer meetings."
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   But if we believe the Bible at all, we can't do that.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   It's a contradiction in terms.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   We have to follow the biblical order, and this comes first.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   Therefore, as we are considering this work of the Philistines, which we have to get rid of,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   we have put in the first place doubting or denying vital doctrines of the faith.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   Now you notice how I put that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   The first work of the Philistines, I say, is that they deny or cast doubt upon or neglect or ignore certain vital and essential doctrines.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   I'm not concerned about any other doctrines.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   There are doctrines and doctrines.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   There are doctrines which are absolutely essential to the Christian position.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   There are others which we believe to be right but which we cannot say are essential.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   And I'm concerned only about those bare essentials.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   This is no time, I say, for refinements.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   It's a time of being concerned about fundamentals.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   So we have been looking at some of these doctrines, and we started with the doctrine of the transcendence and the sovereignty of God.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   The God who acts and who intervenes.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   Not the God of the deists, driven away remotely into heaven,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   who no longer takes any active part in the life of his people or the life of the world.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   The transcendent, sovereign God.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   And then that led us on to some consideration of the authority of the Bible.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   And then in turn we came to the next great doctrine which is sin.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   Man in sin and under the wrath of God.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.960]   Now these, I say, are the doctrines which are always rediscovered at periods of revival.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.960]   Now that's a statement which I make without any hesitation.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   I would put it, if you like, in the form of a challenge.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   Go back and read the history of every revival that's ever been,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   and you will invariably find these are the truths that are first rediscovered.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   Man's utter dependence upon God.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   Man waiting upon God and waiting for him to act in his own time and in his own way.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   But now that brings us on to another of the most crucial and essential doctrines.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   And that, of course, is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   He is central. He is crucial.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.960]   You read your Bible and you find that he's everywhere.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   He's in the Old Testament.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.960]   It's all looking forward to him.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   It's a book of promises concerning him and his coming and what he's going to do when he comes.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   A man who doesn't find the Lord Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is spiritually blind.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   It's a book about him, pointing to him, waiting for him.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   And the New Testament, of course, is nothing but an exposition and a delineation of him.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   Your Gospels, the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, they're all about this blessed person.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   He is at the center.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   The book is a book about him in the last analysis.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   Because it is in and through him that God visits and redeems his people and provides this great salvation.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   And then take the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.960]   Where lies the need of the power of the Spirit?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   The church should be praying for a visitation of the Spirit.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   But what is the supreme work of the Holy Spirit?
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   Well, our Lord himself has told us this. It is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   He said, "He shall glorify me and bring to your remembrance all things that I have said unto you."
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   He shall not speak of himself, out of himself. No, no. He shall glorify me.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   So the supreme work of the Holy Spirit is to focus attention on and to point to and to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   And then, if you go back again to your historical evidence,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   go back and read the accounts of all the revivals that have ever been known in the long history of the church.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   And you will find invariably that the very center of the life of the church at that time has been the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   Look at it like this, if you like. Take the great hymns that were written and became so popular 200 years ago.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   So many of them written by Charles Wesley. So many of them written by Doddridge and by Isaac Watts and by William Williams and many another.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   What is the great theme of these hymns? Well, the theme of them all is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   There is nothing more typical of the eighteenth century revival and awakening than "Jesus, lover of my soul,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   let me to thy bosom fly." You see, into the midst of all that deism, all that philosophical preaching
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   that had characterized the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   came this warm, devotional, vital, spiritual preaching about the Lord Jesus Christ and people's personal knowledge of him.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   Your hymns are full of it. And you will find that it's exactly the same in every other period of movement and of revival.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:10:00.960]   All is concentrated on him. You get it in every revival.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   The favorite hymns that were sung a hundred years ago in all the countries that were visited by revival
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   were just these hymns about the person of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   And it's been the same in every revival that has been experienced everywhere in this present century.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   Very well. Is it not clear that for all these reasons, that if the Lord Jesus Christ is not crucial, central, vital,
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   occupying the very center of our meditation and our living and our thinking and our prayers,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   that we really have no right to look for revival? And yet, what is the position?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   Well, I've been reminding you that there are certain so-called sections of the Christian Church that have never experienced revival.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   I was reminding you last Sunday morning that you've never really heard of a revival in the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   Is it surprising? You see, they hide him.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   The Lord Jesus Christ is hidden very largely by the Virgin Mary.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   He is hidden by the Church herself. He is hidden by the priests and the priesthood.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   He is in the background somewhere. Of course they believe in him. Yes, but you have to go beyond all these to come to him.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   You're confronted by the Virgin. You're confronted by the Church.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   You're confronted by the priesthood and all that they do. And the Lord himself is hidden somewhere in the background.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   That's why you don't get revival in such a church.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   But this is not only true, alas, of them. This is true of many people today.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   The Lord Jesus Christ is ignored completely by so many.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.960]   You go and talk to many people, even in the Church, about religion.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   And you'll find that they'll talk to you at great length and they'll never even mention the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   I'm never tired of putting it like this because it's something that I am so familiar with in my experience as a pastor.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   People come and talk to me about these things and I put my question to them.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   I say, "Well, now, if you're unhappy about yourself, this is the way to decide.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   What if you had to die tonight? How would you feel?"
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   "Well," they say, "I believe in God."
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   "Well," I say, "all right, well now, what would you say to God? What will you say when you stand in the presence of God?
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   What are you relying on?"
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   "Well," they say, "I've always tried to live a good life. I've done my best. I've tried to do good. I've tried to avoid sin."
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   "Yes," I say, "that's very good. But nevertheless, you have sinned, haven't you?"
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   "Oh, yes, I have sinned."
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   "Well," I say, "what do you do about your sin? What will you say to God in the presence of God about your sin?"
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   "Well," they say, "I believe God's a God of love."
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   "Well, how does that help you?"
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   "Well," they say, "I believe that if I acknowledge my sin to God and ask him to forgive me, that he does forgive me.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   And I'm relying upon that. And I press them. And I go on with my questions and cross-examination.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   And on they go, giving the same sort of answer.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   The point I'm making is this. They don't even mention the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   They believe in forgiveness, and they see the need of it, and they want it.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   But they seem to think they can get forgiveness from God apart from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   They don't really see the meaning of this bread and wine, his death, his blood-shedding.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   They don't seem to understand that. They seem to think they can go to God directly without the Lord Jesus Christ at all.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   There's a great deal of so-called Christianity which is quite Christless.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   He doesn't seem to be essential at all. He doesn't seem to come in.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   He doesn't seem to be absolutely vital, so that if you blotted him out of history, these people would be in exactly the same position.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   They seem to be living very much on the level of the Old Testament saints, and not even that at times,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   because they were looking forward to the coming of the Messiah, whereas these people don't seem to see any need for him at all.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   Well, clearly, this is the work of the Philistines.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   Anything that in any way conceals the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   anything that in any way takes him out of the center and puts him anywhere else, is the work of the Philistines.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   And oh, how busy and active the Philistines have been during this present century in particular.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   There are certain things, my dear friends, about which there should be no discussion at all.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   And the first is his unique deity, his eternity.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   Did you notice those descriptions given of him by the Apostle Paul in the first chapter of that epistle to the Colossians?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   He is before all. It is by him that all things consist.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   He is eternal, co-equal with the Father. There must be no discussion about this.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   There is no time to waste in arguing with people who deny the unique deity of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   his eternity, his equality with God, and his incarnation,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   and the blessed truth about him with his two natures in one person.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   No, you go back, I say, to every period of revival, and there is no dispute about this.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   This is the thing in which they glory. This is the thing which makes their very life.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   And so I say that these things are absolute essentials.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   To me it is equally essential.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   I just don't understand the man who can say he believes all that about him and not believe in his virgin birth,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   and not believe in his miracles, and not believe in his literal, physical resurrection.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   You see, the Apostle Paul doesn't argue about this. He says, "If Christ be not risen from the dead,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.960]   then," he says, "is our preaching vain, and your faith is vain.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   You are yet in your sins."
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   Now that is the literal, physical resurrection that he is talking about in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   He isn't talking about the persistence of the Spirit of Christ.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.960]   He isn't merely arguing that, though dead, he is still able to help us.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   No, no, he is talking about the literal, physical resurrection.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   And he says, "If this isn't true, then all I've preached is wrong."
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   And yet, you see, there are people calling themselves Christians and Christian preachers today,
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   who deny the physical, literal, physical resurrection of our Lord, and say it doesn't matter.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   I say that as long as you are in that position, you have no right to pray for revival, nor to expect it.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   Because the Holy Ghost is one of the witnesses of the resurrection.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   You remember how the Apostle Peter put it?
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   He says, "And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Ghost, which God hath given to them that obey him."
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   The Holy Ghost is a witness to these things, witness to his incarnation, witness to his ministry,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   his teaching, his miracles, witness to his death, witness to his glorious, literal, physical resurrection,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   witness to his ascension.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   We are witnesses, so is the Holy Ghost.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   Well, how can you ask the Holy Ghost to bless you and to come down in power,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   when you deny the very thing that he's given to witness, the very person whom he is sent to glorify?
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   My dear friends, what's the use of saying, "Let's pray."
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   If we are not clear about these things, you'll never get out of that water
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   until you've cleared out the rubbish of the Philistines.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   Revival, above everything else, is a glorification of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   It is the restoration of him to the center of the life of the Church.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   You get this warm, personal devotion to him.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   It leads to your hymns, your anthems of praise, "Christ, the center of the life of the Church."
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   Don't you see the necessity for getting rid of this work of the Philistines in this respect?
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   There is no value in a so-called Christianity which doesn't exalt him and live for him,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   and live to testify to him.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   But that, in turn, leads me on, and I'm rushing through these things.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   Every one of them is important, but we must press on.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   That brings us to his work, his person, yes, but his work.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   What do I mean by his work?
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   Well, I want to emphasize particularly his atonement, his death upon the cross,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   his broken body, his shed blood.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   Now, I again am quoting to you the pure fact which you can check for yourselves.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   You will find that in every period of revival, always, without exception,
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   there has been a tremendous emphasis upon the blood of Christ, the blood of Christ.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   Those have been the hymns that have been sung most of all in periods of revival,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   the hymns about the blood.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   I could quote them to you in several languages.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   There is nothing more characteristic than this.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   Well, the apostle has put it again there for us in that first chapter of the epistle to the Colossians,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   "Having made peace," how did he make peace? "By the blood of his cross."
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   But, of course, I know perfectly well when I say a thing like that,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   I'm saying something that is unusual and highly unpopular at the present time.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   There are Christian preachers who think they're being clever in pouring ridicule upon this theology of blood.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   They dismiss it with scorn.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   That Old Testament religion, they say, wallowing in blood,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   the blood of bulls and of goats,
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   and all this materializing and talking about the blood of Christ.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   Of course they say that, and that is why the church is as she is.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   But in periods of revival, she glories in the cross.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   She makes her boast in the blood.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   Because, as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it,
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   there is only one way in which we can enter with boldness into the holiest of all,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   and that is by the blood of Jesus.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   This is the thing that the Holy Ghost honors.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   This is the thing to which he bears witness,
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   that the Son of God came into this world and was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   What for? For the suffering of death.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   That he might taste death for every man.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   The very nerve and center and heart of the Christian gospel is this,
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   that God hath set him forth publicly as the propitiation for our sins.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   What for? Well, that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   The very heart of our gospel is that God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   Listen to what the greatest preacher the church has ever known liked to say about himself,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world."
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   That is the thing in which he makes his burst and his glory.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   Then again he says to the Corinthians,
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   And yet men say that his death on the cross was but an accident,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   or just the death of a pacifist, or something like that.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   They don't see its cruciality. They don't see its centrality.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   They don't see that it was by dying there that he achieves our salvation,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   that it was because God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   that we are forgiven and are free.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   "Ah," they say, "it's mechanical. It's almost merchandise.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   You're making of this thing something which is almost material," they say.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   No, no, that's just a great display of the love of God, but it isn't.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   The cross is the point at which the holy, everlasting, and eternally just and righteous God
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   is making a way of salvation by visiting the punishment of our sins upon his only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   I say no hope for revival while men and women are denying the blood of the cross
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   and are pouring scorn upon that in which we should make our birth.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain,
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   They've thrown the refuse and the earth and all the rubbish upon this blessed fact of the death and the blood and the cross.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   And it's not surprising that the church is as she is.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   It's not surprising that the world is as it is.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   When our central message is being hidden, what have we?
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   There is no hope, I say, until we get rid of this work of the Philistines
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   and clear out the rubbish that is concealing the most precious truth of all.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   And that, in turn, brings me to the next doctrine, which is this one.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   The person and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   Now, here, in many ways, is the most practical of all the doctrines that I've been dealing with hitherto.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   And here, alas, I shall feel compelled to say things
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   which not only apply to the people who hitherto have been chiefly in our minds,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   those who deny the authority of the Scripture,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   those who dismiss the doctrine of sin and of atonement.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Here, alas, we shall have to say things in which, as it seems to me,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   there are many evangelicals who are also equally guilty.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   I say this, therefore, with profound regret.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   But if we are concerned about revival, it has got to be said.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   The Philistines are always concerned about concealing the person and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   If you like it in other terminology, they are guilty in various ways of quenching the Spirit.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.960]   How do they do so?
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   Well, here are some of the ways.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   One is to forget him and to ignore him altogether.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   And there are many people who ignore him and forget him altogether.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   Of course, if you ask them, they say they believe in him.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   But in practice, they ignore him.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   They forget him altogether.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   I don't stop with that.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   There are others who, while they don't forget him altogether,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   regard him only as an influence.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   They don't believe in him as a person.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   You see, there is an influence of God's Spirit.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   But they don't talk about the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   And that must grieve him terribly.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   Because our Lord talks about sending him.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   He says, "I will send you another Comforter.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   I will not leave you alone.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   I will send him and he will lead you into all truth."
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   He talks about him.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Yes, we are Trinitarians.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   We believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   And how can we expect him to visit us and to bless us if we talk about it?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   Would you like to be talked about as "it"?
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Would you like to be thought of as just an agency or a power?
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   Of course you wouldn't.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   There is nothing more insulting to a person
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   than in any way to cast doubt upon the personality.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   And that is what men and women are doing with the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   They are talking about "it."
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   An influence.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   No, no, he is a blessed person.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   He is not given the place that is indicated in our Lord's teaching
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   in chapters 14 to 16 of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   Read those again.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   Chapters 14, 15, and 16.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   And not only does he speak about the Holy Spirit as "he," as a blessed person,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   but he describes there the functions of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   He tells us what he is going to do, how he is standing at our side,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   how he speaks to us, how he prompts us,
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   how he brings back to us the truth and makes truth known to us,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   how he enlightens us and gives us understanding,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   how he shall convict the world of sin and righteousness and judgment,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   There are those who have suggested that the book which we call
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   should be called the book of the Acts of the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   and there is a great deal of truth in that.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   But you see, all this is being denied to them.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   He is not being given this place,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   which is so clearly indicated in the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   But I hurry to what is, of course, the most crucial point of all
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   in connection with the doctrine of the person and the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   in this matter, and that is the question of outpourings of the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.960]   or if you prefer, baptisms of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   And this is obviously the crucial point with regard to this whole question of revival,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   because I take it by definition that what a revival means is
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   an outpouring of the Spirit of God,
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   the Spirit of God coming in power upon a person or a number of persons at the same time.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.960]   Read the stories of revivals and that is what you'll find.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   But now, the work of the Philistines, of course, is to deny that and to dispute that,
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.960]   and it is being done by many people in many ways.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   Some people dispute that by just dismissing it as hysteria.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   Ah, they say your revivals, what you call revivals, they're nothing but mass hysteria,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   simple people getting worked up.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   You see, they say that's why you get accounts now of revivals sometimes in the Belgian Congo,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   or perhaps in certain islands of the northwest of Scotland,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   but you don't get them in a country like this.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's simple people, mass hysteria.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   You're familiar with that teaching, I take it.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   That's purely the work of the Philistines.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   And there are people who call themselves Christians who don't hesitate to say
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   that the so-called great revivals of history are nothing but evidences of mass hysteria.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   Is there anything that can be more grieving to the Spirit than that?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   They say, you know, we shouldn't expect that kind of thing in a country like this
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   with educated, sophisticated people.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   You only get that amongst primitive people.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   I know of nothing which comes nearer to blasphemy against the Holy Ghost than that.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   And may I solemnly warn you that our Lord himself taught that
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   that's to say against himself, shall be forgiven.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   But whosoever blasphemeth, he says, against the Holy Ghost,
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   shall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in that world which is to come.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:31.960]   Let us be careful, my beloved friends, lest we become guilty of this terrible blasphemy
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.960]   of attributing the work of the Holy Spirit of God
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   to something psychological, to some hysterical manifestation.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   Let us be careful as we speak about these things.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   But then there are others who, not dismissing it like that as hysteria,
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   seem to me to be equally guilty of quenching the Spirit,
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   because they argue like this.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   They say baptism of the Holy Spirit is something which is non-experimental.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   They say the baptism of the Spirit is that which happens to every man
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   when he is born again, when he is regenerated.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   So we are all baptized with the Spirit.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   We have all received this baptism, they say.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   Now remember, they are talking about the thing which is described
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   And they say, yes, that was the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but we all get that now.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   And it is unconscious, we are not aware of it, it happens to us.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   The moment we believe and we are regenerated, it is just that act of God
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   which incorporates us into the body of Christ.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   They say that is the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   So it is no use your praying for some other baptism of the Spirit
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   or asking God to pour out His Spirit upon the church
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   or to baptize the church afresh with His Holy Spirit, a baptism of power.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   No, no, this is non-experimental.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   And as it has happened to all of us, we must not ask for it.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   Or another way in which it is done is this.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   It is thought that what happened on the day of Pentecost happened once and forever,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   that it cannot be repeated,
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   and that therefore it is wrong for us to pray that the Holy Spirit may be poured forth.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   They say God on the day of Pentecost did pour forth His Spirit upon the church,
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   and the Holy Spirit has been in the church ever since.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   So they say it is actually wrong to pray for an outpouring of God's Spirit.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   Now this has been a very definite teaching.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   It was taught by a certain group and section which is very well known and familiar
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   in the Christian church in the middle of the last century,
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   and it has persisted ever since, especially in that particular group and body,
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   and it has spread and infected various other bodies also.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   Now there is the teaching.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   The Holy Spirit was poured out on the church on the day of Pentecost.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.960]   Therefore, you must never pray to God to pour out His Spirit
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.960]   or to shed forth His Spirit upon the church.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   They say it is wrong, and they have prohibited such praying.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Well, thus you see, it is not surprising that there has been no revival,
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.960]   that you do not get revival in the history of that particular group and section in the Christian church.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.960]   It is not surprising that as that kind of teaching has gained currency,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   that people have stopped praying for revival, and the church is as she is today.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   Then there are others, it seems to me, who are guilty of the same thing in this way.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   They speak only of being filled with the Spirit.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   You see, that is the thing you should concentrate on.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   Surely all that is demanded of Christian people and of church members
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   is that they should go on being filled with the Spirit.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   And as long as they are filled with the Spirit, what more is necessary?
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   You see, there is no need to pray for these baptisms or visitations that you are talking about.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Why not simply tell the people to go on being filled with the Spirit?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.960]   And so, you see, we have arrived at a position something like this,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   that all that is necessary is that we should evangelize on the one hand,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   and then we should teach the converts about the importance of going on being filled with the Spirit.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   And as long as we do these two things, nothing more is necessary.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   And I am suggesting very seriously to you that that is the main explanation
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   why people have not been praying for revival.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   They do not see the necessity of revival.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   They say if you do those two things, evangelize and go on being filled with the Spirit,
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   nothing more is necessary.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   They never think in terms of the Spirit suddenly coming down upon the church.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.960]   For instance, as it did not only on the day of Pentecost,
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   but as it did the next day or so, you will find it recorded in the fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   There were the church members all met together, they were praying to God,
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   and we are told that suddenly while they were praying,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   the Holy Ghost came down upon them,
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   and the very building, the walls of the building in which they were met were shaken.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   There was a further baptism, outpouring of the Spirit,
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   as it happened to Cornelius and his household, and as it happened in other places.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   But all that is left out, it is forgotten.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.960]   You see, the idea now is that you do not need that sort of thing.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   Evangelize, and then give this other teaching about being filled with the Spirit.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.960]   And there is no room left for an outpouring of the Spirit.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.960]   It is not expected, and it does not happen.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   And then there is a pathetic group of people,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   and in a way these are the most pathetic of all.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   Who say not only that you should not pray for a visitation of the Spirit like this,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   you should not pray for revival at all.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.960]   Why not?
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   Well, they say prophetic teaching makes it quite wrong.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   What prophetic teaching?
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   Well, they say we are living in the last days.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   The advent of Christ is at the door.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.960]   The Holy Spirit has been withdrawn.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   And if God is withdrawing the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   what right have you to pray for a coming and an outpouring of the Spirit?
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.960]   They say prophecy should make it perfectly plain to you
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   that there never can be another revival, because Christ is coming.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   And coming so quickly, there is no time for revival, and you should not even be praying for it.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   Why do I say that that is the most pathetic of all?
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Well, for this reason,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   that that whole argument and position
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   is based upon an attempt to interpret one chapter only in the Scripture,
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   the second chapter of the second epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   It is based on the assumption that that is the only possible explanation of that.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   And on the most doubtful exposition conceivable of an exceedingly difficult and doubtful passage,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   such benighted people say positively, actively,
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.960]   and imagine their being very scriptural in saying it,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   that you therefore should positively not pray for revival.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   They have fixed the times and the seasons, you see.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   The Scriptures tell us not to be concerned about times and seasons.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   The Scriptures tell us that even the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.960]   does not know the day of his second coming.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   Not only God knows it, but these people have arrived at it,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   and they are so certain of it that they say, "You must not pray for revival,"
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   and that the Holy Spirit is being withdrawn.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:51.960]   Thus, on a highly doubtful exposition of a very difficult and doubtful passage,
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   such persons, it seems to me, are guilty of this terrible sin of quenching the Spirit,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   and are partly responsible, therefore, for the terrible drought
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   and the whole condition of the Christian church at the present time.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   In other words, I would put it to you like this,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.960]   that what so many are disputing and denying and ignoring
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   is what I would call the immediate and direct action of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.960]   "Oh no," they say, "the Spirit only works through the Word,
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.960]   and you mustn't expect anything from the Spirit
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   apart from that which comes immediately through the Word."
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   And so it seems to me they are quenching the Spirit,
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   because what I read in the book of the Acts of the Apostles is this, in chapter 13,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   "The Holy Ghost said unto the church at Antioch, 'Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas.'"
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   And I read in chapter 15 that counsel in Jerusalem says,
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   "It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and unto us."
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   I read in chapter 16 that Paul was anxious to preach the gospel in Asia,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   but the Spirit suffered him not.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   He wanted to preach in Bithynia,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   and the Holy Spirit restrained him and stopped him.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   The living, powerful activity of the Spirit,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   the Spirit coming directly, as it were, and controlling and leading and guiding
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   and giving orders and indicating what was to be done,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.960]   the Spirit descending upon.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   That's what you've always got in revival.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   But that is the thing that seems to have gone entirely out of the minds of men and women.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   As I close, I would end with putting a fact to you again.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   To me it's a very striking and significant fact.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   Check what I'm going to say for yourselves.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   Look at any book which has been written on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in this present century,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   and try and find for me a paragraph or a section or a chapter on revival.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.960]   Now, here are books, you see, written on the person and the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   and they don't mention revival.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   They don't mention a visitation of God's Spirit, an outpouring of God's Spirit.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.960]   They don't even mention it.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   I'll give you the authors.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   Not a word about revival.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.960]   Why not?
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   Well, it's because of the teaching I've been describing.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   They don't believe in revivals, really.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   No, no, it's not necessary.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   All you've got to do is to go on being filled with the Spirit,
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   and you exhort the whole church to do that.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   There is no idea in their minds of the Spirit suddenly coming upon people,
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.960]   such as he always does in revival, and doing his wonderful works.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   Now, if you go back and read books which were written on the person and the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   say, around about 1860, there's this book by Smeaton and others,
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   there you will find sections on religious awakenings, religious revivals.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   They deal with it specifically.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   In the past they always did, but during the last 70 to 80 years,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   this whole notion of a visitation, of baptism, of God's Spirit upon the church,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   it's gone.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   It's not in the books.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   Evangelical writers, I'm referring to them particularly,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   they don't mention revival.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   They don't even think of it.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   And surely this is to quench the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   Because the Holy Spirit not only has what we may call his ordinary work,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   he has his extraordinary work, and that is revival.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   Of course we must evangelize.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   Of course we must preach about God being filled with the Spirit.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   Yes, but over and above that, we must cry unto God to pour out his Spirit upon the whole church.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   And that is revival.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   The descent, the outpouring of the Spirit, over and above his usual, ordinary work,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   this amazing, unusual, extraordinary thing,
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   which God in his sovereignty and infinite grace has done to the church from time to time
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   during the long centuries of our history.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   Beloved people, examine again your doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:43.960]   And in the name of God, I say, be careful, lest in your neat and trimmed doctrine
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   you are excluding and putting out this most remarkable thing,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   which God, I say, does periodically through the Holy Spirit
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   in sending him upon us, in visiting, in baptizing us again,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   in reviving the whole church in a miraculous and astonishing manner.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   Well, may God give us grace to do so. Amen.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
