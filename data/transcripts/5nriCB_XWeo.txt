[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians in the sixth chapter, verses 9, 10 and 11.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Verses 9, 10 and 11 in the sixth chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   the kingdom of God. And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Now, there is no more ridiculous charge which is brought against the Bible, or no more ridiculous
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   criticism of the Bible, it seems to me, than the criticism that because it is an old book,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   it has no longer anything to say; that because it is old, it is out-to-date, and not relevant
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   to the present position. For there is nothing, if you really know your Bible, which you will
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   find to be more remarkable about it than just this, that it is always contemporary, always
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   up-to-date, always has the exact and the precise word to say at any particular juncture or
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   stage in the long march and history of the human race.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Take this statement that I have just read to you, the one I read at the beginning out
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   of Romans 1, and these three verses that I have just read to you out of 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   They might very well have been written for just this present hour. They have the very
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   word that is needed at this particular moment. Indeed, let me put it even further to you,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   to show you this point of how contemporary the Bible always is. Those who meet here regularly
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Sunday nights will know now that since the last Sunday night of April, we have been considering
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   each Sunday night the great teaching of the Bible concerning the kingdom of God. And those
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   who attend here must have observed that I have been preaching according to a scheme.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I have had a plan and a purpose. Indeed, I planned out this whole series of sermons and
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   the ones that are to follow for the next four weeks, during that week prior to the last
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Sunday in April. And according to my scheme and to my plan, I was due to preach tonight
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   on these verses that I have just read to you. I cannot regard that as an accident, my friends.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Not only is the word of God always contemporary, but there is such a thing as being led by
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   the Spirit of God. Very well, I say that just to answer those who are still in their ignorance
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and flippancy, say, "The Bible is too old a book. It's played out. It's got nothing
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   to say." If you can produce to me any statement from any literature or any speech or anything
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   else anywhere in the world tonight that speaks so directly to this present moment as these
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   verses we are going to consider, I should be very interested to hear of you. But I know
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that you can't do so. The Bible always has the word. It always has the last word. Why?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Well, because it is what it says. It is the word of God. The Bible is not a human book.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It is not a book of human theories and ideas and opinions and suggestions. It is a book
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   written by different men who all agree in telling us that they were moved and carried
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   along by the Spirit of God. They were not writing their own opinions. They were writing
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   what God told them to write. So it is God's revelation with respect to men and his life
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   in this world. In other words, the business of the Church is to preach the Bible, to unfold
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and expand the message of this word of God. What does it give us? Well, why did God ever
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   give us the Bible? And this one text of ours answers the question. The Bible has been given
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   in order that we might be taught certain things. "Know ye not," says the Apostle, "don't
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   you know?" He expects these Corinthians to know certain things. Why? Well, because he
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   had been there preaching to them, and because Apollos had been there preaching to them.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And as the result of his preaching and that of Apollos, these people had been given knowledge,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   information, instruction. Now that is the business of the Bible. It is to give us knowledge
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   that is absolutely vital to our life in this world and in the world to come. Or, if I may
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   put this in a different way, according to the Bible, all our troubles as men and women
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   in this world arise from one fundamental cause, and that is ignorance of certain basic, fundamental
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   truths. The ultimate trouble with men is that he is ignorant. He needs to be taught certain
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   things plainly and clearly. And God has given us the Bible in order that we might be taught
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   these very things. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into this world for exactly the
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   same reason. "I am come," he says, "a witness unto the truth." He says, "I am the light
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   of the world." And when he says he is the light of the world, he says, "I am the knowledge
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   that the world needs. I am the only one that can enlighten men and women. I am the only
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   one who can open their eyes and bring them out of darkness to knowledge. I am the light
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   of the world." He came to teach about God, about men, the way of salvation, and all these
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   matters. Very well, that is the great function of the Bible, to give us this knowledge, knowing
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   it. And the way in which the Bible gives us this knowledge is most remarkable. We have
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   got a very perfect example and illustration of it in these words that we are looking at
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   tonight. You see, the Bible is not some kind of fairy tale. People think it is. They say,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   "The sky in the sky, the Bible is unrealistic." The Bible unrealistic? My dear friend, it
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   is the only book in the world I know that is real and realistic. It is a book of facts.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It is a book of history. It is a book that tells us the plain, unvarnished truth about
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   ourselves. Look at that first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. What a description
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   of life as it is. It does not spare us anything. And this one we are looking at here is exactly
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   the same. In other words, the Bible comes and it does not paint some wonderful fairy
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   tale and give us a nice feeling inside us and tell us we are all going to heaven and
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   all going to be happy. No, no. The Bible is a book that looks you in the face, examines
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   you in the depth, tells you the truth about yourself, unvarnished, exposes it all. And
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   then it proceeds to deal with the two main questions. It says, "That is life." And it
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   is the Bible alone which tells us what life is really like in this world. Your newspapers,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   they boast about making revelations. They claim to examine and to give true reports,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   but they do not, of course. They pick out certain facts now and again. But if you really
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   want to know the truth about yourself, do not go to a newspaper. The newspapers are
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   always praising us. They are always playing up to us. They would not sell if they did
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   not. They exist on the numbers of papers that they sell. The newspapers are liars about
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   the fundamental problems of life. They do not know them. They are partly the cause of
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   the present muddle. They are not the organs that reveal the truth about men and about
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   society and about this nation. The Bible is the only book in the world that does that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   It is the only honest book. It is the only truthful book. And it is, I say, because it
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   is the word of God. And then, having put the facts before us in this unvarnished manner,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   almost violent manner, the Bible then deals with two questions. It now tells us, first
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   of all, why things are like that. That is the first thing we want to know, is it not?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It is not enough, you know, just to talk about the scandal. The question is, why is there
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   such a thing? Now, that is what the Bible tells us. It gives us the cause and the explanation
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   of why things are as they are. And then, secondly, thank God, it tells us about the only way
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   in which these things can be put right. Now, that is a summary to you of the whole of the
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   message of the Bible. The Bible has just got those two points. Why is man as he is? Why
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   is the world as it is? How alone man and the world can be put right? That is the great
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   message of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. And that is what we have got in the most extraordinary
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   summary form in these three verses that we are looking at at this moment. And all I want
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   to do is to hold them before you. What is it that we need to be taught? Know ye not?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Are you in ignorance of these matters? What are they? Well, the first is this. The first
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   thing that we need to be taught is the terrible danger of being deceived. Know ye not that
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived. Don't be deceived.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Now, there is the first danger. Everywhere the Bible warns us against this terrible danger
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   of being deceived. Indeed, we can put it like this, that the case of the Bible from beginning
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   to end is that man is in ignorance because he has been deceived. The whole story of the
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   human race has gone wrong because man has been deceived by the devil. Now go back, Genesis
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   3, there it is. God makes the world, makes it perfect, makes man perfect, puts him in
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   paradise. Well, he should have lived happily, he should have enjoyed the companionship of
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   God, and he would have been given the gift of immortality, and that would have been the
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   story. But it hasn't been the story. The story has been one of unhappiness, jealousy, envy,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   murder, wars, all the horrors that are depicted in the Bible and that we are familiar with
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   in secular history. Why has the history of the human race and of the world been what
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   it has been? And the Bible says there's only one answer. The devil came in, and we are
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   told of the devil that he's more subtle, he was more subtle than any of the beasts
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   of the field. And it was in his subtlety, in his deceitfulness, that he deceived Adam
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   and Eve. That's a point which is made in many places in the Holy Scriptures. We are
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   told by this same apostle in his second epistle to these very Corinthians, in the eleventh
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   verse, he puts it like this, "I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." That's the trouble. It is always
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   the trouble. You see, you get the same thing taught exactly in the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "Who all his people in this way exhort one another," he says, "daily, while it is
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   called today, 'Lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.'" That's
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   the whole cause of the trouble. Man's story has been what it's been because he has been
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   deceived by the devil and the deceitfulness of sin. Now that has been the trouble, according
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   to the Bible, from the very dawn of history. It was the trouble in the time of the apostle
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Paul, in the time of our Lord himself, he teaches the danger of men who have even listened
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   to the gospel being deceived by the deceitfulness of riches. That's the seed sown amongst the
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   thorns, you remember, the deceitfulness of riches. Men are deceived by this and are
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   kept from understanding the real meaning of life. And he prophesies that it's going
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   to be like that even unto the very end of the age. He says, "As it was in the days
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   of Noah, even so it shall be. As it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, even so it
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   shall be." There it is. Deceit is the central and the most essential trouble with the human
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   race. Now then, there is always this danger of our being deceived. "Don't be deceived,"
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   says Paul. "Don't be misled. Don't be fooled." And the same thing needs to be said to this
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   modern generation. And there are certain respects in which, in particular at the present time,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   the human race is in danger of being deceived. What are they? I've made a list of them.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Here's the first. The first is, as I have already said, that the Bible cannot speak
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   to us now because, well, it was written nearly 2,000 years ago and longer even than that.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And we've learned so much since. We've advanced so much. We've got such wonderful
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   new knowledge. And man advances and becomes better from age to age. We believe in evolution,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   in the advance and the development. How can an old book like this speak to us any longer?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   That is one of the signs and master strokes of the devil and his brilliance. He prevents
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   men even reading the Bible. They won't even listen to it. They put it out of court. So
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   they're bereft of the one message that can help them. And he puts it on their... He deceives
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   them in that way, into thinking that the devil, that the Bible, I say, has got nothing to
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   teach modern men. Well, no, if we'd got nothing but my text tonight, we've got more than enough
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   to answer that, haven't we? We are told the Bible doesn't speak to us today because we
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   are different. Well, what are we like? This is what they were like 2,000 years ago. Fornicators,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, thieves, covetous,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   frunkards, revilers, extortioners. Are we no longer like that? There's no need to say
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   any more, is there? The present crisis is because some of us are like that. So the Bible is
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   speaking to men as he is tonight. He's the same as he always was. Don't be deceived,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   my dear friend. This book is speaking to you now. It's as up-to-date as it was 2,000 years
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   ago. Secondly, the second manner of deceit is to say that moral ideas change. Have you
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   been listening to the people being interviewed by the television, gentlemen? They go around
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   with their microphones. "What do you think of this crisis?" "Well," they say, "so many
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   of them, you know, 20 years ago I'd have been horrified at this, but now we've got new ideas
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   now. We don't think as our fathers used to think. We don't think as they thought 100
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   years ago. We don't think as they thought in the times of the Bible. We've got knowledge.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   What they regarded as sin we can explain biologically. We can explain it medically. We can explain
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   it psychologically." They say, "Of course, you know, people used to be very ignorant,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   and they used to condemn things, but with our new knowledge and our new understanding,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   we no longer think like that." In other words, you see, they say morality is something relative.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   There is no such thing, they say, as an absolute morality. There are no eternal principles
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and truths. What may be right for one generation is wrong for another. What was wrong for one
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   is right for the next. And so we are being told now that fornication is not always wrong.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Sometimes it's right and a good thing, we're told. Adultery is not always wrong. Sometimes
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   it may be right. Homosexuality is no longer wrong. It can be absolutely right for certain
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   people. To tell a lie is not always wrong. If you want to show your love to your family
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and shield them and protect them from harm, it may be right in some circumstances. Everything's
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   relative. No eternal standard of morality and of righteousness and of truth. That's
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   the modern teaching. And I'm here to say tonight that according to the Bible, that is nothing
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   but sheer deception. Be not deceived, my dear friend. You have no knowledge that entitles
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   you to change moral canons and principles. None at all. Your psychology does not answer
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   which school of psychology you belong to. They're cancelling one another out. And they're
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   all in the melting pot at the moment, in a sense. There is no scientific knowledge that
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   in any way affects these moral canons. None. Man's making his own laws just to please himself
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and to excuse himself and condone his evil. And so you get the present moral muddle. That's
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   the second form of deceit. But here's the third. And this is perhaps in many ways the
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   most serious one I've mentioned so far. It is this. That you can have morality without
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   godliness. Now that's been the cause of the trouble in my opinion. The moral standards
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   in this country have been slipping and have reached their present deplorable position
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   for one main reason. Namely, that we have been taught that you can have morality without
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   godliness. Which they interpret like this. That the moral teaching of the Bible is very
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   good, but we can't possibly accept today its theology, its doctrines. Now there was a man
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   who put this very clearly, a man who was highly respected. He was a great man and a good man,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I have no doubt in a moral sense. But to me he struck at the very foundations, not only
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   of Christianity, but of morality in which he was so interested. I'm referring to the
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   late Lord Burkitt. These are the men in my opinion who have sold the past. This is what
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   he said. He was being interviewed on the television. And he was reminded that once upon a time
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   he'd been a Methodist local preacher. But he's no longer a Methodist local preacher.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Why? What was the reason? "Oh, well," he said, "you know, as one gets on and one learns
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and one finds things out, well, there's a change." He says, "No, I no longer believe
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   the doctrines of Christianity. I hold on to the ethic," he said. "I hold on to the ethic
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   of course. The ethic of Jesus," he says, "is the highest ethic the world has ever had.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I no longer believe the doctrines." That's the teaching, that you can hold on to the
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   ethic without the doctrines. You can have morality without godliness. And that has been
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   the fatal teaching that has landed us in the present moral morass. Men have fondly believed
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   that you could hold on to these good things that have been taught by Christianity while
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   shedding the whole basis of Christianity. The modern position is demonstrating to us
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   in a particularly painful, poignant manner that you cannot have morality without theology.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   That if you shed the doctrine, you'll soon lose your morality. And as a nation, we've
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   lost it. Now there is the next, but let me hurry to another one. The other way, the next
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   way in which men deceive themselves is this, is to say that death is the end and that there's
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   nothing beyond it. That's the common belief today that when a man dies, that that's the
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   end of the story. He's finished, his life is gone, his body's put in a grave, there's
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   the end of him. But on what grounds do you say that? What basis have you for saying that?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   My dear friend, it is sheer deceit. You're being deceived. Men say, "I no longer believe
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   in life after death." But they can't prove it, it's a mere assertion, it's a mere theory,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   it's a mere statement. But people believe it, and because they believe it, they've ceased
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   to worship God. It is pure deceit. Be not deceived. And then the last one that I mention
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   is this, that God, if there is a God, is entirely love. And therefore, because God is love,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   there is really no moral standard, there is no judgment, there is no punishment, and there
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   is no hell. That is something that's being ridiculed, of course. The idea that God is
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   a righteous judge, and that he's going to judge the whole world at the end of time,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and that some people are going to be punished in hell everlasting, out upon the suggestion
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   they say, "It is impossible, it cannot be true, it isn't true." And they haven't a vestige
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   of truth, of proof for what they're saying. It is just sheer deceit. They're being deceived
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   by the devil, into believing that God is entirely love, and that we need never fear a judgment,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   we mustn't talk about any form of punishment whatsoever, and no form of retribution.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Well, now I say that all these are but examples of the modern deceit, for the answer to them
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   is given in our very passage tonight. These are the facts. "Be not deceived. Know ye
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" In other words, the answer
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to the modern deceit is this, that God is. That God is our maker and creator, and that
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   what matters is what God says, not what we think, not what we think God should say. That
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   God is what he is, not what we think he ought to be. That we can't conjure up a picture
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   of God. That we, by philosophy, can't create a God. That's what we're trying to do, and
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   dignitaries in the Church are doing it, and I hold them largely responsible for the present
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   moral collapse. I'm not interested in the denunciations of bishops of what's happening
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   at the present time, when they themselves deny the essence of the gospel. They are in
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   many ways the fathers of the moral collapse. You can't, I say, separate godliness from
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   morality. And the great statement of the Bible is that God is over all. He's made us and
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   not we ourselves, and that we are all in his hands, and that it is what he says that matters,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   not what we say. We say there are no moral standards, they're always changing. We say
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   it doesn't matter, God is love and all's going to be well. The Bible says, "Be not deceived."
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   "The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God." That's what God says. And there
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   is no excuse for our ignorance, there is no excuse for our being deceived. God has revealed
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   this to us. He's revealed it from the very beginning of history. There's no need to be
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   uncertain as to what God wants and expects and demands of us. God has made it perfectly
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   plain. He started off, you see, even in the Garden of Eden itself. He made this known
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   to Adam and Eve. He said, "If you keep my commandments, I'll bless you. If you don't,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   out you'll go." And out they went, and they've been out ever since.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   There is, my dear friend, an eternal law of righteousness. God's law is an absolute law.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   It's in the heart of every man, it's in all our consciences. He's written his law in our
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   hearts as well as promulgating it in an external sense as he did in the Ten Commandments. But
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   not only has God made it plain and clear that there is a moral standard, a moral law, what
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   he demands, he makes it equally clear that there is to be a judgment. "Know ye not that
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" Be not deceived, these people whom
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   he mentions shall not inherit the kingdom of God. What does this mean? Well, you see,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   this is just another way of saying this. Every man in this world is in one of two positions.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   He is either in the kingdom of God or else he's not in the kingdom of God. That's the
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   question. Have you inherited the kingdom of God or haven't you inherited the kingdom of
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   God? You see, that's judgment. The whole of the human race is in one of these two positions,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and all of us will have to stand before God, and we find ourselves either in the kingdom
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   of God or else outside the kingdom of God. That's judgment. And you see, the Bible's
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   message is that this is the most important thing in the whole world. Why? Well, for this
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   reason, that this is what determines our everlasting state and condition. That's why the apostle
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Paul was so anxious about these people. He says, "Don't be deceived. Don't let the devil
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   deceive you. Don't let him deceive you into saying, 'I'm in the kingdom of God. I can
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   therefore drink and commit adultery and do everything I like. God forgives me.'" Oh,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   he says, "Look here, if you go on like that, you're outside the kingdom and you're going
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   to hell." Judgment, damnation! This is what the modern world no longer believes. This
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   is what Great Britain no longer believes, and that is why Great Britain is as she is.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   There's no fear of God. Every man's his own God. Every man does what he thinks is right.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Why shouldn't he? And people explain him and condone it. They may, in a pharisaical manner,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   or jump on a certain man, but they're guilty of the same things themselves in their thoughts.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   There is no fear of God before their eyes. It's arrogant rebellion against God, but it's
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   facing a God who is a judge eternal, who's going to judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And this is the vital thing, that the judgment will send us either to heaven or to hell.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   It's either eternal bliss or eternal misery. Everybody's concerned about the state of the
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   country, but have you heard anybody talking about the state of the soul and eternal destiny?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   That's the thing that matters. And it matters to every one of us. Here, then, is one of
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   the first things the Bible teaches us, this terrible, horrible danger of being deceived.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   But let me hurry to the second thing it teaches us, and that is that nothing matters in the
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   sight of God but righteousness. "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   kingdom of God?" In the sight of God, there's only one thing that matters with respect to
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   men. What is it? Not ability and cleverness. This is the vogue and the cult of the clever
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   men today, isn't it? Clever. "He's clever," they say. "He's brilliant." "No, no," says
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   the Bible. Not ability and cleverness. Not knowledge, culture, sophistication. Men about
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   town, the clever people, interested in art, interested in all one sophistication. "No,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   no," says the Bible. Enjoyment and pleasure. Money, wealth, never had it so good. That's
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   what we've been told, isn't it? That's the thing that matters. Plenty of money, never
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   had it so good, and the country's never been so bad. No, no, in the sight of God there's
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   only one thing that matters. It is righteousness. What is this? Well, it means, if you like,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   character. The only thing that matters in the sight of God, thank God, is character.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's not whether I'm clever or lacking in ability. It's not whether I'm learned or
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   ignorant. It's not my bank balance or lack of bank balance. No, no, it's what I am. It's
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   my character. It's my soul face to face with God. Righteousness. This is the only thing
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   that matters with God in a nation or in an individual. Righteousness exalteth a nation.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Not cleverness. Righteousness. Where there is no vision, the people perish, though they
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   may be great and have been great and sing the glories of the past. Where there is no
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   vision, where people live for sport and pleasure and money and getting on and cleverness, where
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   there is no vision, the people perish. Rome perish. Others have perished since. Is this
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   country perishing? Where there is no vision, no knowledge of righteousness, the people
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   perish. I say nothing matters in the sight of God but just this matter of righteousness.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   God revealed it in the Garden of Eden. He revealed it in the Ten Commandments. His own
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   people have always realized it. Listen to the psalmist. "Who shall ascend into the hill
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   of the Lord and who shall dwell in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   heart." Not your clever fellow. Not your brilliant men of affairs. Not the men who
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   can speak cleverly. The sophisticated modern men about town. No, no. Clean hands, pure
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   heart. That's what God wants. David understood it. He said, "Thou desirest truth in the inward
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   parts." "Yes," says our Lord, "if your righteousness shall not exceed the righteousness of the
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God." He says it
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   again, "Ye are they that justify yourselves before men, but God seeth your hearts. And
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that which is highly esteemed amongst men." You get on. You're a cabinet minister. You're
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   praised by men. "Highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Righteousness. Man was meant to live as God made him and as God made him to live. Man
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   was meant to live to the glory of God and to keep his commandments. He was meant to
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   be upright. He was meant to be pure and clean and honest and noble. He was put upon his
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   feet that he might look into the face of God and enjoy his companionship. That's righteousness.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   But, you see, the Bible goes on to say that not only is that the only thing that God demands
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   of us, it goes on to tell us that we are all unrighteous by nature. There is none righteous,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   no, not one. In spite of all the divisions into class and education and money and all
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   the rest of them, all are unrighteous. Unrighteousness takes different forms. We're not all guilty
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   in detail of these particular sins, but we're all sinners.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   There are many in this land tonight who are guilty of these very sins that are mentioned
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   in the list. The fact that you may not, my dear friend, doesn't mean that you're
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   unrighteous. To be righteous means that you love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and all your soul and all your mind and all your strength, and that you love your neighbor
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   as yourself. Are you righteous? Are you living to the glory of God and to his praise? That's
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   righteousness. None are righteous. The whole world lieth guilty before God, all of sin
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and come short of the glory of God. What's the cause of this? The Bible tells us, and
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   this is the vital message. Every one of us born into this world is unrighteous because
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   men fell from God. Adam was righteous until he listened to the devil. He fell and became
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   unrighteous. And man is unrighteous still because he's turned his back upon God. He's
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   a rebel against God, and he's become the slave of the devil and the slave of these
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   lusts and passions. He becomes debased, depraved, disgusting, vile, a miserable slave because
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   he has turned his back upon God.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   There is the second great thing that is taught us in the Bible, that nothing matters in the
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   sight of God and in the presence of God but righteousness. And there we see ourselves
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   all condemned, all sinners, and all unrighteous. But thank God the gospel doesn't stop there.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It tells us all this. We need to know it. Be not deceived. No unrighteous person shall
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   inherit the kingdom of God. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   you. But, and there comes your gospel, and here is the essential message of the gospel.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   "But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." Let me tell you what the message of the gospel
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   is. What has the gospel got to say to this modern position in England at this moment?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   What has the gospel got to say about this deplorable state in which we find ourselves
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   as a nation? And it's not only true of this nation. It's true of all the nations.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   What's the message? Well, let me tell you in a hurried word what it isn't. It isn't
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   a mere message of denunciation of sin. You don't need to be a Christian to do that.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Your moral men are holding up their hands in horror tonight. Not Christians, but they're
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   moral men, and they are denouncing. You don't need to be a Christian to denounce sin. Neither
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   is the message of the church merely one of exhortation or merely one of appeal. I read
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   of a church dignitary saying that we must clean up the stables the other day. Clean
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   up the stables. And they're all expressing their opinions upon this moral degeneracy
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   and so on. My dear friends, that's nothing but pharisaism. Our Lord has dealt with that
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   once and forever. Do you remember the story told at the beginning of the eighth chapter
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   of John's gospel? They brought a woman to him that had been caught in the very act of
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   adultery. And they rushed her into his presence. And they wanted to know what his verdict was
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   on the case. And he, you remember, instead of answering them, began to write on the sand
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   on the ground. And they were pressing him, and he looked at them and said, "He that
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   is without sin amongst you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her." And they all
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   slinked out quietly and as quickly as they could, leaving the woman and our blessed Lord
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   together alone. Be careful what you're doing, my friend. It's a very simple thing to point
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   a finger of scorn at a man and to condemn a man. What of you? Is your heart clean? Are
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   your hands clean? Be careful. Examine yourself. It's an easy thing to make scapegoats. I'm
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   not here to defend any man, nor anything that has done. There is no defense for sin. But
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I am here to say this, that the Gospel doesn't merely denounce it. It doesn't merely make
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   a moral appeal. We are going to hear a lot of that in the future. You'll hear great appeals
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   to the nation, to pull together. And we're going to put up a show of being Christian
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   again. It's of no value. It's sham. It's Phariseeism.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It is merely a message of denunciation of sin and the sinner. Neither is it just an
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   appeal for more moral education or any other form of education. The last thing I want to
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   do is to be political, and I'm not political in what I'm going to say. The last thing I
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   am anxious to do is to knock a man when he's in trouble and in difficulties. But I am
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   constrained to say that I couldn't for the life of me understand the mentality of the
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Prime Minister when at a ceremony in Brighton he uttered these words last Tuesday, July
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   the 11th, June the 11th. He was speaking, you remember, at the graduation ceremony in
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   connection with the new Sussex University. And in the present position this is what he
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   said. "The strength of a nation depends on its education." "The strength of a nation
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   depends on its education." Education, he went on, is the key to unlock the storehouse
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   of the future. "The most valuable national asset was the brain, imagination, and creative
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   power of our people." Now, if he had said that education was a good thing, I'd agree
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   with him. But when he tells us that the strength of a nation depends on education, when he's
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   in a terrible predicament at this moment because one of his own ministers who had received
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   the best education that this country can give, I frankly don't understand his reasoning.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   "Education," he says, "is the strength of a nation. It is the key to unlock the storehouse
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   of the future." And yet his very problem is in a man who has had the best that education
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   can give him, and who yet is a moral failure. This is not a political remark because the
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   other political parties say exactly the same thing. They all believe that education is
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   the solution and the savior. They teach materialism. "What we want is plenty of money, plenty
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   of education. Let's educate our people." And yet here are the facts flying in their
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   faces. Education is not enough. Education is not the key. Education is not the strength
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   of a nation. It is your best-educated people who are some of the ringleaders in vice and
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   evil, and who can sink to these deplorable levels. No, no, the message is not one of
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   education. Neither is it merely to tell men and women to believe in Christ and to say,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   "Lord, Lord," and say that everything is then all right. That's the very thing that
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Paul is warning these Corinthians against. Here were these members of the church at Corinth,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   and yet some of them were guilty of foul and terrible sins. He has mentioned them in the
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   fifth chapter. And they thought they were all right because they believed in Christ.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And there are many today, too many by far in our churches, they say, "I took my decision
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   for Christ. I gave myself to Christ." And they think that puts them right. They can
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   live as they like. Antinomianism, living in sin, living in dishonesty, living carelessly,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   slackly, and saying, "Lord, Lord, it doesn't work, my friend." The unrighteous shall not
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   inherit the kingdom of God. Merely to say that you believe is not enough. That's not
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   the gospel. So I'm afraid that we are going to see a good deal of this. We shall have
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   now some kind of moral cleansing, and people will attend services, and we'll be told in
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   the press that the cabinet ministers are attending services, and people are showing an interest
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   in religion. If it isn't a change in heart, it's a lie. It is deceit again.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Unappearance and attendance at the house of God is not enough, though it is a good and
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   an excellent thing in itself. What is the message of the gospel, then? Well, thank God
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   it's here. It is a message of salvation. We don't denounce sinners. We save them.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   We don't point a finger of scorn at them like a Pharisee. We go to them and say, "Look
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   here, you can be delivered out of this. You can be washed. You can be cleansed and renewed.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   You can be justified in the name of the Lord Jesus." It's a message of hope. It's a message
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   of salvation. But let's make sure that we've got the message of the New Testament, not
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   the message of the Bishop of Woolwich, not the message of the Bishop of Suffolk. No,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   no, the message of the New Testament, the old, old gospel, this plain, unvarnished word.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   This is the message, and it is a message of salvation. It gives a hope for the vilest.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Why? Well, because it doesn't merely appeal to men to pull themselves together. It tells
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   them that God will take hold of them. It is the power of God unto salvation to every one
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   that believeth. It is a message that comes to men and women in the depth of degradation
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   and sin and evil, and tells them that they can be converted, that they can be saved,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   that they can be renewed. Listen, let me read it again to you. "They not deceived, neither
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you." That's what she was, says
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Paul. But you are no longer that. Why? Oh, because you have been washed. You haven't
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   done it. You have been washed. You have been sanctified. You have been justified in the
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   name of the Lord Jesus and by the power of our God. I am privileged to preach a gospel
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   that can wash us from the filth of sin, a gospel that can cleanse us and purify us from
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   the pollution of sin, a gospel that can absolve us from its guilt and give us a robe of righteousness
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   to stand in the presence of our holy God. This is a gospel that not only preaches forgiveness,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   it preaches renewal, it preaches a rebirth, it preaches a regeneration, it preaches a
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   new man can rise out of the ashes of the failure and walk as a saint before God. "He was,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   but such were some of you, but you have been washed, you have been sanctified, and you
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   have been justified." How does it happen? He answers the question, "In the name of
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God." This is the Christian message, that the Son
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, came out of heaven into this world in order to save us.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   He didn't come merely to teach us and to exhort us and to condemn our sin and say,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   "This is how to live. Follow me." He knew we couldn't. Here we are, guilty of lusts
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and passions, slaves, and we're all slaves of something. Isn't there something that
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   gets you down? Don't you feel ashamed as I'm speaking? What of that sin you keep
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   on repeating? Why don't you stop it? You're a slave to it, that's why. You're a creature
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   of lust and passion. It may not be adultery, but it may be jealousy and envy and malice
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   and spite and hatred or an inordinate ambition and pride in the things of this world. That's
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   lust, that's slavery. He didn't come to condemn us. He didn't come to exhort us.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   He didn't merely come to give us an example. He came to save us. And it's the power of
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   God alone that can save us. He came, what for? Well, to reconcile us to God. This justifying,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   that's our trouble. We are guilty before God. And how can we have communion? And how
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   can we be blessed when we are guilty? I can't undo my past. I can't live the law.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   What can I do? Christ came and he's done it for me. He became man. He put himself
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   under the law. He's kept it. He's borne my sins in his own body on the tree. He's
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   been smitten for me. And in him God forgives me and he takes his righteousness and puts
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   it on me. Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus. When an adulterer or a fornicator or
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   a man who lies to his wife or a murderer or even a pervert of the worst type, when he
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he is delivered. He's washed. He's justified. He's
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   sanctified. The Christ of God has come to deliver him, to lift him out and to set him
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   upon his feet and establish his goings. I'm not here to denounce a poor man who's a
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   sinner like I am. I'm here to tell him, if he could but hear my words and God grant
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   that he may, that he can be delivered. He can be pardoned. He can be renewed. He can
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   start a new life in Jesus Christ our Lord. That's the Christian message. Not your
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   fariseism, not your decency and pretense and play-acting at religion, but new men with
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   righteousness in their hearts and the righteousness of Christ upon them, living for the glory
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   of God, born again entirely new men. This is it. And it is all possible because the
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came from heaven and died on that cross. We're going
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   to remember it in the bread and the wine. His body was broken. His blood was shed. What
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   for? That you might be washed in it and delivered from the guilt and the power of sin by it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   And then the Spirit comes into you and gives you power and strength and might and makes
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   you more than conqueror. Here's the gospel. Thank God it is. We don't merely point fingers
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   and condemn. We do condemn. But we wound in order to heal. We knock down in order to lift
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   up. We show men their guilt and their helplessness and their woe, that they may submit to the
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   power of God and to salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   What of you, my friend? Forget the case for the moment and consider yourself. Are you
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   righteous? Are you ready to stand in the presence of God at the bow of eternal judgment?
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Are you living a righteous and a holy life? Are you clean? Are your hands clean? Is your
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   heart clean? Is your mind clean? Is your imagination clean? What of you? Forget everybody. Start
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   with yourself. And realize tonight that you need to be washed. You need to be sanctified,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   separated from the world and to God by the Spirit, clothed with the righteousness of
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Jesus Christ. Oh, my dear friend, have you seen it? Can you use the words that were written
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   by John Newton? "The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day, and there
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   have I, though as vile as he, washed all my sins away." Have you? Have you seen this
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   message? And are you ready to say, "I hear thy welcome voice that calls me, Lord, to
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   thee, for cleansing in thy precious blood that flowed on Calvary. I am coming, Lord,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   coming now to thee. Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary." If you've
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   not realized your need of cleansing, you are in no position to point a finger at somebody
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   else. You are unclean yourself. If you haven't seen that nothing but the blood of Christ
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   can cleanse you from the guilt and the power of sin, you are not a Christian, you are a
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   miserable, self-righteous Pharisee. See your own blackness and darkness and filth and pollution.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   Turn to him and say, "I am coming, Lord, coming now to thee. Wash me, cleanse me in
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   the blood that flowed on Calvary." And you know when you're washed and when you're
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   cleansed, you'll have a little bit of sympathy with fallen men and women. You won't make
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   a sensation of it and talk self-righteously. You'll be sorry for them. You'll pray for
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   them. You'll want to tell them the message that they can be delivered. Why do they live
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   this filthy life? It's because they don't know of a better one. It's because they're
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   ignorant of the gospel. It's because they're being deceived by the devil and by modern
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   learning, often preached by the Christian church herself. And the only people who can
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   help moral failures in this world and be of any value in society at this moment are men
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   and women who, having realized their own filth, their own vileness, their own impurity, their
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   own utter hopelessness, have turned to him and have said, "Rock of ages, cleft for
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   me, let me hide myself in thee. Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   be of sin, the double cure. Cleanse me from its guilt and power." And they've turned
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   to him and he's washed and cleansed them. And they can tell others that they have but
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   to do the same thing. And they will know the moral spiritual cleansing that the Son of
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   God alone can give, and the new walk and the new life which the Holy Spirit of God alone
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   can enable one to walk. He are washed, that he are sanctified, that he are justified in
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. Thank God, in spite of our present
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   position, there is a hope tonight. It's the only hope. It is the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   and him crucified, dead for our transgressions, raised again for our justification. Do you
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   know him? Are you resting upon him? Have you been washed and cleansed and renewed by him?
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Amen.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
